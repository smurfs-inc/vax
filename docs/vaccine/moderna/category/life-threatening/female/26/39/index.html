No appetite. Struggled to read and process things. Could not work. Sharp pains in lymph nodes at various times throughout the day. Chest felt very tight and arm hurt to the point I thought I might be having a heart attack. Had trouble sleeping due to lymph node pain. Ibuprofen did not help. The arm pain at injection site was annoying but I barely noticed it due to my other symptoms.

I was sitting on the couch, and my partner noticed I have having a seizure, he lowered to me to the ground and called the ambulance. My seizure lasted for 1 minute.  When I was in the ER, they gave me 2 bags of fluids, they did an X-ray, CT scan, blood work, and UA, they reported to me that all the result were normal. They did not send me home with any medications. However, they did not clear me to drive. They said that I need to get cleared by a neurologist before I can drive, so that?s why I have not been back to work?

                                                I had just finished my cycle the day before. I woke up Mon morning to thick, clotted blood. I contacted my provider and I was instructed to take a pregnancy test, which was positive. I went in for an exam on the 12th and they confirmed that I was indeed pregnant. They tested my Beta Hcg twice. I didn&#39;t get my results immediately due to one site being closed due to COVID. I could&#39;ve gone to the hospital and received the results immediately, but my doctor didn&#39;t want to take the chance due to the hospital having a lot of COVID. They confirmed that I was pregnant on the 19th or 20th. I bled for a few days after that. The final Beta Hcg was done and my level was 0.

                                                I was having intense chest pain, weakness/faintness feeling a few days after second dose of Moderna vaccine. I went into the ER after 4th day of pain.   ER did a CT scan and found a couple blood clots in my right lung (pulmonary embolisms) along with tissue  on lung. An ultrasound of my heart and legs were done to find the source of these blood clots and neither tests found blood clots or indicators that this is where they originated.   I am currently in blood thinners in order to reduce the clots.

Here, she is slightly tachycardic, but her oxygen level is good, her lungs are clear.  She has no urticaria, she has no stridor or wheezing.  She does not wish to receive epinephrine because she has had such bad effects from it in the past, and is agreeable to Solu-Medrol and Benadryl.  She took Pepcid prior to having her injection.  Her friend who is with her recommends that she has a history of severe events like this in the past, and she usually does better after breathing treatment.

                                                severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis; hallucinations; accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml; nightly terrors; fear of dying; intermittent delusions that children were taken away; intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin; This case was received via an unknown source (no reference has been entered for a health authority or license partner) on 17-Mar-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 17-Mar-2021.    This spontaneous case was reported by a pharmacist and describes the occurrence of HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) and ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) in a 30-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 031A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (Medical history was not provided).    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 3 milliliter. In March 2021, the patient experienced SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin). On 17-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml). On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 17-Mar-2021 to 18-Mar-2021 due to ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION. In March 2021, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) had resolved. On 17-Mar-2021, ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml) had resolved. At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinations), SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient did not have any psychological history; this was the first time she experienced hallucinations.  Treatment for the severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis included intravenous steroids and hydrocortisone.  Treatment for hallucinations included droperidol and lorazepam.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event (anaphylactic reaction), a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It started as spotting that night, (I never spot) then a gradually heavier flow, working up to an unusually heavy &amp; painful period over the course of the next 2 days. Also some very light clotting, which rarely happens for me. I was not due for my period for 2.5 weeks. My cycle is extremely regular and has never deviated from 28-31 days in the last 6&#43; years. I have a copper IUD (for 6 years), and have never been pregnant.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

I took a home pregnancy test the week of 1/3/2021, which came back positive.  On 1/17/2021, I started having some spotting and saw my OBGYN on 1/18/2021.  My OBGYN did a transvaginal ultrasound and estimated I was about 5 weeks pregnant.  I went for bloodwork prescribed by my OBGYN on 1/18 and 1/20 to measure my HcG levels.  By 1/20-1/21 the bleeding became heavy and my HcG levels dropped.  I had a follow up appointment with my OBGYN on 2/3/2021 where they performed another transvaginal ultrasound and more bloodwork to confirm that I had miscarried.

On 28 Jan 2021, the patient experienced the event of anaphylaxis (life threatening), within 30minutes after the second dose of vaccine. Hence, she received epinephrine and her condition did not improve so received a second dose of the same, also was treated with diphenhydramine and oxygen and sent home. Next day, on 29 Jan 2021, the patient again went into anaphylaxis, hence, received another epinephrine and was also given with prednisone due to which patient got better and was stable today.

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

The fetus was sent to pathology and I was informed that at 12 weeks when I miscarried that the baby had termed at 9 weeks which was the time of my first vaccine injection.

Sunday the pain went from the left side of my neck down to the base of my ribs and then progressed to include the back and chest almost constantly instead of just on inhalation.  I went to the ER on Sunday evening, assuming very bad costochondritis; however, was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in the left lung, areas of possible infarction, and pleurisy.  I had a CT scan at a Medical Center prior to receiving the Moderna vaccine for a suspected PE and it was negative.

She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a nurse (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) in a 37-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 011M20A and 011J20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID) and TOPIRAMATE (TOPAMAX) for an unknown indication.   On 04-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, the patient experienced TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird). On 03-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma) and ASTHENIA (Could not get up). On 04-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg) and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low). At the time of the report, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg), TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia), DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma), CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg), ASTHENIA (Could not get up), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine), HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Haemoglobin: low gram per litre (Low) LOW. In March 2021, Red blood cell count: low cells per microlitre (Low) LOW.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment informations reported were Levalbuterol tartrate  and Rivaroxaba 20 mg   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059897 (Patient Link).

                                                38 year old female - healthy with no significant past medical history. Morning of 1/15/21, pt woke up with difficulty speaking  (would be talking and then unable to articulate words which were replaced by grunting sounds) and tingling to her face. No changes to breathing, no numbness/tingling to extremities, equal facial symmetry. Slow onset of symptoms. Pt went to the ED, where she received a CT, MRI (inconclusive reading), lab work reported as normal per pt, EKG and chest x-ray. Symptoms self resolved while in the ED, however MD staff wanted to admit patient for 24 hours of observation and to complete an echocardiogram. Pt left AMA the evening of 1/15/21 due to resolution of symptoms and wanting to follow up with her cardiologist for the echocardiogram. Pt told by MD staff symptoms were likely caused by either TIA, possible reaction to vaccine or migraine presentation (no report of headaches/auras). Plan was to have patient on blood thinners x 30 days then baby Aspirin thereafter. Pt still needing to follow up with PCP and cardiologist for further work up.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

                                                Received second COVID vaccine Moderna on Wednesday evening at 6pm.  Later that night, I was a little light-headed and achey, but went to bed. On thursday, my legs and arms were extremely achy. I took Tylenol and Motrin in the morning. It seemed to help some, but continued to feel very achy in my legs. I left work early (I am a pediatrician) on Thursday and went home and just sat and rested.  I felt terrible, but had talked to other colleagues who felt very bad that first day after the shot. Friday morning, I woke up still achy but feeling better overall. I took motrin and Tylenol again on Friday morning. I worked the whole day seeing patients. Was tired, but got thru the workday. At around 6pm, I noticed petechiae rash on my lower legs. The rash started spreading thru the night- up my legs and to my arms. I went to ER. They did order CBC, CMP. Platelets were undetectable- 1 platelet was seen under microscope. CMP was normal.  I was told to go to bigger hospital. I went, My platelets read as 4. I was admitted for two nights. Two doses of IVIG were given and I was put on Decadron 40mg PO daily for 4 days. I had tylenol, benadryl, zofran before the IVIG and after.  I will see Hematology next week for follow up. Platelets yesterday at discharge were 60.  Will be checked frequently for the next few months. ITP= diagnosis. COVID shot was trigger.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

                                                I was trying for a pregnancy and was likely pregnant but not detectable at vaccine number 1. Found out about pregnancy a week or so before vaccine 2.  (I was likely about 5 weeks pregnant then based on LMP of dec 22 with avg cycles of 35 days. Decided to get vaccine due to general advice that it is okay during pregnancy. (No known adverse effects). After dose 2, had about 10-12 hours of chills without fever and general fatigue. Shortly afterwards experienced mild cramps. This is my 5th pregnancy and I have no history of complications of any sort. Cramps are not usual for my pregnancies but I know it can be normal so I did not think anything of it. Mild spotting occurred but again did not think anything of it as I know it can be normal. I was scheduled for a first OB visit  Mar 3 where I should have been 10 weeks. (Initial positive pregnancy test was Jan 29). Ultrasound showed empty 5.6 week gestational sac with a yolk sac and subchorionic hemorrhage.   OB suspected pregnancy failure. We followed pregnancy with ultrasound of better quality 10 days later which showed a possible fetal pole and yolk sac but no heart beat and gestational sac measured at 6.0 weeks. Today March 18 awaiting repeat ultrasound tomorrow but started bleeding and cramping. Consistent with the start of the miscarriage. With no histories of abnormal pregnancies and with the gestational  sac consistently measure at 6 weeks (matching to about the time of shot#2), I am inclined to believe that the second covid shot stopped the progression of my pregnancy. I am a huge pro vaccine health care provider but would recommend now an investigation into first trimester covid vaccinations and possibly not recommend this during that time period.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Rhinitis and Sinuplasty. Concomitant products included MACROGOL 3350 (MIRALAX), COLLAGEN, BIOTIN, KERATIN (BIOTIN PLUS KERATIN) and LINACLOTIDE (LINZESS) for an unknown indication.    On 14-Jan-2021 at 1:00 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 14-Jan-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DYSPHAGIA (inability to swallow), TACHYCARDIA (fast heartbeat), DIZZINESS (dizziness), TREMOR (shakiness) and FLUSHING (felt flushed). On 14-Jan-2021, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction), DYSPHAGIA (inability to swallow), TACHYCARDIA (fast heartbeat), DIZZINESS (dizziness), TREMOR (shakiness) and FLUSHING (felt flushed) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In January 2021, Blood pressure measurement: 106/71 (Inconclusive) 106/71.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

Due to a combination of pregnancy (delivered 2/2014) and subsequently two Morena IUDs, I have not even had spotting since 2013.  For three days, I had period-like blood and cramping.  I reported this during my routine rheumatologist appointment who told me to report it here. Additionally, I had pain in the arm for three days as expected from the literature about side effects from the trials.  I am scheduled to have my second dose on 2/4/21 and will report any other side effects.

                                                Pt has h/o HTN (not on medication) and occasional asthma(no hospitalizations), and allergies to Penicillin (tongue swelling), tree nuts (throat swelling), and Bees (local swelling); Pt notes she only takes benadryl for these reactions; she has never been prescribed or used epinephrine. Pt denies heart disease, strokes, diabetes, increased bleeding tendency. No early heart disease in family. LMP in the last week. Pt notes she was supposed to see allergist in past, but has not. Pt was feeling well this morning before she came to COVID vaccine clinic. Pt had received first Moderna Vaccine shortly before 0918am here. At 0938 Pt noted feeling &#34;heaviness&#34; in head and &#34;lump in throat.&#34; Pt denied itching/swelling to mouth, itching/hives to body, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea. No lightheadedness/dizziness. Pt walked to stretcher. BP at right forearm was 223/151 and then 221/132 on repeat. Heartrate in 90s. Sao2 on RA 100%. RR 18. Pt notes having high BPs at times, but not often as high here. Pt speaking is slightly hoarse voice. No strider. Pt speaking in full sentences. No oropharyngeal edema. No urticaria. No tachypnea or wheeze. HRT RRR. 2&#43; left rad pulse.  A/P: given Pt&#39;s h/o severe allergies and now new Globus sensation and change to voice I discussed with Pt that she was likely having allergic reaction. Given involvement of airway I recommended epi administration to neutralize reaction and transfer to ED for observation. I advised Pt that epi would increase heartrate and blood pressure. I determined benefit of treating anaphylaxis outweighed risk of elevating BP, even though she has hypertensive urgency BP values. Pt has some headache; she could be bordering on hypertensive emergency. I asked pharmacist to call 911 indicating early anaphylaxis and request of paramedic.  ~5 minutes after Epi (given at 0942) Pt notes lump sensation and voice improved. I had RN place IV to left AC and gave verbal order for benadryl 25mg IV. Pt notes some nausea and dizziness. Lump sensation continues to improve. EMS arrived ~0950. I gave report to paramedic.  I discussed with Pt that I would place referral to Allergy and Immunology; they will determine if and when Pt could receive second moderna vaccine.

                                                She had pain in the injection site Tuesday night and then during Tuesday she got worse with nausea and some fever.  By Wednesday she was complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year old little girl.

When she came to a few minutes later she knew she passed out but that was it. she did not go with the EMS, another staff member took her to the ER.

I felt like crap afterwards and stayed the full 30 minutes too. I had thought maybe it was anxiety, but I&#39;ve broken out all over in hives and I can barely talk now due to how hoarse my throat is. I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!

                                                Patient began experiencing pain and difficulty walking on Tuesday, March 23. Later that afternoon she was taken to an Urgent care, who sent her to the ER for evaluation. She was diagnosed with a very large blood clot in her leg, spanning from just above the knee to her groin area. They admitted her and began treating her with blood thinners.  While undergoing that treatment, her heart stopped 3 times and she had to be resuscitated. They discovered a pulmonary embolism.  While removing a large clot from her lungs, the doctor found that her lungs were riddled with hundreds of tiny blood clots. They also said that she was bleeding internally, very heavily, from an unknown location. In all, they gave her 20 units of blood, and none of it stayed in her veins. The doctor said it seemed to just disintegrate.  At that point, her brain and organs had begun shutting down and family made the decision to remove her from life support. She passed away Thursday evening, March 25, 2021.
