                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

                                                VACCINE received on Friday 1/15/2021 afternoon; Monday evening 1/18/2021 felt slight chills; early to bed. Tuesday AM awoke with severe &#39;bed-rocking&#39; chills, nausea and fever 100-101 degrees. recommended I go to Hospital ER.  At ER, temperature increased to 102 degrees.  Covid test was negative, but cost X-ray showed reasons to suspect pneumonia. No one suggested I was just suffering acute reaction to vaccine.  Returned home w/ prescription for doxycycline hyclate and request that I return to the ER the next day if I continued to feel ill.  The next morning, 1/19/21, I again awoke with intense, somewhat frightening chills, vomiting and a mild fever.  As instructed I returned to the ER.  Assuming the COVID Test may have been a false negative, a second one was given; it too turned out to be negative, but I remained at the ER and then admitted to Hospital to remain under observation.  Im the hospital the chills, nausea and fever came to an end, but acute headache and utter fatigue lasted until I was released on Jan 22.  My discharge papers indicated no further signs of pneumonia or any other infection; my attending doctor, concluded that my experience was an unusually strong (and delayed) reaction to the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 025LZ0A) intramuscularly in her right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient experienced heart beating very fast and feeling uncomfortable; it lasted for a few hours. She stated it was atrial fibrillation, she had a diagnosis of this, and it only lasted a few hours. The patient also stated that her blood glucose was 150, which was higher than normal.  Treatment for the events was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, increased blood sugar, was considered not resolved. The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and feeling uncomfortable, was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76 year-old female patient with a significant medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and non-serious unexpected events of Discomfort and Blood glucose increased. The events occurred one day (same day) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 025LZ0A. Treatment was not reported. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes were considered strong confounders.

Rapid heart beat followed by afib that was not terminated with normal medications. Dizziness and shortness of breath. Hospitalized with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It resolved after getting two injections of a medication called diltiazem in the emergency department, after which I was monitored overnight in the hospital. Underwent stress test and echocardiogram - results  normal. On the day I write this (March 1) continue to have  shorter periods of rise in blood pressure and heart rate,  diaphragm tightness, insomnia and lethargy.

They put her into a comma with a respirator. Finally went from emergency room to ICU on Monday. Then on Wednesday they took the respirator out and I spoke to her ? told her we all love her and she could only say hoarsely ?terrible, terrible.? They said she might get moved to regular floor. But then Wednesday night couldn?t breathe again and put the respirator back in. Thursday morning husband had it removed and she died that evening at 10:51 on February 25.

I felt dizzy and light headed and had fever of 101F, headache, body aches and I could not get out of bed. I had trouble sleeping. I had trouble concentrating, decrease cognitive abilities and extreme fatigue.  I did take an antihistamine (Xyzal) prior to the vaccine.  I took Tylenol and Zofran  for nausea.  The swelling subsided after  2 days,  and the acute-flu like symptoms lasted about a week. I usually see my doctor every week for weekly injection for my RA .  I still have nausea and he prescribed Zofran for that.   I have small-medium lost my appetite and my taste and smell have change and also itchy eye.  But I have noticed increased saliva excretion.

                                                On April 18 I developed a headache and fever (101), fatigue, tightness/pressure in my throat/esophagus.  Continued through April 20, when I called my GI physician to describe symptoms.  Doctor recommended going to Urgent Care to be tested for COVID 19.   Within an hour or two I went for the test, which was negative.  The attending doctor then ordered EKG, blood tests, and CT scan to see what was going on.  Found high white blood cell count and Pericardial Effusion.  Sent me to hospital, where I was admitted and spent 6 days.  The diagnosis was that the Pericardial Effusion was caused by inflammation, not infection, and I was started on a combination of drugs to eliminate the fluid.  I was released on April 26 with only trace fluid around my heart.

She was hospitalized from 5/26/21-5/31/21 with a complicated urinary tract infection with bacteremia and pyelonephritis due to a pansensitive e coli which progressed to bacteremia and pyelonephritis despite being treated with 10 days of keflex and 3 days of macrobid as an out pt. She also had severe sepsis and a NSTEMI as a result of the illness. It is unclear why she progressed despite appropriate treatment and it was suggested an immune deficiency work up be done if she has recurrence in the future.

                                                Ischemic attack; Severe high blood pressure; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 77-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced severe high blood pressure (BP) and ischemic attack.  The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included atorvastatin calcium, bupropion hydrochloride, gabapentin, ibuprofen, estradiol and metformin.  On 08 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, the patient was taken by ambulance to the hospital with severe high BP. During her hospital stay the patient&#39;s BP readings were 190s/109. The patient was diagnosed with ischemic attack.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital. Her BP readings since then have been 179/85.   On 19 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s BP reading was 145/80.   Treatment for the event included lisinopril.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome of the events, severe high BP and ischemic attack, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 77-year-old female patient with medical history of diabetes who experienced the serious unlisted events of Hypertension and Transient ischaemic attack that required hospitalization. The events occurred approximately four days after receiving their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A), Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. Of note, patient&#39;s elderly age and history of diabetes are considered risk factors for the occurrence of the events.

                                                I woke up the next morning and I was very short of breath much more then usual, by the next day it was even worse and everyday after. By Feb. 10, 2021 I had low fever and difficulty breathing so I went to Urgent Care, after blood work, received chest X-ray, EKG, CT scan. It came back with pneumonia. My biggest quest is can safely take the second one or a different one, with emphysema you need protection. Thank you

                                                The patient had her second Moderna shot on Feb 17, 2021. At 3 am the next morning she reported to the ED c/o being &#34;fluish&#34; and short of breath. She was found to be hypoxic to the upper 80&#39;s on RA, and a CXR was consistent with CHF.  She stated she had some off and on chest pain for the last few weeks, especially with exertion. Ultimately it was found that she had an elevated troponin and was felt to have had an MI. She underwent cardiac cath and a stent was placed in a 95% ostial right coronary stenosis.   Although she was reported as having had a &#34;hyperimmune&#34; response to the vaccine, I can only say for certain she had flash pulmonary edema due to cardiac ischemia that was due to a stenosis in her RCA that had been there for quite some time, but possibly just happened to become critical right after her second COVID vaccine. It would be hard to blame the vaccine, but it is also impossible I guess to absolve it from any role in her MI.

Her SOB was significant enough for her to seek Urgent evaluation on 2/8 then ED evaluation on 2/11 then again on 2/20/2021. she continues to have SOB/DOE even now.  She also has dizziness intermittently.  she had chills initially but no fever until she had transient fever for less than 12 hours 2.5 weeks later likely associated w/ unrelated problem( UTI).  so far no causes found regarding her SOB after numerous tests( see below for tests).

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

I was blind in that eye for about 10 minutes. We drove  right away to my eye doctor, who sent me to the ER. The hospital is Stroke Certified. They admitted me and did a stroke workup. I was in the hospital for 1 day (24 hours) which included overnight.  The treating HCP concluded that I had experienced an ocular stroke. Since it was exactly 4 days after my second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, it most likely was caused by that vaccine.

This spontaneous case was reported by a nurse (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)), ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) and ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty) in a 77-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 025L20A and 042L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Mercury sensitivity (itching, tearing; reacted once), Shellfish allergy (rash) and Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Concomitant products included AMIODARONE from 06-Feb-2021 to an unknown date for Atrial fibrillation, METOPROLOL SUCCINATE (TOPROL XL) and RIVAROXABAN (XARELTO) for an unknown indication.   On 05-Jan-2021 at 1:00 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021 at 4:00 PM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 05-Feb-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 06-Feb-2021, the patient experienced HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heartbeat after cardioversion). On 14-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and FATIGUE (more fatigue). The patient was hospitalized from 14-Feb-2021 to 16-Feb-2021 due to CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE. At the time of the report, CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)) and ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) had resolved and ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty), HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heartbeat after cardioversion) and FATIGUE (more fatigue) had not resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)), ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty), HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heartbeat after cardioversion) and FATIGUE (more fatigue).    The patient was treated with cardioversion on 06-FEB-2021 and IV Lasix.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The CHF was attributed to the use of the amiodarone for aggravated atrial fibrillation. No further follow-up information is expected.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-006529 (E2B Linked Report).

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).   On 26-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 26-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Afib) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (Lightheaded/dizzy), NERVOUSNESS (nervous), DEHYDRATION (Dehydrated), VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (Problems with vision), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), DISTURBANCE IN ATTENTION (Problems concentrations) and FATIGUE (Fatigued/Tired). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Afib), DIZZINESS (Lightheaded/dizzy), NERVOUSNESS (nervous), DEHYDRATION (Dehydrated), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), DISTURBANCE IN ATTENTION (Problems concentrations) and FATIGUE (Fatigued/Tired) outcome was unknown and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (Problems with vision) had not resolved. For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments Treatment included metoprolol, digoxin and diltiazem. No concomitant medication was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, The patient&#39;s advance age may remain a risk factor for the event Atrial fibrillation. Further information has been requested.

Friend reports that patient complained of &#34;just not feeling right&#34; following vaccine administration. Complained of poor sleep, poor appetite, dyspepsia and began complaining of lower extremity swelling in the weeks following vaccine administration. Was no longer able to line-dance, etc. Was fatigued. Her friends became concerned and encouraged her to seek medical attention, patient reported that she had was prescribed &#34;water pill&#34; and told to &#34;lay off salt,&#34;. Friends later found out that she had lied about doctor&#39;s visit and was self-medicating with over the counter  &#34;water pills&#34; for all of the water weight she was gaining. Eventually developed worsening shortness of breath. Admitted to hospital on 5/4 with shortness of breath and worsening abdominal pain. Found to have systolic heart failure (EF 20-30%) and was in SVT. Also diagnosed with UTI and SMV thrombus. Grossly anasarcic on exam. Treated for heart failure with diuretic and for her UTI with antibiotics, was started on Heparin drip for SMV thrombus. Underwent left heart catheterization at OSH that was negative for significant CAD. Developed worsening septic shock and was transferred to our hospital for higher level of care. Unfortunately had ongoing decline, found to be fungemic. Eventually succumbed to her septic shock, passed away on 5/14/21.  Patient had second dose of vaccine on 3/18/21 according to vaccine card in her purse. Friend states that because of symptoms she developed after first dose of vaccine, she was fearful of getting second dose.  Friends insist that she was well before the vaccine---knee pain was limiting factor for her activity level, never shortness of breath. Of note, several friends tested positive for COVID on 2/11/21, the week prior to patient receiving her vaccine. Patient tested negative and reportedly got tested at frequent intervals and was always negative.

                                                She received her vaccine. The next few days, she was extremely tired and slept a lot. A couple days after the vaccine, she complained that her stomach hurt slightly. Days went by and the pain slowly got worse. She didn&#39;t feel like eating. Then on 2/8/21 in the middle of the night, she woke up in excruciating pstomach pain and her husband called ambulance. They rushed her to ER. The determined that her colon had ruptured near her stomach and they took her in for emergency colonoscopy. The surgery was a success, but a couple days after, she was weak and said she didn&#39;t want to fight any longer. They put her on hospice measures and she died 2/15/21. We feel that she was doing fine before the vaccine, and then all of a sudden this occurred. Seems to be too much of a coincidence. Finally taking the time to report it, in case there are others having colon and or stomach issues.

                                                Patient started having stroke like symptoms at approximately 1145am on May 30th.   Pt was having difficulty dressing and generalized feeling of being paralyzed for a brief moment or two.   Pt was also having trouble getting out her words/thoughts.  Pt never had loss of function of her limbs, No weakness, No facial droop, No loss of bowel or bladder control.   Once in ER at Hospital,  pt was found to have irregular heart rhythm e on EKG (Sinus Tachycardia with possible AFib with rate in the 100&#39;s up to 130&#39;s) - CT Scan of Head was negative for bleed or acute ischemia.  By 8pm the same day the pt had improvement of speech and getting out words/thoughts better and by the next day at 10am sounded back to normal self and still with no other neurological deficits.   During that next day we learned that the patient had been to her Primary Care Dr on 5/24/2021 for routine visit when they did an EKG in the office and pt was thought to have an &#34;irregular Heart rhythm&#34; and referred to see a cardiologist.  During course of hospital stay the patient was treated with heart rhythm medications and Eliquis for Diagnosis of Afib/TIA.

                                                Pneumonia in left lung; Pain in neck; Acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her body; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 78 year old female who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body, pneumonia in her left lung and neck pain.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included non specified medication for blood pressure, calming down, dementia and thyroid.   On 04 Jan 2021, approximately 2.5 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 04 Jan 2021, the patient developed acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body that lasted ten days. The patient also experienced neck pain. On an unknown date, she was treated in the emergency room for pneumonia in her left lung and given antibiotics. She later followed up with her primary care doctor and additional x-rays were taken and she was treated with prednisone.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, acute pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body, was considered resolved on 14 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, pain neck was resolved on 19 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, pneumonia in left lung, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Company Comment: This case concerns a 78-year-old female patient who experienced unexpected serious event of pneumonia and non-serious event of acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body and neck pain.  The event developed on the same day after the first dose and only dose of the vaccine mRNA-1273 vaccine (lot # unknown, expiration date-unknown).  Although a temporal association exist between the event of pneumonia and the administration of the vaccine, in the absence of clinical details including diagnostic test, a definite diagnosis was not established. The events of acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body and neck pain are also temporarily associated with vaccine administration and a causal association cannot be excluded. Main field defaults to possibly related&#39; for all events.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Pleasant 78-year-old female with history of lung cancer with remote partial pneumonectomy, some element of COPD and chronic respiratory failure on home oxygen therapy. She presents with worsening shortness of breath, which started rather abruptly the day prior to presentation. On arrival to the ED she was mildly tachypneic and slightly tachycardic and appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. Her O2 had been titrated to 4 L/m nasal cannula in order to sustain SaO2 values in the 90% or above range. Patient also noted to have pallor. No hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, fever, cough or known exposure to COVID. Patient reports having received her first COVID vaccination just over one 1 week ago. A hypochromic microcytic anemia, progressive, was noted with a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Patient reported that she was up-to-date on EGD and colonoscopy within the past year without findings of acute pathology or bleeding. A CTA of the chest was conducted with findings of bilateral pulmonary emboli. She denies lower extremity swelling, pain or tenderness. Patient placed in observation in order to provide palliative blood replacement therapy and commence with anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism.  DISCHARGE SUMMARY/OBSERVATION COURSE: Uneventful observation course for this pleasant 78-year-old female who presented with somewhat sudden worsening of her chronic shortness of breath and was found to have CTA evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli. This in the setting of a progressive iron deficiency anemia without evidence of active clinical gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells in a palliative fashion for her presenting hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Posttransfusion hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dL. Concurrently, she was placed on weight-based low molecular weight heparin for full anticoagulation. I examined the patient on the morning of February 12 and found her to be nondistressed. Her SaO2 value was 96% on 4 L/m nasal cannula O2. Recall that her baseline flow rate historically had been 2 L/m his cannula. Etiology of the patient&#39;s thromboembolism uncertain. She had no clinical findings of unilateral or bilateral lower extremity swelling or tenderness. Patient noted to be a survivor of both breast and lung cancers but without known evidence of active persistent malignancy. Of interest, she had received a COVID-19 vaccine just over one week prior to presentation. I contacted pharmacy in this regard and encouraged him to report possible adverse event via VAERS. I recommended a course of rivaroxaban and provided a prescription with a VTE dosing schedule. Patient was advised to followup with Dr in 10 days.  M.D., Hospital Medicine    MD Feb 12, 2021 08:40

                                                Admitted to hospital for acute on chronic respiratory failure following covid vaccination.  (patient significantly fatigued, slept most of the day after vaccine, not on BIPAP as needed)  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  patient is a 78 y.o. female with a history of oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and persistent atrial fibrillation who presents today with general malaise.  She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study. Patient is diuresing and will likely be able to discharge tomorrow.

                                                Stroke following administration; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 78 year old ,female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced a stroke/cerebrovascular accident.  The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as previous stroke two years ago. Concomitant medications taken by the patient included losartan, glipizide, lintas, metformin, blood thinners, hydrochlorothiazide.   On 26 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 023M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Feb 2021, the patient experienced a stroke which needed emergency treatment. She received treatment for this condition and was back at home at the time of reporting and at that point she had no other side effects.  Treatment activities for event was received but not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The outcome of event, stroke  was recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s elderly age along with prior history of stroke are considered significant risk factors.

                                                Patient states she received first COVID vaccination approximately one week ago (not a great historian); she tells me about 4 days later she became shorth of breath that progressively worsened - especially with exertion.  She went to ER and was sent home on steroids and antibiotics.  Shortness of breath became worsened so she presented back to ER and CTA was performed.  There is no evidence of PE but patient has what looks to be a chronic DVT of left subclavian vein extending up to IJ junction.  I do not believe this is for sure vaccine related but felt it was important to report it anyway.  She cannot tell me why she takes warfarin at home but I do assume it is for this known chronic DVT.  Unsure of Vaccine brand name.  Most vaccines in this area have been Moderna.

Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension (patient reported hypertension as one of the health issues that she has.).   On 24-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 21-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY ARREST (Respiratory arrest and was out) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), DYSPNOEA (Diaphragmatic breathing (could not breathe) was on vent mask that delivered oxygen) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COUGH (Cough that felt like coming from another human being) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt crappy) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ERYTHEMA (Covid red arm) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CHILLS (Intermittent Chills) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, RESPIRATORY ARREST (Respiratory arrest and was out), DYSPNOEA (Diaphragmatic breathing (could not breathe) was on vent mask that delivered oxygen), COUGH (Cough that felt like coming from another human being), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt crappy) and ERYTHEMA (Covid red arm) outcome was unknown and CHILLS (Intermittent Chills) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In February 2021, Erythema: (abnormal) (big - diameter 3.5 X 6 inches). In February 2021, White blood cell count: 15.5 (High) Her white blood cells were 15.5. In February 2021, X-ray abnormal: (abnormal) lung X-rays were horrible and was &#34;tanked&#34; due to all the diaphragmatic breathing (could not breathe).     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient received treatment with 3 antibiotics, steroids and oxygen. Patient reported that they wanted to intubate her and ativan was pushed by RN. Patient was on &#34;vent mask&#34; that delivered oxygen and was in cardiac intensive unit for 4 days and then the doctor decided it was not covid or pneumonia and were looking at cardiac issues.They had to give Narcan to reverse the effects of Ativan. Patient stated in the call that Moderna pushed her off the end of the cliff and reports that prior to this she was healthy and walked daily on regular basis.  Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                I had tender areas on the inside of my left leg starting about mid or late March in the upper thigh region and some aching in the inner aspect of the calf portion of the leg. This became worse over the Easter weekend and I went to  clinic on April 6, 2021. I had a superficial blood clot just above the knee on the inner aspect of my left leg. After that appointment the redness and soreness and very hard feeling of the veins extended up my leg 8 to 10 inches. I did not have a blood clots in the deep veins. I have had some varicose vein?s  and surgery for such about five years ago. The clinic did not say the clot was due to the vaccine but I had no injuries, no recent surgeries and nothing unusual that would have caused the clot other than the vaccine

Second Moderna vaccine on 3/6/2021, admitted on 3/31/2021.    4/18 IM Progress NOTE states: #Limbic encephalitis, improving. Treating for Listeria given inflammatory findings in addition to lymphocytic CSF and few gram-positive cocci on stain. CSF paraneoplastic antibodies are negative therefore anticipating that the serum antibodies will also come back negative Depressed flat affect consistent with limbic inflammation -improving Repeat MRI 4/14 shows improvement Ampicillin, tentative plan for 4 to 8 week course for possible listeriosis Gentamicin, completed 1 week course 4/15. Continues on Keppra                                                                                                        4/20 Neurology Progress NOTE: Impression - Meningoencephalitis, presumed to be secondary to listeria.                                                                                                              4/27 ID progress NOTE : Patient found to have limbic encephalitis and possible infectious cerebritis.  CSF exam, was performed after about 2.5 days of antibiotics due to patient anticoagulation, showed 27 white blood cells, 96% lymphocytes; protein 146, glucose 69.  Meningitis encephalitis PCR panel negative.  Gram stain with rare intracellular GPC&#39;s, culture negative. Per micro lab, 2 different techs each visualized 2 different fields with an intracellular GPC.  Clinical picture was thought compatible with Listeria (which is a bacillus, but could be mistaken for a coccus).  Completed 10 days of empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone on 4/10.  was on ampicillin CNS dosing, plus gentamicin for synergy started 4/9, now off of gentamicin.  Ampicillin changed to meropenem due to drug eruptions.  Continued slow clinical improvement; repeat MRI brain 4/13 showed radiographic improvement.  Noted to have negative coccidioides serology but not titre came back at 1:8, repeat titre negative.  Repeat LP shows similar findings with 28 WBCs, with lymphocytic predominant, slightly low glucose and elevated protein.  Awaiting Coccidioides CSF and fungal cultures.  Continue fluconazole 400 mg daily, renally adjusted.  No evidence of QTc prolongation.  Continue to monitor rash. No evidence of DRESS, TENS or SJS. Patient has eosinophiluria.  Continue current plan of care.  Diagnosis:  -Limbic encephalitis  -Positive coccidioides titre of 1:8  -Possible infectious cerebritis  -Rash and pruritus - improving.  -Breast cancer in remission s/p mastectomy, radiation, chemotherapy  -Atrial fibrillation with RVR  -AKI with eosinophiluria Discharged on 4/27/21

                                                My mom, got her first Moderna shot on Feb. 4th, 2021 and developed trombosis in the legs about a week later.  She went to the doctor, who at first didn&#39;t want to see her and told her to elevate her leg. Pt. had a scheduled eye appointment on Feb. 12th  with an other doctor and when she asked if she had any other issues, pt. showed her her leg.  The eye doctor immediately told her to go to urgent care.  When she did she received blood thinners and started injections in her stomach for 5 days.  Feb. 18th pt. suffered a mini stroke and went to the hospital emergency room.  She was transferred over to another facility in the afternoon and kept overnight.  She had a phone appointment with the Dr. on Feb. 24th and on the 26th she received a heart monitor to wear for 2 weeks.  She also had a check up about her leg, which was still swollen.   On March 4, pt. received her second Moderna shot and she was feverish and very tired for days and weeks after.  By March 18th her condition didn&#39;t improve at all and in fact she was felling really bad over night, so on March 19th she was admitted again to the hospital.  She was  monitored and kept over night, but  during the early morning she suffered a stroke and a heart attack and passed way the next day.

                                                I happened to counsel patient&#39;s husband about his prescription 2 days ago and hear that his wife died of stroke approximately a month after the second dose of  Moderna vaccine. I could not ask him further about exact date when she was admitted at the hospital because he was sick. I am not sure whether moderna vaccine caused her stroke, or not.  Her husband said his wife had high blood pressure.  They got Moderna vaccine on the same date.  Her husband  thought her high blood pressure caused the stroke. I don&#39;t have any info about  her medical progress at the hospital.

                                                On the 19th of March, one day after the two week period after the second shot, my heart began to race and my breathing became difficult. My husband took me to the ER and at that time the doctors were unable to find the problem. After several ER visits, visit with neuro due to a nerve problem that came along with the heart and breathing problems , my primary care doctor finally suggested an ultra sound be conducted due to the extreme leg/thigh pain that had made it impossible for me to walk. The results of the ultra sound indicated severe extreme multiple blood clots.  At this point, I had become wheel chair bound. The nerve injury was pinching on the optcitical nerve which has now caused my vision to be impaired; my vision is no longer sharp (blurred vision). At this point, I can only walk a few feet without the assistance of a wheel chair or some other support. My thighs remain huge/swolllen. I continue experience leg/thigh pain. The nerve injury in the left side of my brain seems to be causing some crippling of my right hand which is my dominant side.

                                                Patient came with husband to Vaccine clinic today 3/5 for 2nd dose of vaccine. Did well during and immediately after vaccine. Husband states patient has c/o severe chest pressure and pain for several weeks but has refused to come to ER for evaluation. Today, after getting vaccine dose and going to local bank, patient was in passenger side of truck when chest pain started again. Husband begged patient to let him take her to the ER but she said no, I?m fine and I don?t want to go. She then went unresponsive. At a stop light, he was next to a couple of cops who he was able to wave down and proceed to escort them in to ER. Upon arrival to the ER, patient was unresponsive and pulseless. CPR was initiated, 1 defib, and 1mg of epi was given. Return of pulse was obtained, but husband asked for no life support and only comfort measures. Patient was admitted for comfort measures.  I do NOT think this was related to her vaccine, but rather the unfortunately end to a sub-acute chest pain patient that declined multiple urgings to seek care.  Patient then expired on 3/5/21 at 2037.

                                                5. Brief History and Hospital Course:  Patient is a/an 79 y.o. female with a past history significant for HTN, HLD, and DM who presented to facility on 3/9/2021 with complaints of severe 8/10 right jaw pain lasting 3 minutes. EKG with new left BBB and troponin mildly elevated 8-17-35-26. She was seen by Cardiology and determined to have NSTEMI and taken for cardiac cath with drug eluting stent placed to LAD. Echo was also ordered with evidence of murmur. Cavity size is normal. Wall thickness is normal. Systolic function is normal. The estimated ejection fraction is 55%. Dyssynchronous interventricular septal motion, likely related to conduction abnormality/bundle branch block. Grade I diastolic dysfunction. Annulus is severely calcified. Severely calcified and restricted opening of posterior mitral leaflet. Mild mitral valve stenosis at the max.  She remained stable post stent placement. She remained on dual antiplatelet therapy

                                                shortness of breath, pain in chest increasingly more severe as time went on. Noticed shortness of breath about 12 days after the vaccine was given. I am a 2 mile a day walker and very healthy. It was below freezing and I attributed the shortness of breath to weather. I went to an ER on March 8, 2021  after realizing symptoms were worse. I was admitted with Pulmonary embolism in both lungs and pneumonia in both lungs. The hospitalist could  not give me a reason why this happened. He encouraged me to report this incident. You would need to contact him for tests and such. I am a patient. I live where medical help is limited. The vaccine was administered at a clinic but the ER I went to was a different system.

                                                Fatigue; dizziness, light-headedness; repeated episodes of atrial fibrillation and heart rate ranging between 37 and 180; nausea; repeated sensation that I might pass out.  These symptoms began on 2/23/21, 5 days after receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine. Symptoms were similar to but more intense than symptoms experienced after my 1st Moderna vaccine. I was taken to the ER during the night of 02/24/2021 beause of intensification of symptoms.  Symptoms continued intermittently until 03/23/202 when a cardiac ablation was performed at a Cardiovascular Center.  I also experienced some post-op Afib in first 2 weeks following the procedure.

                                                Fatigue; dizziness; light-headedness; repeated episodes of atrial fibrillation and vascillation between low and high heart rates (ranging between 42 and 130 BPM)  These symptoms began 2 days after I received the 1st Moderna vaccine and lasted approx. 7 days.  Though I was diagnosed with Afib 10 years ago, my prior experience with Affib was limited to 3-4 isolated episodes per year, lasting only 1-3 hours each.  My past Afib experiences were never as long or as intense as this experience.  It is not clear whether this worsening Afib experience simply coincided with my Covid vaccination or whether there may have been a causal relationship.

Treatment team Severe sepsis (CMS/HCC) Principal problem Discharge Summary Internal Medicine    Inpatient DeathSummary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admission Date: 4/6/2021     Discharge Date: 4/17/2021  DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Patient is an 79 y.o. female morbidly obese with past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia follow-up that was initially scheduled oncology follow-up for April 7 now postponed to the next 2 weeks, COPD on 2 L oxygen support at home, GERD, depression and anxiety.  She was recently seen in the ED on April 4, 2021 with complaint of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever, chills, nonbloody diarrhea, vomiting and weakness and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.  She had however received a second dose of COVID-19 a week before and was  discharged home due to lack of significant findings on imaging chest x-ray and lack of requirement for higher  oxygen support. She presented to the emergency via EMS for evaluation of progressive shortness of breath with associated with fever, chills, headache, persistent shortness of breath, cough productive of thick clear sputum, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She denies abdominal pain, chest pain, or dizziness.  Denies recent antibiotic usage or recent travel.  Apparently, she thought she was getting better upon discharge after being kept for about 12 hours in the last ED visit, however she was not feeling well after going to bed last night and asked the husband to call 911.  Upon EMS arrival patient was saturating in the 80s and in respiratory distress.  She received 1 DuoNeb and was eventually placed on 10 L oxygen support.  She was noted to be in significant respiratory distress during speech.   Hospital Course Patient was admitted to hospital due to shortness of breath, and was found to have severe sepsis on presentation due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She had evidence of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure as well.  She was started on IV antibiotics, as well as remdesivir and Decadron at high dose.   Unfortunately she continued to have clinical deterioration, and ultimately required high flow oxygen therapy.  She was then transferred to the ICU, and ultimately required intubation due to severe profound ongoing hypoxia despite optimal medical treatment.  She did not respond to remdesivir or steroids or antibiotics.  Post intubation, she also developed acute renal failure during the course of her admission.   Multiple discussions were had throughout the hospitalization regarding goals of care, and initially patient and family wish to be continually aggressive.  She received full medical treatment, including life support, with minimal improvement.  Despite being on ventilator for roughly 5 days, she continued to have severe hypoxia.  She was proned, and was unable to sustain oxygen saturations when supine even for short period.   Her renal function continued to decline as well, and at that point discussion was had with family regarding goals of care again.  They were explained that symptoms continue to be persistent, and her illness continues to progress despite aggressive medical therapy.  Ultimately decision was made to not pursue dialysis, and to allow the patient to be kept comfortable and pass away naturally from this infection.   She was terminally extubated on 4/17 and passed away at 11:16 AM due to COVID-19 and acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.

We left the facility and on the way home, approximately 45 after she received the vaccine, she began slurring her words ands was confused. The slurring lasted for 2-3 minutes The confusion continued. I brought her the ER where she was immediately taken in for  a CT Scan. She later had an MRI, and met with a Cardiologist. She later had an EEG at the request of a Neurologist. She spent three nights in the hospital.  All tests showed no acute signs of stroke, etc.

Staff cannot answer what caused the seizure though they found a 4mm bleed on her brain; believed unrelated to seizure; on an MRI.  My mother has never had a seizure and noone in my family have had seizures.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the vaccine but felt it should be reported to you.

                                                Pneumonia with collapsed lung; Pneumonia with collapsed lung; Scheduled to take 2nd dose of vaccine on 26 Mar 2021, 6 weeks after; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 80-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced pneumonia with collapsed lung/pneumonia and scheduled to take second dose of vaccine on 26 Mar 2021/inappropriate schedule of vaccine administration.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided by the reporter. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 61016308) in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Mar 2021, the patient experienced pneumonia with collapsed lung and was hospitalized.  She was scheduled to take second dose of vaccine on 26 Mar 2021.  Treatment for the event included hospitalization for pneumonia with collapsed lung.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, pneumonia with collapsed lung was unknown.  The outcome of the event, inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered was considered to be resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 80-year-old who had second dose scheduled 6 weeks after first dose (inappropriate schedule of product administration) and also experienced collapsed lung/pneumonia. Although a temporal association exist, based on the information provided, the event of collapsed lung/pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related.  Pneumonia is due to an infective etiology.  The event of inappropriate schedule of product administration is assessed as not applicable.

                                                My mom received her second covid shot at 10:05 AM on 3/26 and experienced no adverse symptoms. At around 6 am the following day, on the morning of 3/27 she was found on the floor, and presumably suffered from a heart attack. After devastation to our family, we called her physician and he himself was also surprised. Although she is a type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure she has maintained great health and kept her conditions under control with her medications. This, unfortunately, seems too coincidental to not have been in some way or completely caused by the second dose of the shot.

Pt started exhibiting spontaneous bruising and petechia without external causes of trauma.  Days later patient started exhibiting signs of confusion and sluggishness and complaining of headache.   On post vaccination day 21 patient taken to ER where platelets found to be 18 and CT scan showed a subdural hematoma.     patient continues to be hospitalized and workup is underway to determine cause. My belief is the severe thrombocytopenia is related to the vaccine.

                                                Severe thrombocytopenia developing 1 week after 1st Moderna vaccine. Pt got first vaccine April 12 or 14 (she can&#39;t remember which) and is due for her next May 10 or 12 (though she is not getting this dose per Hem/onc note). Plt down to 3K (from 258K on 3/29/21). This has required 2 hospitalizations with multiple transfusions, bone marrow bx, high levels O2. She is currently in the hospital and her oncologist noted on 5/4/21: &#34;this is covid vaccine related until proven otherwise (she got her 1st Moderna shot one week before plts plummeted); would not get 2nd dose; should be reported to VAERS.&#34;

No official diagnosis, treat as  ITP.   Follow up visits with oncologist/haematologist to keep an eye on platelets as they increase.   March 30-Apr 4 - ER visit due to swelling of ankles, feet, and left arm. Tests show superficial blood clot, fluid on lungs, and pneumonia. Oncologist said that &#34;we have no official diagnosis&#34;, that she&#39;s being treated for ITP.   April 6-14 - follow up visit to oncologist/haematologist show elevated kidney enzymes, then later liver enzymes,  low sodium.   April 14 - decision to move to short term rehab for regular PT and OT. Continued swelling (fluid in third spaces.)   April 21 - visit to cardiologist to perform cardioversion, successful (during first week of hospital stay, heart rhythm med had to stop).   April 23 - facility nurse discovered significantly low Hemoglobin and a blood transfusion was ordered.    April 24 - returned to short term rehab facility.   April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to &#34;get it out of her system.&#34; Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

Of course he gave it to me, so the 02/01/2021 he tested positive and then he had the antibody infusions and a couple of days later I tested positive and I had the infusions on 02/05/2021. About 2 weeks later I got very sick, back ache and chest pains so I went to the ER so I ended up with blood cots in my lungs. They did scans and tons of blood tests, heart scan, lung scans. I have been on blood thinners since them. After Covid and everything I had me second dose this past Friday. So far I am doing okay, I am feeling a little bit dizzy.

                                                Had a stroke; A spontaneous report was received from a caregiver concerning an 81-years-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine and had a stroke.  Patient&#39;s medical history included a mini stroke (5-6 years ago). Concomitant medication included blood thinners.  On 02 Feb 2021 at 4:30 pm, ten days prior to onset of the event stroke, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot/batch: unknown) for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient had an event of stroke for which was hospitalized. The patient was on a lot of medications (not specified).   Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not recorded.  The outcome of the event stroke was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of stroke, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s elderly age and prior history of TIA are considered as risk factors.

                                                Within 24 hours, my mom&#39;s arms swelled up from shoulder to fingertips and she had never had swelling in her arms prior. She also was hanging her head as if she had fallen asleep, but actually was unable to lift her head. 4 days following the vaccine she started having breathing issues and was intubated, we had the ventilator removed  (she was actually a DNR and was not supposed to be intubated).  On January 19, 2021 she died. She went into this facility for rehab regarding an infection she had in her leg.

                                                I video chatted with her Thursday after receiving the vaccine. My mom was in poor health but she was talking in complete sentences and responded appropriately. She was upright in bed and made eye contact. She smiled and denied pain. By Sunday, she was extremely weak and unable to sip water with a straw. Her health had changed dramatically and rapidly. She moaned in pain and was very fatigued. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the week and she stopped talking and was constantly sleeping. They started antibiotics for the oozing cancer lesion and then morphine for pain and end of life care. She passed away on January 22nd which was 15 days post vaccination.

                                                Patient reported feeling weak, fatigue, fever (102), and loss of appetite. Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

I (foolishly) did not do anything but suffered through these symptoms at varying degrees of pain/discomfort for about an hour and a half.  Recently on 4/9/21, I experienced these same symptoms.  My heart felt like it was pounding out of my chest; pulse rate was up to 170 and BP was 190/86.  I also had intermittent chest pains at different levels of severity.   Called 911, ambulance took me to healthcare facility where I was advised that I had Atrial Fibrillation.  I don&#39;t know if this is related to the Covid shots but I feel it should be documented.  While I have had high blood pressure for years and I am an older adult, I have never had any heart problems, per se.  I also know it would not be unusual for someone with my characteristics to develop- Atrisl Fibrillation, however, it is suspicious that this occurred only after the covid vaccines were administered.

                                                Started feeling weak next day after shot.  As days went by I became increasingly short of breath.  This continued for over 2 weeks and then started having chest pain.  Went to ER and admitted with pericarditis.  2 days later I went into Atrial fib.  The next day I had a cardioversion.  Home the following day.  One week at home not feeling well, I was readmitted with increased chest pain and shortness of breath.  Pulse very low and needed a pacemaker which was inserted Easter Sunday.  Home now and still not feeling well.

                                                My mother suffered a massive stroke 40 days after receiving the 2nd dose of the cover 19 vaccine. She fell sick the day after the injection and suffered with brain fog, memory issues, lethargy from that day forward. On day 36 after the 2nd dose she developed a debilitating stomach issue that cause explosive diarrhea that lasted 4 days/nights. This bout with stomach issues left her extremely weak and exhausted. On the 4th night of the diarrhea she got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and couldn&#39;t lift herself off of the commode. It took two hours for her to call for help. Once admitted to the ER the stroke was confirmed. Because they could not pinpoint the first stroke symptom she was not eligible for the life saving blood thinning meds and suffered complete paralysis of her right side.

She defied covid for over a year, despite living in an assisted living facility in one of 2020&#39;s &#34;hot zones&#34;.  After taking the vaccine, she died within 2 months.  I definitely believe 100% the vaccine in the very least hastened her health as she began declining immediately after the first dose, with on/off flu like symptoms until her death.

                                                Within two weeks following second covid shot, my mother developed extreme pulmonary issues with lungs that presented a &#34;ground glass&#34; appearance. Shortly thereafter, she was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease despite having never been a smoker or exposed to asbestos.  While her medical doctor does not believe there is a connection, in the 8-10 weeks following the initial event she is improving significantly.  It took three hospital stays, a lung biopsy, a pulmonary embolism and lengthy time in the ICU but she is starting to improve to the point that she does not need oxygen. The level of improvement she is showing and the rate of improvement seems inconsistent with ILD.

When asked what her sx were, she stated fatigue.  She was well the night of the shot, Thur. and Fri. but became tired on Sat. and Sun.  I went through other sx with her such as h/a, fever, n/v, muscle aches, weakness and she said she experienced none of those.  I questioned her about eating and drinking and she said she ate and drank water.  She seemed fine so I told her to call her doctor if she was worse or the fatigue persisted or call 911.  She agreed.  Two staff from clinic called her Mon. and Tues, (1/18 and 1/19).  On Tues. she may have had sl slurred speech.  She was found deceased on

It did not itch and she is not sure the onset except that it appeared sometime after her Moderna vaccine (only had one shot).  She ended up at Emergency Department per her doctor&#39;s orders and was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia (platelets 130).  They also found stage three kidney failure. She was not aware of these conditions prior to vaccine although it sounds like there were prior labs suggesting some issues.  She was advised to not get the second vaccine as it could potentially further lower platelets.  Apparently, other pts have been in their hospital with severe platelet issue post second Moderna vaccine.

Decided to take a warm bath at about 6pm. Was found dead in bathtub at approximately 7pm with blisters on arms, legs, and face.

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

I am not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but the rapid antigen for Sars-CoV2 was positive and the PCR was negative.  I am reporting this event because of the lack of clarity on this issue and the positivity of the Sars-CoV2 was beyond the parameters of 14 days in the phase three trials.

                                                Diarrhea; A-afib; A spontaneous report was received from an 83-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced diarrhea followed by exacerbation of her A-fib (atrial fibrillation).    The patient&#39;s medical history included hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 25-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number 011M20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01-Feb-2021 (reported a week later), the patient experienced persistent diarrhea.  She stated, &#34;I believe it&#39;s affecting my heart&#34; and that &#34;she went into A-fib since having diarrhea.&#34;      Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The events of diarrhea and atrial fibrillation were not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

We called 911 right away but, by the time EMS arrived, she was unconscious and didn&#39;t appear to be breathing. Patient was not sick at the time this occurred but she was hospitalized in December of 2019 and was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension which required her to go home with and continue on supplemental oxygen. However, she never experienced pulmonary distress after coming home and her SPO2 levels consistently ranged between 96 and 99% with supplemental oxygen. Patient&#39;s death was very sudden and unexpected.

She mentioned chest pain and an ambulance was called.  Following her vaccinations she was very confused and had fallen in the kitchen the Thursday (22nd) prior to her heart attack.   They took her to ER noted she was in shock and had very low blood pressure enroute to hospital.  Her pulse was very low.  She was life flighted to the medical center.  It was determined a blood clot had blocked a major artery into the right side of her heart and it was removed and a stent was placed.  She remained at hospital 3 nights and was transferred to nursing home for recovery and therapy where she currently is being assessed for mental issues and is on 4 different heart medications to control blood pressure and prevent future heart attacks.  There is not a family history of heart issues. Pt was very healthy in spite of being 83 years old.

I was not ill before I had the vaccine.  I only know that after my reaction to the second Moderna Vaccine, I had side effects and never felt well after the vaccine.  My bloodwork done for my Wellness Checkup showed low platelet and as time went by my white count went higher and higher above normal.  Weekly bloodwork and testing of my blood showed that &#34;something&#34; caused my platelets to fight, thus dropping my count to  a low of 21.  What caused the platelets to attack?  We will never know.  Now, with all the study done by my Oncologist, I am beginning to heal.  It all started after my Moderna Vaccine.  Do you think that the vaccine may have caused my health issues?

I am led to believe she spent 2 days on her homes floor between those 2 dates. She has been in a nursing and rehab facility since April 20th and not getting much better. I am convinced that the shot could have put her where she is today. Her insurance ran out early may and this care is costing her money per day with no end in sight. She was an extremely independent woman who lived alone before this happened. Please contact me for more info . This warrants an investigation.

                                                The decedent is an 83 year-old woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion).  She was a former smoker and her past surgical history includes treatment for varicose veins.  Per the off campus request form her medical history also includes congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, seasonal allergies, and allergic reactions to multiple medications, right lower leg ulcer, and generalized decreased energy and chills following Moderna COVID vaccine received at Medical Center (first dose was on 04/22/2021 and final dose was on 05/20/2021).  A clinical note from 03/05/2021 at Medical Center also indicates that she had fevers and chills at that time, possibly due to left lower extremity cellulitis. She was last seen alive in bed around 4:00 on 05/26/2021 by her son who spoke to her as he left for work.  He returned home around 16:30 and found her unresponsive on the living room floor, 911 was called.  Date and time of death was 05/26/2021 at 16:13.     The family requested an autopsy to assess whether the vaccine could have contributed to the death.  Autopsy was notable for hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease which was the likely cause of death.  However, autopsy also revealed and acute and organizing fibrinous pericarditis, of uncertain etiology, possibly vaccine-related.    No cause of the pericarditis was apparent at autopsy.  No evidence of recent myocardial infarction.  Postmortem tryptase was also elevated (57 ng/ml).    This case is being reported to VAERS as a possible case of Moderna vaccine-associated pericarditis in an elderly person.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had no pain or soreness, but the area was a little tender if you pushed, and she waited one hour in the hospital afterwards.  As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again. Consent given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, area was a little tender and had some bruising near eye, were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 84 year old female patient with medical history including atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history). Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension.   On 28-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 25-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 20-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficult breathing) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 27-Feb-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood clot in lung) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and PYREXIA (fever). At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood clot in lung), DYSPNOEA (Difficult breathing) and PYREXIA (fever) outcome was unknown.            Treatment details included Heparin, Xarelto.  Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, and with reoccurrence of blood clot with second vaccine use, causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.

On March 10th, she suffered a blood clot in her eye that caused the eye to lose vision.  Her eye doctor said she is now permanently legally blind in that eye....  I do not know if the blood clot was caused by the vaccine, but I am reporting it in case there is a correlation.

                                                Four days post-vaccination, she had a serious spell with a hiatal hernia which resulted in a possible gastric volvulus. Over the course of the episode, she ended up aspirating while vomiting. Within 24 hours she couldn&#39;t hold her O2 sats at an acceptable level and was put on a ventilator in ICU. She recovered enough to extubate and go to a regular room but then ended up back on the vent and in ICU a second time. She was extubated again, but still could not maintain her O2 levels without medical intervention. She passed away on April 3, 2021. She did have covid-19 in late November 2020, with a mild case of pneumonia. She had been under the care of her primary doctor, as well as home health care and physical therapy, as part of her recovery.  Her death may have been unrelated to the vaccine, but I have been told I should report anyway, as a precaution.

By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

                                                Within a few days, my mother started reporting profound fatigue and shortness of breath while conducting routine household activities. She no longer had to energy for her daily exercise walks and became increasingly lethargic. She died in her sleep while taking an afternoon nap on Thursday, February 4th. I am highly concerned this could be a vaccine related.

I talked with the husband briefly about why his wife was hospitalized. He reported she got sick 2 days after getting her first COVID-19 vaccine. He states she had pneumonia, had a urinary tract infection and had to have a heart catherization with stent placement. We moved her second vaccine appointment to February 17th. The spouse came in on February 8th for his 2nd dose. He told me the doctors did not believe his wife&#39;s hospitalization was related to the first COVID vaccine and he said the doctor&#39;s told him that she needed her 2nd dose.

The pt reported 2 episodes of SOB and lightheadedness, with the second one as the more severe. On her second episode, she felt severe shortness of breath, tried to walk quickly to her bed with her walker, and fell into her bed. CT angio demonstrated acute saddle PE, mild right heart strain, RUL pulmonary infarct, and mild multifocal pneumonia with suspicion of COVID; IR was consulted and suggested thrombectomy due to the severity of the embolism. In the ED, she was started on heparin drip and put on low-flow NC oxygen without distress. Upon arrival to the emergency department her vital signs were significant for T 36.4, SBP 120/81, HR 95 bpm, NSR, RR 18, FiO2 94% on room air.  Her oxygen increased to 98% on 2 L nasal cannula.  Her laboratory values revealed WBCs 15.1, Hb 14.4, HCT 43.4, PLT 321, neutrophils 68.8%, D-dimer 4642, NA 134, K3.4, anion gap 9, BUN 17, creatinine 1.00, glucose 163, troponin elevated 0.12, 0.25, and 0.41, urinalysis is unremarkable, COVID-19 swab is positive. A thrombectomy was performed 2/16/2021.  She tested COVID positive on 2/16/2021 and her SpO2 remains in the high 90s with dips to mid 80s while talking, but she does not currently experience any SOB.

                                                I woke up on 3/02/21 totally incontinent.  I could not control my urine.  The flow was bright red, filled with blood.  I called my healthcare provider and the doctor at that clinic gave me a urine test.  He found nothing.  There was no pain, only blood for about six bouts of irination.  He sent out to a clinic and they said I had an infection caused by E-coli.  (The vaccine had obvioiusly lowered my resistance to infection because I had none before at all.)  Also, he found that I was in heart failure - about 30% function.  They recommended I be hospitalized.  My daughter and I drove back to my home state and primary care physician, who concurred.  I was hospitalized for heart failure at the hospital in my home state.    This was the first time ever my heart had been compromised.  I have now to see a cardiologist, take meds, and do cardio rehab.  They found my heart was enlarged and I had fluid build-up around my heart also.

Was not given TPA in the ER as was out of the window and is on eliquis chronically for past hx of RLE Dvt and partially occluded IVC as a resulted of a complication she suffered from a kyphoplasty procedure in 2017. She has no hx of atrial fibrillation or clotting disorder and has been compliant with her eliquis per the pt and spouse. She does not smoke, her aic is 5.2 and her ldl is 101. Her echo showed no ventricular thrombus and was a neg bubble study with nl EF. she was transferred to a higher level of care for possible neurovascular intervention. She did not ultimately require neurovascular intervention and Her acute ischemia was presumably due to artery to artery embolus causing left ICA thrombus and was not felt to be an eliquiss failure and she was discharged home on 6/17. she was also found to have a klebsiella uti and was sent home on oral antibiotics.    covid 19 neg

                                                Patient went to have labs done for her leukemia checkup 3/24. Patient has had leukemia for many years and has had many blood draws. Patient had blood taken at her appointment and was waiting when the nurse came back out and said her blood had clotted so they needed to redraw her blood. She states this has never happened before and wondered if her blood clotting would have been due to her covid vaccine the week prior. She states the first girl who drew her blood was slower than the second time around when a different nurse drew her blood.

She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.  She flat lined at the hospital and her body went into shock.  She ended up having Kidney, Heart and Liver Failure.  She was still driving and doing all of her cooking, banking, shopping, showering, walking every day on Feb 18th.  She died on March 5th.

She did not have any reaction at all until she woke up 13 days later on 3/5/2021 and her left eye was blind.  She had some sort of blob that changes colors and moves around.  It sometimes is orange.  She knew she did not have macular degeneration as it centers it.  Sometimes it sparkles and has grain to it.  He said that she had an arterial blood, and that leaked from the carotid artery into the eye has not completely sealed off.  She can see out of the right eye perfectly, but she cannot see a little out of the left eye.  If she&#39;s watching the TV she can see the top of the newscasters hair, but she cannot see anything below that.  Her vision is upward either, can see out of either side, but cannot below horizontal down.  He told her that it was basically a stroke that didn&#39;t reach her brain and went to her eye.  He told her to return to see him (ophthalmologist) on 5/18/21 at 10:00 AM.  She also is to see her PCP on 5/20/21.

It was likely she had sudden death as she did not activate her neck alert or call button in her apartment.  Family request we report the incident, she was last seen on 12/15/2020 for pacemaker check, she also had medical message communication with me on 2/8 to request refill on her Percocet that she takes occ for her joint pain only at bed time.  family suspect possible DVT with PE after getting more informed about vaccine side effects. however no autopsy was done.

Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time. Please see MDM section and the rest of the note for further information on patient assessment and treatment.
