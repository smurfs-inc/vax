                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

Critical care was necessary to treat or prevent imminent or life-threatening deterioration of the following conditions: cardiac failure, circulatory failure, CNS failure or compromise, dehydration, hepatic failure, endocrine crisis, metabolic crisis, renal failure, sepsis, respiratory failure, shock, toxidrome and trauma.  I provided critical care services requiring my management in the following manner: chart data review, documentation time, medication orders and management, re-evaluations, vital signs assessments and reviewing monitor data, and ordering and reviewing lab tests.  Aggregate Critical care time was 30 minutes.  My time did not include minutes spent treating any other patient simultaneously or on activities that did not directly contribute to the patient&#39;s treatment.  It did not include time spent performing other reported procedures.  Medical Decision Making:  This is a 76-year-old female who presented ER today for evaluation of syncope.  Patient was reportedly mildly hypotensive which improved with IV fluids.  I suspect that patient had dehydration given 4 episodes of large watery stools.  Patient had no recent antibiotic use and has no C. difficile risk factors, suspect this may be related to her Covid vaccine, she had no evidence to suggest anaphylactic shock, patient felt better after IV fluid bolus was able to ambulate around the emergency department without lightheadedness or near syncope.  She had troponins x2 which were negative, her EKG was nonischemic and there was no evidence of ectopy or arrhythmia.  Patient did have syncope and fell onto her side, she denies discrete head injury although patient is anticoagulated, CT head was obtained to rule out intracranial hemorrhage given the syncopal event.  Patient CT abd/pelvix was negative for obvious cause of patient&#39;s abdominal tenderness may be related to her diarrheal illness patient will be prescribed Bentyl.  She will call her primary care doctor in the morning to arrange close follow-up.  She understands need for aggressive oral hydration at home.  She will have low threshold to return should she develop lightheadedness syncope chest pain shortness of breath palpitations worsening abdominal pain bloody or dark stools any new or concerning symptoms.  The patient presented to the emergency department with potentially life or limb-threatening symptoms.      After my history, examination, and workup have decided that the patient is stable.    My impression is that they are safe to go home at this time.  I have reviewed ED return precautions with the patient. They understand to return if they are concerned for any reason.   They will follow-up with their PCP in 1-2 days.        Impression:  Syncope, hypotensionimproved, dehydration  Plan:   Discharge   Follow Up    Within: 1-2 days    Comments: Please call your doctor in the morning to arrange follow-up with your primary care doctor in the next 24 hours.  Please stay well-hydrated and eat regular meals.  Please take Bentyl as needed for abdominal cramping with diarrhea.  Please return to the ER if you develop worsening abdominal pain, feelings of lightheadedness passing out any new or concerning symptoms.

                                                VACCINE received on Friday 1/15/2021 afternoon; Monday evening 1/18/2021 felt slight chills; early to bed. Tuesday AM awoke with severe &#39;bed-rocking&#39; chills, nausea and fever 100-101 degrees. recommended I go to Hospital ER.  At ER, temperature increased to 102 degrees.  Covid test was negative, but cost X-ray showed reasons to suspect pneumonia. No one suggested I was just suffering acute reaction to vaccine.  Returned home w/ prescription for doxycycline hyclate and request that I return to the ER the next day if I continued to feel ill.  The next morning, 1/19/21, I again awoke with intense, somewhat frightening chills, vomiting and a mild fever.  As instructed I returned to the ER.  Assuming the COVID Test may have been a false negative, a second one was given; it too turned out to be negative, but I remained at the ER and then admitted to Hospital to remain under observation.  Im the hospital the chills, nausea and fever came to an end, but acute headache and utter fatigue lasted until I was released on Jan 22.  My discharge papers indicated no further signs of pneumonia or any other infection; my attending doctor, concluded that my experience was an unusually strong (and delayed) reaction to the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 025LZ0A) intramuscularly in her right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient experienced heart beating very fast and feeling uncomfortable; it lasted for a few hours. She stated it was atrial fibrillation, she had a diagnosis of this, and it only lasted a few hours. The patient also stated that her blood glucose was 150, which was higher than normal.  Treatment for the events was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, increased blood sugar, was considered not resolved. The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and feeling uncomfortable, was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76 year-old female patient with a significant medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and non-serious unexpected events of Discomfort and Blood glucose increased. The events occurred one day (same day) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 025LZ0A. Treatment was not reported. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes were considered strong confounders.

Stayed in bed with head flat for 2 days. Had to be helped to the bathroom. No walking capabilities. Gradually started coming out of it on the third day, still not able to have head up while trying to eat and drink. 4th day better in the morning with head up and walking. Seemingly gone by evening. Horrible episode.

Hairstylist removed her mask and she then passed out.  Called 911.  They observed my mom sweating, her lips and hands were swollen, she was slack jawed, pale and clammy.   After several minutes she came out of it.  Was given a piece of candy thinking it was a sugar low, but her sugar was high 285 @9:00am.  Her color was still pale and she was still incoherent.  While still on with 911, she became more lucid and said she was feeling better, so ambulance was canceled.   I drove her home and checked her sugar @11:00 - 295 and BP 125/55 pulse 75.  She stayed with me for the rest of Saturday.  Her sugar was still high Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  Upon checking her blood sugar log, her sugar had gone up for a week following the first shot.

Vitals, EKG, CT scan, and MRI conducted. MRI showed an acute mild stroke on R side of brain.  Over-night stay was recommended. Echocardiogram was performed the following day and nothing was abnormal. I am now on a heart monitor for 30 days. Upon departure of hospital the symptoms in L leg and arm have nearly resolved but face is still numb/decreased sensation. Plan to contact PCP tomorrow.

Rapid heart beat followed by afib that was not terminated with normal medications. Dizziness and shortness of breath. Hospitalized with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It resolved after getting two injections of a medication called diltiazem in the emergency department, after which I was monitored overnight in the hospital. Underwent stress test and echocardiogram - results  normal. On the day I write this (March 1) continue to have  shorter periods of rise in blood pressure and heart rate,  diaphragm tightness, insomnia and lethargy.

She was tossing and looked like she was trying to get up. He was talking to her and she wasn?t answering him. She was having trouble breathing. Took her to the hospital right away at 7:30 pm. They put her into a comma with a respirator. Finally went from emergency room to ICU on Monday. Then on Wednesday they took the respirator out and I spoke to her ? told her we all love her and she could only say hoarsely ?terrible, terrible.? They said she might get moved to regular floor. But then Wednesday night couldn?t breathe again and put the respirator back in. Thursday morning husband had it removed and she died that evening at 10:51 on February 25.

                                                Ischemic attack; Severe high blood pressure; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 77-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced severe high blood pressure (BP) and ischemic attack.  The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included atorvastatin calcium, bupropion hydrochloride, gabapentin, ibuprofen, estradiol and metformin.  On 08 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, the patient was taken by ambulance to the hospital with severe high BP. During her hospital stay the patient&#39;s BP readings were 190s/109. The patient was diagnosed with ischemic attack.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital. Her BP readings since then have been 179/85.   On 19 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s BP reading was 145/80.   Treatment for the event included lisinopril.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome of the events, severe high BP and ischemic attack, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 77-year-old female patient with medical history of diabetes who experienced the serious unlisted events of Hypertension and Transient ischaemic attack that required hospitalization. The events occurred approximately four days after receiving their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A), Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. Of note, patient&#39;s elderly age and history of diabetes are considered risk factors for the occurrence of the events.

By Feb. 10, 2021 I had low fever and difficulty breathing so I went to Urgent Care, after blood work, received chest X-ray, EKG, CT scan. It came back with pneumonia. My biggest quest is can safely take the second one or a different one, with emphysema you need protection. Thank you

At 3 am the next morning she reported to the ED c/o being &#34;fluish&#34; and short of breath. She was found to be hypoxic to the upper 80&#39;s on RA, and a CXR was consistent with CHF.  She stated she had some off and on chest pain for the last few weeks, especially with exertion. Ultimately it was found that she had an elevated troponin and was felt to have had an MI. She underwent cardiac cath and a stent was placed in a 95% ostial right coronary stenosis.   Although she was reported as having had a &#34;hyperimmune&#34; response to the vaccine, I can only say for certain she had flash pulmonary edema due to cardiac ischemia that was due to a stenosis in her RCA that had been there for quite some time, but possibly just happened to become critical right after her second COVID vaccine. It would be hard to blame the vaccine, but it is also impossible I guess to absolve it from any role in her MI.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

                                                As I was driving at 70 mph along the highway 4 days after I had my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, suddenly I went blind in my right eye. I was blind in that eye for about 10 minutes. We drove  right away to my eye doctor, who sent me to the ER. The hospital is Stroke Certified. They admitted me and did a stroke workup. I was in the hospital for 1 day (24 hours) which included overnight.  The treating HCP concluded that I had experienced an ocular stroke. Since it was exactly 4 days after my second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, it most likely was caused by that vaccine.

After second injection, March 1, 2021 began having very frequent visual migraines and light headaches and went to emergency room.  7 days later I had an occipital stroke and was hospitalized for several days.  I am slowly recovering.  Symptoms were only visual but quite severe for a short time.

On 06-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (heart went to into a-fib) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (hurting badly at injection site). On 07-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (small stroke) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (light and dark spots). The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to ATRIAL FIBRILLATION and CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT. At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (heart went to into a-fib) and CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (small stroke) outcome was unknown, VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (light and dark spots) had resolved and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (hurting badly at injection site) had not resolved.        mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Pleasant 78-year-old female with history of lung cancer with remote partial pneumonectomy, some element of COPD and chronic respiratory failure on home oxygen therapy. She presents with worsening shortness of breath, which started rather abruptly the day prior to presentation. On arrival to the ED she was mildly tachypneic and slightly tachycardic and appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. Her O2 had been titrated to 4 L/m nasal cannula in order to sustain SaO2 values in the 90% or above range. Patient also noted to have pallor. No hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, fever, cough or known exposure to COVID. Patient reports having received her first COVID vaccination just over one 1 week ago. A hypochromic microcytic anemia, progressive, was noted with a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Patient reported that she was up-to-date on EGD and colonoscopy within the past year without findings of acute pathology or bleeding. A CTA of the chest was conducted with findings of bilateral pulmonary emboli. She denies lower extremity swelling, pain or tenderness. Patient placed in observation in order to provide palliative blood replacement therapy and commence with anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism.  DISCHARGE SUMMARY/OBSERVATION COURSE: Uneventful observation course for this pleasant 78-year-old female who presented with somewhat sudden worsening of her chronic shortness of breath and was found to have CTA evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli. This in the setting of a progressive iron deficiency anemia without evidence of active clinical gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells in a palliative fashion for her presenting hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Posttransfusion hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dL. Concurrently, she was placed on weight-based low molecular weight heparin for full anticoagulation. I examined the patient on the morning of February 12 and found her to be nondistressed. Her SaO2 value was 96% on 4 L/m nasal cannula O2. Recall that her baseline flow rate historically had been 2 L/m his cannula. Etiology of the patient&#39;s thromboembolism uncertain. She had no clinical findings of unilateral or bilateral lower extremity swelling or tenderness. Patient noted to be a survivor of both breast and lung cancers but without known evidence of active persistent malignancy. Of interest, she had received a COVID-19 vaccine just over one week prior to presentation. I contacted pharmacy in this regard and encouraged him to report possible adverse event via VAERS. I recommended a course of rivaroxaban and provided a prescription with a VTE dosing schedule. Patient was advised to followup with Dr in 10 days.  M.D., Hospital Medicine    MD Feb 12, 2021 08:40

                                                Admitted to hospital for acute on chronic respiratory failure following covid vaccination.  (patient significantly fatigued, slept most of the day after vaccine, not on BIPAP as needed)  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  patient is a 78 y.o. female with a history of oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and persistent atrial fibrillation who presents today with general malaise.  She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study. Patient is diuresing and will likely be able to discharge tomorrow.

I do not have further information on the medical aspect of this as we were not her treating provider but did administer the vaccine on 12 February.

                                                Patient came with husband to Vaccine clinic today 3/5 for 2nd dose of vaccine. Did well during and immediately after vaccine. Husband states patient has c/o severe chest pressure and pain for several weeks but has refused to come to ER for evaluation. Today, after getting vaccine dose and going to local bank, patient was in passenger side of truck when chest pain started again. Husband begged patient to let him take her to the ER but she said no, I?m fine and I don?t want to go. She then went unresponsive. At a stop light, he was next to a couple of cops who he was able to wave down and proceed to escort them in to ER. Upon arrival to the ER, patient was unresponsive and pulseless. CPR was initiated, 1 defib, and 1mg of epi was given. Return of pulse was obtained, but husband asked for no life support and only comfort measures. Patient was admitted for comfort measures.  I do NOT think this was related to her vaccine, but rather the unfortunately end to a sub-acute chest pain patient that declined multiple urgings to seek care.  Patient then expired on 3/5/21 at 2037.

                                                5. Brief History and Hospital Course:  Patient is a/an 79 y.o. female with a past history significant for HTN, HLD, and DM who presented to facility on 3/9/2021 with complaints of severe 8/10 right jaw pain lasting 3 minutes. EKG with new left BBB and troponin mildly elevated 8-17-35-26. She was seen by Cardiology and determined to have NSTEMI and taken for cardiac cath with drug eluting stent placed to LAD. Echo was also ordered with evidence of murmur. Cavity size is normal. Wall thickness is normal. Systolic function is normal. The estimated ejection fraction is 55%. Dyssynchronous interventricular septal motion, likely related to conduction abnormality/bundle branch block. Grade I diastolic dysfunction. Annulus is severely calcified. Severely calcified and restricted opening of posterior mitral leaflet. Mild mitral valve stenosis at the max.  She remained stable post stent placement. She remained on dual antiplatelet therapy

                                                I became progressively more sleepy the afternoon after the vaccination, as expected.  I did get up and make dinner, then went to bed at 9:15 p.m. on March 8th and slept until 9:15 a.m. March 9th.  I felt unstable walking into the bathroom to urinate, and even more unstable waking into the kitchen to take my meds. I passed out and woke up on the floor.  I was weak but managed to pull myself up holding on to the kitchen range. I headed for the living room sofa and passed out again, waking up on the floor by the sofa.  I&#39;m guessing I was unconscious about 2 minutes each time, but don&#39;t really know. I lay down on the sofa and called a neighbor.  He thought I should call 911, and they came and drove me to  ER .  They did an EKG, chest x-ray, and CAT scan of my brain, and drew blood.  All results were normal. I returned home that same day (March 9)  and had little energy, and ate lightly.  When I was getting in bed about 10:30 p.m. I let my head drop on the pillow and the room started to whirl around me for about six seconds.  Sometimes when I roll over in bed during the night there is a pause before   it feels like the room gives one spin.  My scalp is very tender in the large area where I hit it twice when passing out.  I&#39;m taking it easy again today, but do feel a little stronger.  I am normally exceptionally healthy for my age, and work , traveling to destinations to research and photograph my articles. Both the travel and article take stamina, and I thrive on the work.

                                                shortness of breath, pain in chest increasingly more severe as time went on. Noticed shortness of breath about 12 days after the vaccine was given. I am a 2 mile a day walker and very healthy. It was below freezing and I attributed the shortness of breath to weather. I went to an ER on March 8, 2021  after realizing symptoms were worse. I was admitted with Pulmonary embolism in both lungs and pneumonia in both lungs. The hospitalist could  not give me a reason why this happened. He encouraged me to report this incident. You would need to contact him for tests and such. I am a patient. I live where medical help is limited. The vaccine was administered at a clinic but the ER I went to was a different system.

She reported having a mild headache all day but no other problems. She was putting drops in her husband&#39;s eyes around 11pm and told him she needed to sit down that she was going to &#34;pass out.&#34; Her husband said she did pass out and he called 911. He said she was unconscious maybe 3 or 4 minutes. She woke up alert and knew what had happened. The EMT&#39;s checked her out--said she had no temperature, blood pressure was ok, and blood sugar was 280. They told the couple they thought it was probably from the vaccine. They wanted to transport her to the ER to be &#34;checked out&#34; but the patient refused to go. She has not had any problems since the incident except some fatigue

                                                My mother received her vaccine at 12:40 on 2/2. She waited longer than the fifteen minutes and she seemed fine. We left the facility and on the way home, approximately 45 after she received the vaccine, she began slurring her words ands was confused. The slurring lasted for 2-3 minutes The confusion continued. I brought her the ER where she was immediately taken in for  a CT Scan. She later had an MRI, and met with a Cardiologist. She later had an EEG at the request of a Neurologist. She spent three nights in the hospital.  All tests showed no acute signs of stroke, etc.

I woke at 2:00am the following morning to go to the restroom and my dog needed to go out.  I felt light headed as soon as she was back in the house.  I felt things going dark and I passed out in the hallway.  I don&#39;t know how long I was out but when I came to, I felt like I couldn&#39;t move.  I laid there for a while and finally crawled back to my bed.  I was able to get back in bed.  By then it was 3:00am.  The next night I woke in the night and had an irregular heartbeat.  I could not get back to sleep until it finally went away.  For several days after the vaccination, I had very little energy.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.

On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included carvedilol, acetyl salicylic acid and an occasional injection for hives. The last injection for hives was administered a week and a half ago.  On 10 Mar 2021 at 4pm, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027A21A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Mar 2021, it was reported that the patient became unresponsive and she appeared to be having a stroke. The patient was taken to the emergency room where she underwent treatment.  No other details were provided.  Treatment information were not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of events, became unresponsive and it looked like a stroke, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event/s has been provided at this time.

On 06 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 61016308) in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Mar 2021, the patient experienced pneumonia with collapsed lung and was hospitalized.  She was scheduled to take second dose of vaccine on 26 Mar 2021.  Treatment for the event included hospitalization for pneumonia with collapsed lung.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, pneumonia with collapsed lung was unknown.  The outcome of the event, inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered was considered to be resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 80-year-old who had second dose scheduled 6 weeks after first dose (inappropriate schedule of product administration) and also experienced collapsed lung/pneumonia. Although a temporal association exist, based on the information provided, the event of collapsed lung/pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related.  Pneumonia is due to an infective etiology.  The event of inappropriate schedule of product administration is assessed as not applicable.

At around 6 am the following day, on the morning of 3/27 she was found on the floor, and presumably suffered from a heart attack. After devastation to our family, we called her physician and he himself was also surprised. Although she is a type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure she has maintained great health and kept her conditions under control with her medications. This, unfortunately, seems too coincidental to not have been in some way or completely caused by the second dose of the shot.

I was going to go sit down, but I passed out and fell onto the kitchen floor for a few  seconds.   I have never passed out before or felt such light-headedness.  I went to lay down.   I vomited a bit of liquid.  I lay down and several hours later my husband drove me to the emergency room.  After many tests they said I had suffered a Syncope and had a slight concussion.

No official diagnosis, treat as  ITP.   Follow up visits with oncologist/haematologist to keep an eye on platelets as they increase.   March 30-Apr 4 - ER visit due to swelling of ankles, feet, and left arm. Tests show superficial blood clot, fluid on lungs, and pneumonia. Oncologist said that &#34;we have no official diagnosis&#34;, that she&#39;s being treated for ITP.   April 6-14 - follow up visit to oncologist/haematologist show elevated kidney enzymes, then later liver enzymes,  low sodium.   April 14 - decision to move to short term rehab for regular PT and OT. Continued swelling (fluid in third spaces.)   April 21 - visit to cardiologist to perform cardioversion, successful (during first week of hospital stay, heart rhythm med had to stop).   April 23 - facility nurse discovered significantly low Hemoglobin and a blood transfusion was ordered.    April 24 - returned to short term rehab facility.   April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to &#34;get it out of her system.&#34; Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

                                                Had a stroke; A spontaneous report was received from a caregiver concerning an 81-years-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine and had a stroke.  Patient&#39;s medical history included a mini stroke (5-6 years ago). Concomitant medication included blood thinners.  On 02 Feb 2021 at 4:30 pm, ten days prior to onset of the event stroke, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot/batch: unknown) for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient had an event of stroke for which was hospitalized. The patient was on a lot of medications (not specified).   Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not recorded.  The outcome of the event stroke was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of stroke, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s elderly age and prior history of TIA are considered as risk factors.

                                                I video chatted with her Thursday after receiving the vaccine. My mom was in poor health but she was talking in complete sentences and responded appropriately. She was upright in bed and made eye contact. She smiled and denied pain. By Sunday, she was extremely weak and unable to sip water with a straw. Her health had changed dramatically and rapidly. She moaned in pain and was very fatigued. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the week and she stopped talking and was constantly sleeping. They started antibiotics for the oozing cancer lesion and then morphine for pain and end of life care. She passed away on January 22nd which was 15 days post vaccination.

                                                Patient reported feeling weak, fatigue, fever (102), and loss of appetite. Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

Then she called her brother who is a doctor and he told her to go to Cardiologist and get in. She was talking normal by the time she talked to him.  Adverse reaction was TIA.    TIA symptoms lasted 5-10 minutes max per patient.

Patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation. Relevant concomitant medications included prednisone and benadryl.   On 28 JAN 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On the same day, patient experienced atrial fibrillation.  On 29 JAN 2021, she was so tired and had no energy and was very weak which lasted for 6 days. She thought that this was due to prednisone and Benadryl prophylactically. On the same day, her sinus rhythm was found to be back to normal. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events atrial fibrillation was considered resolved on 29 JAN 2021 and the events so tired and no energy, very weak were considered resolved on 04 FEB 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 82 year old female patient, with medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (2016), who experienced a serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation, among other non-serious events, after receiving first dose mRNA- 1273 (Lot# unknown). Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I was seen by emergency medical personnel, had an EKG, and then my children, with whom I live, took me to see my primary care provider who ordered some basic blood tests: a CBC and panel.  All blood tests were normal as well as the EKG, I assume.  We think the faint was perhaps triggered by the diarrhea and exertion of chores in addition to the vaccine&#39;s effect .    Since then I have had fatigue.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (also treated with 5 days of Remdesivir) in January 2021 and Lumpectomy. Concomitant products included NICOTINAMIDE, PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE, RIBOFLAVIN, THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (VITAMIN-B COMPLEX), ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN-C), VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS], ZINC, APIXABAN (ELIQUIS), CARVEDILOL, ATORVASTATIN and LETROZOLE for an unknown indication.    On 03-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 04-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (hit her head and blacked out) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling awful), MALAISE (not felt well ever since), DECREASED APPETITE (don&#39;t feel like eating), COVID-19 (feeling the same symptoms as she did when she had covid), TASTE DISORDER (taste not the same), HEADACHE (headache), FATIGUE (Fatigue), MYALGIA (mucsle aches), NAUSEA (slight nausea) and INJECTION SITE LYMPHADENOPATHY (problem with a lymph node in that arm). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (hit her head and blacked out), FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling awful), MALAISE (not felt well ever since), DECREASED APPETITE (don&#39;t feel like eating), COVID-19 (feeling the same symptoms as she did when she had covid), TASTE DISORDER (taste not the same), HEADACHE (headache), FATIGUE (Fatigue), MYALGIA (mucsle aches), NAUSEA (slight nausea) and INJECTION SITE LYMPHADENOPATHY (problem with a lymph node in that arm) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Mammogram: sensitive (Inconclusive) Sensitive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.  Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded. Headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea and injection site lymphadenopathy are consistent with the product safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.

She was found to have an abrupt drop in both hemoglobin (13-&gt;9g/dl) and platelets (300s-- &gt;104) 2 days after her 2nd vaccine.  Her hydrea dose was lowered and repeat blood work 1 month later demonstrated platelets of 64 and hemoglobin of 6.7.  patient was admitted to the hospital and was transfused 2 units of blood.  Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 50% cellular marrow with grade three fibrosis consistent with Post-ET MF. No evidence of hemolysis, vitamin, or iron deficiency.  Spleen not enlarged.  Hydrea was stopped completely during admission.  Today&#39;s blood work (4/8/2021) demonstrates continued thrombocytopenia and anemia - platelets of 54 and hemoglobin of 7.5.

This continued for over 2 weeks and then started having chest pain.  Went to ER and admitted with pericarditis.  2 days later I went into Atrial fib.  The next day I had a cardioversion.  Home the following day.  One week at home not feeling well, I was readmitted with increased chest pain and shortness of breath.  Pulse very low and needed a pacemaker which was inserted Easter Sunday.  Home now and still not feeling well.

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

Lasted all night and next day started to get less until Friday morning.  Feeling good that day and went to friends house for dinner.  At end of dinner felt like going to throw up but instead I passed out for 1-2 minutes (have never passed out in my life!).  Medics came and ran several tests but all was okay and I have had no trouble since.

                                                Got the vaccine and was feeling tired, and her arm hurt, an all she wanted to do was lay in bed with her heating pad.  The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

I am not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but the rapid antigen for Sars-CoV2 was positive and the PCR was negative.  I am reporting this event because of the lack of clarity on this issue and the positivity of the Sars-CoV2 was beyond the parameters of 14 days in the phase three trials.

We called 911 right away but, by the time EMS arrived, she was unconscious and didn&#39;t appear to be breathing. Patient was not sick at the time this occurred but she was hospitalized in December of 2019 and was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension which required her to go home with and continue on supplemental oxygen. However, she never experienced pulmonary distress after coming home and her SPO2 levels consistently ranged between 96 and 99% with supplemental oxygen. Patient&#39;s death was very sudden and unexpected.

She was eating breakfast after at home and complained to a neighbor that her teeth hurt and she was nauseated after eating. In the afternoon, she felt dizzy and had diarrhea accompanied with blood.

As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away.

On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again.

Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

After getting up from bed and eating her usual breakfast, she was returning to her bedroom when she became dizzy and fainted, falling to the floor, hitting her head and suffering other effects, including rhabdomyolysis from being on the floor for a long time after the fall as she was unable to get up. She was transported to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days. She was treated with IV fluids, Tylenol and a short course of antibiotics. While hospitalized, she had a repeat of a rash/swelling at injection site that began about 48 hours after vaccination.  The hospital treated the rash with some barrier cream and within 48, the redness, rash and swelling abated.

The dizziness and vertigo continue through the day Along with chills and nausea throughout the day. My biggest concern was the dizziness which has never happened before. I took her to the emergency room which resulted in a diagnosis of a fractured and displaced clavicle . The dizziness was the most concerning part and they ruled out any cerebrovascular causes. A meclizine 25 mg was given and also prescribe for her when she was discharged. I am a registered pharmacist and is a healthcare provider I looked into the side effects listed.

By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

She no longer had to energy for her daily exercise walks and became increasingly lethargic. She died in her sleep while taking an afternoon nap on Thursday, February 4th. I am highly concerned this could be a vaccine related.

I talked with the husband briefly about why his wife was hospitalized. He reported she got sick 2 days after getting her first COVID-19 vaccine. He states she had pneumonia, had a urinary tract infection and had to have a heart catherization with stent placement. We moved her second vaccine appointment to February 17th. The spouse came in on February 8th for his 2nd dose. He told me the doctors did not believe his wife&#39;s hospitalization was related to the first COVID vaccine and he said the doctor&#39;s told him that she needed her 2nd dose.

The pt reported 2 episodes of SOB and lightheadedness, with the second one as the more severe. On her second episode, she felt severe shortness of breath, tried to walk quickly to her bed with her walker, and fell into her bed. CT angio demonstrated acute saddle PE, mild right heart strain, RUL pulmonary infarct, and mild multifocal pneumonia with suspicion of COVID; IR was consulted and suggested thrombectomy due to the severity of the embolism. In the ED, she was started on heparin drip and put on low-flow NC oxygen without distress. Upon arrival to the emergency department her vital signs were significant for T 36.4, SBP 120/81, HR 95 bpm, NSR, RR 18, FiO2 94% on room air.  Her oxygen increased to 98% on 2 L nasal cannula.  Her laboratory values revealed WBCs 15.1, Hb 14.4, HCT 43.4, PLT 321, neutrophils 68.8%, D-dimer 4642, NA 134, K3.4, anion gap 9, BUN 17, creatinine 1.00, glucose 163, troponin elevated 0.12, 0.25, and 0.41, urinalysis is unremarkable, COVID-19 swab is positive.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine 15 hours after I received the vaccination (3 AM of the morning of February 24) I went to the bathroom to take two Tylenol for a headache. I then used the toilet and started walking back to bed (less than 20 feet away). About halfway there, I I realized something was wrong. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground right next to my bed. On the way down I think I heard crashing into wood furniture. I don?t know how long I was blacked out; it might have been 10 minutes. I managed to get up onto the bed and felt something wet on my pillow case. It was blood coming from a deep laceration on my chin. My doctor told me to go to urgent care. They sent me to the emergency room. I was kept overnight for observation and give three stitches in my chin. I have felt woozy ever since, but all the tests administered in the hospital showed no damage.

Urologist doesn&#39;t see any possible correlation but I am now on a third round of antibiotics.  Three days after my second shot on 3/12/2021 bleeding again started so now am now back on antibiotics.

Patient had blood taken at her appointment and was waiting when the nurse came back out and said her blood had clotted so they needed to redraw her blood. She states this has never happened before and wondered if her blood clotting would have been due to her covid vaccine the week prior. She states the first girl who drew her blood was slower than the second time around when a different nurse drew her blood.

Patient had her second shot around 3/7/2021 u sure as she is in a rehab facility time of day was 1630. On the 17 th of March she started having back pain then wasn?t able to get herself to the hospital called 911 and was transported to the hospital and that night had emergency surgery for a blood clot in her neck. She was in rehab and got rushed back to the hospital and had a pacemaker placed.  She is still in a rehab facility.

She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.  She flat lined at the hospital and her body went into shock.  She ended up having Kidney, Heart and Liver Failure.  She was still driving and doing all of her cooking, banking, shopping, showering, walking every day on Feb 18th.  She died on March 5th.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) in an 87-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 029L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Penicillin allergy, Syncope (granddaughter states patient has episodes of syncope) and Wheelchair user.    On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant). 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) had resolved and URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   After administration, the patient remained in waiting area for the recommended 15 minutes observation time. Approximately 20 minutes after vaccination, patient was unconscious and appeared not to be breathing, but pulse was palpable. Pharmacist administered 1 dose of 0.3mg epinephrine via epi-pen into patient&#39;s left thigh. The patient quickly regained consciousness, spoke to family, said she did not feel well. Emergency medical services (ems) arrived. The patient began to vomit, was placed on stretcher and left with ems. A few hours later the granddaughter reported that the patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and physical exam by emergency room (ER) attributed her experience to untreated infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Vomiting is consistent with event safety profile.

She did not have any reaction at all until she woke up 13 days later on 3/5/2021 and her left eye was blind.  She had some sort of blob that changes colors and moves around.  It sometimes is orange.  She knew she did not have macular degeneration as it centers it.  Sometimes it sparkles and has grain to it.  He said that she had an arterial blood, and that leaked from the carotid artery into the eye has not completely sealed off.  She can see out of the right eye perfectly, but she cannot see a little out of the left eye.  If she&#39;s watching the TV she can see the top of the newscasters hair, but she cannot see anything below that.  Her vision is upward either, can see out of either side, but cannot below horizontal down.  He told her that it was basically a stroke that didn&#39;t reach her brain and went to her eye.  He told her to return to see him (ophthalmologist) on 5/18/21 at 10:00 AM.  She also is to see her PCP on 5/20/21.

It was likely she had sudden death as she did not activate her neck alert or call button in her apartment.  Family request we report the incident, she was last seen on 12/15/2020 for pacemaker check, she also had medical message communication with me on 2/8 to request refill on her Percocet that she takes occ for her joint pain only at bed time.  family suspect possible DVT with PE after getting more informed about vaccine side effects. however no autopsy was done.

                                                Patient  seen and evaluated by PA-C. with myself.  We agreed on the clinical findings and implemented our plan together.  Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time. Please see MDM section and the rest of the note for further information on patient assessment and treatment.
