                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

                                                VACCINE received on Friday 1/15/2021 afternoon; Monday evening 1/18/2021 felt slight chills; early to bed. Tuesday AM awoke with severe &#39;bed-rocking&#39; chills, nausea and fever 100-101 degrees. recommended I go to Hospital ER.  At ER, temperature increased to 102 degrees.  Covid test was negative, but cost X-ray showed reasons to suspect pneumonia. No one suggested I was just suffering acute reaction to vaccine.  Returned home w/ prescription for doxycycline hyclate and request that I return to the ER the next day if I continued to feel ill.  The next morning, 1/19/21, I again awoke with intense, somewhat frightening chills, vomiting and a mild fever.  As instructed I returned to the ER.  Assuming the COVID Test may have been a false negative, a second one was given; it too turned out to be negative, but I remained at the ER and then admitted to Hospital to remain under observation.  Im the hospital the chills, nausea and fever came to an end, but acute headache and utter fatigue lasted until I was released on Jan 22.  My discharge papers indicated no further signs of pneumonia or any other infection; my attending doctor, concluded that my experience was an unusually strong (and delayed) reaction to the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 025LZ0A) intramuscularly in her right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient experienced heart beating very fast and feeling uncomfortable; it lasted for a few hours. She stated it was atrial fibrillation, she had a diagnosis of this, and it only lasted a few hours. The patient also stated that her blood glucose was 150, which was higher than normal.  Treatment for the events was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, increased blood sugar, was considered not resolved. The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and feeling uncomfortable, was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76 year-old female patient with a significant medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and non-serious unexpected events of Discomfort and Blood glucose increased. The events occurred one day (same day) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 025LZ0A. Treatment was not reported. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes were considered strong confounders.

Vitals, EKG, CT scan, and MRI conducted. MRI showed an acute mild stroke on R side of brain.  Over-night stay was recommended. Echocardiogram was performed the following day and nothing was abnormal. I am now on a heart monitor for 30 days. Upon departure of hospital the symptoms in L leg and arm have nearly resolved but face is still numb/decreased sensation. Plan to contact PCP tomorrow.

Rapid heart beat followed by afib that was not terminated with normal medications. Dizziness and shortness of breath. Hospitalized with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It resolved after getting two injections of a medication called diltiazem in the emergency department, after which I was monitored overnight in the hospital. Underwent stress test and echocardiogram - results  normal. On the day I write this (March 1) continue to have  shorter periods of rise in blood pressure and heart rate,  diaphragm tightness, insomnia and lethargy.

She was tossing and looked like she was trying to get up. He was talking to her and she wasn?t answering him. She was having trouble breathing. Took her to the hospital right away at 7:30 pm. They put her into a comma with a respirator. Finally went from emergency room to ICU on Monday. Then on Wednesday they took the respirator out and I spoke to her ? told her we all love her and she could only say hoarsely ?terrible, terrible.? They said she might get moved to regular floor. But then Wednesday night couldn?t breathe again and put the respirator back in. Thursday morning husband had it removed and she died that evening at 10:51 on February 25.

                                                Ischemic attack; Severe high blood pressure; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 77-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced severe high blood pressure (BP) and ischemic attack.  The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included atorvastatin calcium, bupropion hydrochloride, gabapentin, ibuprofen, estradiol and metformin.  On 08 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, the patient was taken by ambulance to the hospital with severe high BP. During her hospital stay the patient&#39;s BP readings were 190s/109. The patient was diagnosed with ischemic attack.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital. Her BP readings since then have been 179/85.   On 19 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s BP reading was 145/80.   Treatment for the event included lisinopril.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome of the events, severe high BP and ischemic attack, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 77-year-old female patient with medical history of diabetes who experienced the serious unlisted events of Hypertension and Transient ischaemic attack that required hospitalization. The events occurred approximately four days after receiving their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A), Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. Of note, patient&#39;s elderly age and history of diabetes are considered risk factors for the occurrence of the events.

By Feb. 10, 2021 I had low fever and difficulty breathing so I went to Urgent Care, after blood work, received chest X-ray, EKG, CT scan. It came back with pneumonia. My biggest quest is can safely take the second one or a different one, with emphysema you need protection. Thank you

                                                The patient had her second Moderna shot on Feb 17, 2021. At 3 am the next morning she reported to the ED c/o being &#34;fluish&#34; and short of breath. She was found to be hypoxic to the upper 80&#39;s on RA, and a CXR was consistent with CHF.  She stated she had some off and on chest pain for the last few weeks, especially with exertion. Ultimately it was found that she had an elevated troponin and was felt to have had an MI. She underwent cardiac cath and a stent was placed in a 95% ostial right coronary stenosis.   Although she was reported as having had a &#34;hyperimmune&#34; response to the vaccine, I can only say for certain she had flash pulmonary edema due to cardiac ischemia that was due to a stenosis in her RCA that had been there for quite some time, but possibly just happened to become critical right after her second COVID vaccine. It would be hard to blame the vaccine, but it is also impossible I guess to absolve it from any role in her MI.

They asked me my symptoms and then sent me for a Sonagram and discovered a DVT and later a Pulmonary Embolism in my right lower lung. I am now on Eliquis.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

                                                As I was driving at 70 mph along the highway 4 days after I had my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, suddenly I went blind in my right eye. I was blind in that eye for about 10 minutes. We drove  right away to my eye doctor, who sent me to the ER. The hospital is Stroke Certified. They admitted me and did a stroke workup. I was in the hospital for 1 day (24 hours) which included overnight.  The treating HCP concluded that I had experienced an ocular stroke. Since it was exactly 4 days after my second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, it most likely was caused by that vaccine.

After second injection, March 1, 2021 began having very frequent visual migraines and light headaches and went to emergency room.  7 days later I had an occipital stroke and was hospitalized for several days.  I am slowly recovering.  Symptoms were only visual but quite severe for a short time.

This spontaneous case was reported by a nurse (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)), ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) and ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty) in a 77-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 025L20A and 042L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Mercury sensitivity (itching, tearing; reacted once), Shellfish allergy (rash) and Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Concomitant products included AMIODARONE from 06-Feb-2021 to an unknown date for Atrial fibrillation, METOPROLOL SUCCINATE (TOPROL XL) and RIVAROXABAN (XARELTO) for an unknown indication.   On 05-Jan-2021 at 1:00 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021 at 4:00 PM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 05-Feb-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 06-Feb-2021, the patient experienced HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heartbeat after cardioversion). On 14-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and FATIGUE (more fatigue). The patient was hospitalized from 14-Feb-2021 to 16-Feb-2021 due to CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE. At the time of the report, CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)) and ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) had resolved and ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty), HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heartbeat after cardioversion) and FATIGUE (more fatigue) had not resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)), ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty), HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heartbeat after cardioversion) and FATIGUE (more fatigue).    The patient was treated with cardioversion on 06-FEB-2021 and IV Lasix.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The CHF was attributed to the use of the amiodarone for aggravated atrial fibrillation. No further follow-up information is expected.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-006529 (E2B Linked Report).

At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Afib), DIZZINESS (Lightheaded/dizzy), NERVOUSNESS (nervous), DEHYDRATION (Dehydrated), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), DISTURBANCE IN ATTENTION (Problems concentrations) and FATIGUE (Fatigued/Tired) outcome was unknown and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (Problems with vision) had not resolved. For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments Treatment included metoprolol, digoxin and diltiazem. No concomitant medication was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, The patient&#39;s advance age may remain a risk factor for the event Atrial fibrillation. Further information has been requested.

Friend reports that patient complained of &#34;just not feeling right&#34; following vaccine administration. Complained of poor sleep, poor appetite, dyspepsia and began complaining of lower extremity swelling in the weeks following vaccine administration. Was no longer able to line-dance, etc. Was fatigued. Her friends became concerned and encouraged her to seek medical attention, patient reported that she had was prescribed &#34;water pill&#34; and told to &#34;lay off salt,&#34;. Friends later found out that she had lied about doctor&#39;s visit and was self-medicating with over the counter  &#34;water pills&#34; for all of the water weight she was gaining. Eventually developed worsening shortness of breath. Admitted to hospital on 5/4 with shortness of breath and worsening abdominal pain. Found to have systolic heart failure (EF 20-30%) and was in SVT. Also diagnosed with UTI and SMV thrombus. Grossly anasarcic on exam. Treated for heart failure with diuretic and for her UTI with antibiotics, was started on Heparin drip for SMV thrombus. Underwent left heart catheterization at OSH that was negative for significant CAD. Developed worsening septic shock and was transferred to our hospital for higher level of care. Unfortunately had ongoing decline, found to be fungemic. Eventually succumbed to her septic shock, passed away on 5/14/21.  Patient had second dose of vaccine on 3/18/21 according to vaccine card in her purse. Friend states that because of symptoms she developed after first dose of vaccine, she was fearful of getting second dose.  Friends insist that she was well before the vaccine---knee pain was limiting factor for her activity level, never shortness of breath. Of note, several friends tested positive for COVID on 2/11/21, the week prior to patient receiving her vaccine. Patient tested negative and reportedly got tested at frequent intervals and was always negative.

The outcome of the event, acute pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body, was considered resolved on 14 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, pain neck was resolved on 19 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, pneumonia in left lung, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Company Comment: This case concerns a 78-year-old female patient who experienced unexpected serious event of pneumonia and non-serious event of acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body and neck pain.  The event developed on the same day after the first dose and only dose of the vaccine mRNA-1273 vaccine (lot # unknown, expiration date-unknown).  Although a temporal association exist between the event of pneumonia and the administration of the vaccine, in the absence of clinical details including diagnostic test, a definite diagnosis was not established. The events of acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body and neck pain are also temporarily associated with vaccine administration and a causal association cannot be excluded. Main field defaults to possibly related&#39; for all events.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Pleasant 78-year-old female with history of lung cancer with remote partial pneumonectomy, some element of COPD and chronic respiratory failure on home oxygen therapy. She presents with worsening shortness of breath, which started rather abruptly the day prior to presentation. On arrival to the ED she was mildly tachypneic and slightly tachycardic and appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. Her O2 had been titrated to 4 L/m nasal cannula in order to sustain SaO2 values in the 90% or above range. Patient also noted to have pallor. No hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, fever, cough or known exposure to COVID. Patient reports having received her first COVID vaccination just over one 1 week ago. A hypochromic microcytic anemia, progressive, was noted with a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Patient reported that she was up-to-date on EGD and colonoscopy within the past year without findings of acute pathology or bleeding. A CTA of the chest was conducted with findings of bilateral pulmonary emboli. She denies lower extremity swelling, pain or tenderness. Patient placed in observation in order to provide palliative blood replacement therapy and commence with anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism.  DISCHARGE SUMMARY/OBSERVATION COURSE: Uneventful observation course for this pleasant 78-year-old female who presented with somewhat sudden worsening of her chronic shortness of breath and was found to have CTA evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli. This in the setting of a progressive iron deficiency anemia without evidence of active clinical gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells in a palliative fashion for her presenting hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Posttransfusion hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dL. Concurrently, she was placed on weight-based low molecular weight heparin for full anticoagulation. I examined the patient on the morning of February 12 and found her to be nondistressed. Her SaO2 value was 96% on 4 L/m nasal cannula O2. Recall that her baseline flow rate historically had been 2 L/m his cannula. Etiology of the patient&#39;s thromboembolism uncertain. She had no clinical findings of unilateral or bilateral lower extremity swelling or tenderness. Patient noted to be a survivor of both breast and lung cancers but without known evidence of active persistent malignancy. Of interest, she had received a COVID-19 vaccine just over one week prior to presentation. I contacted pharmacy in this regard and encouraged him to report possible adverse event via VAERS. I recommended a course of rivaroxaban and provided a prescription with a VTE dosing schedule. Patient was advised to followup with Dr in 10 days.  M.D., Hospital Medicine    MD Feb 12, 2021 08:40

                                                Admitted to hospital for acute on chronic respiratory failure following covid vaccination.  (patient significantly fatigued, slept most of the day after vaccine, not on BIPAP as needed)  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  patient is a 78 y.o. female with a history of oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and persistent atrial fibrillation who presents today with general malaise.  She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study. Patient is diuresing and will likely be able to discharge tomorrow.

                                                Stroke following administration; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 78 year old ,female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced a stroke/cerebrovascular accident.  The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as previous stroke two years ago. Concomitant medications taken by the patient included losartan, glipizide, lintas, metformin, blood thinners, hydrochlorothiazide.   On 26 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 023M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Feb 2021, the patient experienced a stroke which needed emergency treatment. She received treatment for this condition and was back at home at the time of reporting and at that point she had no other side effects.  Treatment activities for event was received but not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The outcome of event, stroke  was recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s elderly age along with prior history of stroke are considered significant risk factors.

                                                Patient states she received first COVID vaccination approximately one week ago (not a great historian); she tells me about 4 days later she became shorth of breath that progressively worsened - especially with exertion.  She went to ER and was sent home on steroids and antibiotics.  Shortness of breath became worsened so she presented back to ER and CTA was performed.  There is no evidence of PE but patient has what looks to be a chronic DVT of left subclavian vein extending up to IJ junction.  I do not believe this is for sure vaccine related but felt it was important to report it anyway.  She cannot tell me why she takes warfarin at home but I do assume it is for this known chronic DVT.  Unsure of Vaccine brand name.  Most vaccines in this area have been Moderna.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Clot blood in 2010. Concurrent medical conditions included Drug allergy (Dalaudid, Ambien and Demerol) and Hypertension. Concomitant products included DAPAGLIFLOZIN PROPANEDIOL MONOHYDRATE (FARXIGA), GLIMEPIRIDE (AMARYL), ACETYLCARNITINE HYDROCHLORIDE (NEUROTIN [ACETYLCARNITINE HYDROCHLORIDE]), COLECALCIFEROL (CALTRATE VITAMIN D DAILY), MINERALS NOS, VITAMINS NOS (CENTRUM A TO ZINC) and VITAMIN D NOS for an unknown indication.   On 11-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Left leg pain) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), SKIN DISCOLOURATION (Discoloration (blue-purple)) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and SWELLING (Swelling) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced THROMBOSIS (Blood clot) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, THROMBOSIS (Blood clot), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Left leg pain), SKIN DISCOLOURATION (Discoloration (blue-purple)) and SWELLING (Swelling) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient was sent to hospital to remove clots. The patient stated that the clot was 2/3 size of thigh.  The patient scheduled to have a second procedure in May to remove blockages from iliac.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Prior medical history of blood clot is considered a significant risk factor.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My mom, got her first Moderna shot on Feb. 4th, 2021 and developed trombosis in the legs about a week later.  She went to the doctor, who at first didn&#39;t want to see her and told her to elevate her leg. Pt. had a scheduled eye appointment on Feb. 12th  with an other doctor and when she asked if she had any other issues, pt. showed her her leg.  The eye doctor immediately told her to go to urgent care.  When she did she received blood thinners and started injections in her stomach for 5 days.  Feb. 18th pt. suffered a mini stroke and went to the hospital emergency room.  She was transferred over to another facility in the afternoon and kept overnight.  She had a phone appointment with the Dr. on Feb. 24th and on the 26th she received a heart monitor to wear for 2 weeks.  She also had a check up about her leg, which was still swollen.   On March 4, pt. received her second Moderna shot and she was feverish and very tired for days and weeks after.  By March 18th her condition didn&#39;t improve at all and in fact she was felling really bad over night, so on March 19th she was admitted again to the hospital.  She was  monitored and kept over night, but  during the early morning she suffered a stroke and a heart attack and passed way the next day.

                                                Patient came with husband to Vaccine clinic today 3/5 for 2nd dose of vaccine. Did well during and immediately after vaccine. Husband states patient has c/o severe chest pressure and pain for several weeks but has refused to come to ER for evaluation. Today, after getting vaccine dose and going to local bank, patient was in passenger side of truck when chest pain started again. Husband begged patient to let him take her to the ER but she said no, I?m fine and I don?t want to go. She then went unresponsive. At a stop light, he was next to a couple of cops who he was able to wave down and proceed to escort them in to ER. Upon arrival to the ER, patient was unresponsive and pulseless. CPR was initiated, 1 defib, and 1mg of epi was given. Return of pulse was obtained, but husband asked for no life support and only comfort measures. Patient was admitted for comfort measures.  I do NOT think this was related to her vaccine, but rather the unfortunately end to a sub-acute chest pain patient that declined multiple urgings to seek care.  Patient then expired on 3/5/21 at 2037.

Brief History and Hospital Course:  Patient is a/an 79 y.o. female with a past history significant for HTN, HLD, and DM who presented to facility on 3/9/2021 with complaints of severe 8/10 right jaw pain lasting 3 minutes. EKG with new left BBB and troponin mildly elevated 8-17-35-26. She was seen by Cardiology and determined to have NSTEMI and taken for cardiac cath with drug eluting stent placed to LAD. Echo was also ordered with evidence of murmur. Cavity size is normal. Wall thickness is normal. Systolic function is normal. The estimated ejection fraction is 55%.

                                                shortness of breath, pain in chest increasingly more severe as time went on. Noticed shortness of breath about 12 days after the vaccine was given. I am a 2 mile a day walker and very healthy. It was below freezing and I attributed the shortness of breath to weather. I went to an ER on March 8, 2021  after realizing symptoms were worse. I was admitted with Pulmonary embolism in both lungs and pneumonia in both lungs. The hospitalist could  not give me a reason why this happened. He encouraged me to report this incident. You would need to contact him for tests and such. I am a patient. I live where medical help is limited. The vaccine was administered at a clinic but the ER I went to was a different system.

Treatment team Severe sepsis (CMS/HCC) Principal problem Discharge Summary Internal Medicine    Inpatient DeathSummary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admission Date: 4/6/2021     Discharge Date: 4/17/2021  DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Patient is an 79 y.o. female morbidly obese with past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia follow-up that was initially scheduled oncology follow-up for April 7 now postponed to the next 2 weeks, COPD on 2 L oxygen support at home, GERD, depression and anxiety.  She was recently seen in the ED on April 4, 2021 with complaint of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever, chills, nonbloody diarrhea, vomiting and weakness and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.  She had however received a second dose of COVID-19 a week before and was  discharged home due to lack of significant findings on imaging chest x-ray and lack of requirement for higher  oxygen support. She presented to the emergency via EMS for evaluation of progressive shortness of breath with associated with fever, chills, headache, persistent shortness of breath, cough productive of thick clear sputum, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She denies abdominal pain, chest pain, or dizziness.  Denies recent antibiotic usage or recent travel.  Apparently, she thought she was getting better upon discharge after being kept for about 12 hours in the last ED visit, however she was not feeling well after going to bed last night and asked the husband to call 911.  Upon EMS arrival patient was saturating in the 80s and in respiratory distress.  She received 1 DuoNeb and was eventually placed on 10 L oxygen support.  She was noted to be in significant respiratory distress during speech.   Hospital Course Patient was admitted to hospital due to shortness of breath, and was found to have severe sepsis on presentation due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She had evidence of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure as well.  She was started on IV antibiotics, as well as remdesivir and Decadron at high dose.   Unfortunately she continued to have clinical deterioration, and ultimately required high flow oxygen therapy.  She was then transferred to the ICU, and ultimately required intubation due to severe profound ongoing hypoxia despite optimal medical treatment.  She did not respond to remdesivir or steroids or antibiotics.  Post intubation, she also developed acute renal failure during the course of her admission.   Multiple discussions were had throughout the hospitalization regarding goals of care, and initially patient and family wish to be continually aggressive.  She received full medical treatment, including life support, with minimal improvement.  Despite being on ventilator for roughly 5 days, she continued to have severe hypoxia.  She was proned, and was unable to sustain oxygen saturations when supine even for short period.   Her renal function continued to decline as well, and at that point discussion was had with family regarding goals of care again.  They were explained that symptoms continue to be persistent, and her illness continues to progress despite aggressive medical therapy.  Ultimately decision was made to not pursue dialysis, and to allow the patient to be kept comfortable and pass away naturally from this infection.   She was terminally extubated on 4/17 and passed away at 11:16 AM due to COVID-19 and acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.

After her first vaccination in March she started to lose interest in things and didn&#39;t have energy to be as active as she was.  After the second shot with in two days she started to report pain in chest and head and trouble breathing,  She went to her PCP on 5/12 and he wanted her to go to a cardiologist, this referral was made but by the 16th she was in the ER due to extreme chest pain and trouble breathing, a stent was placed in her heart on 4/17/21 my mom&#39;s 80th birthday.   with in 4 days she died.  Her heart just deteriorated. i feel that if she didn&#39;t get this shot she would be alive today, she was healthy, now she is dead.

We left the facility and on the way home, approximately 45 after she received the vaccine, she began slurring her words ands was confused. The slurring lasted for 2-3 minutes The confusion continued. I brought her the ER where she was immediately taken in for  a CT Scan. She later had an MRI, and met with a Cardiologist. She later had an EEG at the request of a Neurologist. She spent three nights in the hospital.  All tests showed no acute signs of stroke, etc.

                                                My mom received her second covid shot at 10:05 AM on 3/26 and experienced no adverse symptoms. At around 6 am the following day, on the morning of 3/27 she was found on the floor, and presumably suffered from a heart attack. After devastation to our family, we called her physician and he himself was also surprised. Although she is a type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure she has maintained great health and kept her conditions under control with her medications. This, unfortunately, seems too coincidental to not have been in some way or completely caused by the second dose of the shot.

No official diagnosis, treat as  ITP.   Follow up visits with oncologist/haematologist to keep an eye on platelets as they increase.   March 30-Apr 4 - ER visit due to swelling of ankles, feet, and left arm. Tests show superficial blood clot, fluid on lungs, and pneumonia. Oncologist said that &#34;we have no official diagnosis&#34;, that she&#39;s being treated for ITP.   April 6-14 - follow up visit to oncologist/haematologist show elevated kidney enzymes, then later liver enzymes,  low sodium.   April 14 - decision to move to short term rehab for regular PT and OT. Continued swelling (fluid in third spaces.)   April 21 - visit to cardiologist to perform cardioversion, successful (during first week of hospital stay, heart rhythm med had to stop).   April 23 - facility nurse discovered significantly low Hemoglobin and a blood transfusion was ordered.    April 24 - returned to short term rehab facility.   April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to &#34;get it out of her system.&#34; Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

Patient&#39;s medical history included a mini stroke (5-6 years ago). Concomitant medication included blood thinners.  On 02 Feb 2021 at 4:30 pm, ten days prior to onset of the event stroke, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot/batch: unknown) for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient had an event of stroke for which was hospitalized. The patient was on a lot of medications (not specified).   Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not recorded.  The outcome of the event stroke was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of stroke, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s elderly age and prior history of TIA are considered as risk factors.

My mom was in poor health but she was talking in complete sentences and responded appropriately. She was upright in bed and made eye contact. She smiled and denied pain. By Sunday, she was extremely weak and unable to sip water with a straw. Her health had changed dramatically and rapidly. She moaned in pain and was very fatigued. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the week and she stopped talking and was constantly sleeping. They started antibiotics for the oozing cancer lesion and then morphine for pain and end of life care. She passed away on January 22nd which was 15 days post vaccination.

                                                Patient reported feeling weak, fatigue, fever (102), and loss of appetite. Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

Then she called her brother who is a doctor and he told her to go to Cardiologist and get in. She was talking normal by the time she talked to him.  Adverse reaction was TIA.    TIA symptoms lasted 5-10 minutes max per patient.

Patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation. Relevant concomitant medications included prednisone and benadryl.   On 28 JAN 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On the same day, patient experienced atrial fibrillation.  On 29 JAN 2021, she was so tired and had no energy and was very weak which lasted for 6 days. She thought that this was due to prednisone and Benadryl prophylactically. On the same day, her sinus rhythm was found to be back to normal. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events atrial fibrillation was considered resolved on 29 JAN 2021 and the events so tired and no energy, very weak were considered resolved on 04 FEB 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 82 year old female patient, with medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (2016), who experienced a serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation, among other non-serious events, after receiving first dose mRNA- 1273 (Lot# unknown). Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Concomitant medications reported included medications for high blood pressure and for high cholesterol.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date, the patient experienced loss of smell, loss of taste, and had pneumonia. The event, pneumonia, was found to be medically significant. On 03 Mar 2021, the patient was not feeling right and on 04 Mar 2021 she was tested positive for Covid-19.  Treatment details included the use of some nebulizers and quarantine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, loss of smell, loss of taste, pneumonia, felt not right, and tested for Covid-19 was unknown and of event and has not received second vaccine yet was resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the events of COVID-19 and Pneumonia.  The events of COVID-19 and Pneumonia is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain infectious elements capable of causing infection.

Went to med center and was seen by Dr.  He was concerned so that he insisted that I go to the hospital to be admitted on Tuesday 4/6/21.  Was admitted and blood work was done and ct abdomen and car which was negative. More lab work was done on 4/7/21 which showed a elevated d-diner. At that time a ultrasound of legs done which showed a clot in my right leg. Then a ct chest was scheduled and done 4/8/21 which showed a clot in my right lung.

                                                On 1/27/21,  after receiving Dose 1 ,  I had some chest pains, shortness of breath and a pulse rate as high as 190.  I (foolishly) did not do anything but suffered through these symptoms at varying degrees of pain/discomfort for about an hour and a half.  Recently on 4/9/21, I experienced these same symptoms.  My heart felt like it was pounding out of my chest; pulse rate was up to 170 and BP was 190/86.  I also had intermittent chest pains at different levels of severity.   Called 911, ambulance took me to healthcare facility where I was advised that I had Atrial Fibrillation.  I don&#39;t know if this is related to the Covid shots but I feel it should be documented.  While I have had high blood pressure for years and I am an older adult, I have never had any heart problems, per se.  I also know it would not be unusual for someone with my characteristics to develop- Atrisl Fibrillation, however, it is suspicious that this occurred only after the covid vaccines were administered.  Pregnancy History; 1 child.

This continued for over 2 weeks and then started having chest pain.  Went to ER and admitted with pericarditis.  2 days later I went into Atrial fib.  The next day I had a cardioversion.  Home the following day.  One week at home not feeling well, I was readmitted with increased chest pain and shortness of breath.  Pulse very low and needed a pacemaker which was inserted Easter Sunday.  Home now and still not feeling well.

                                                My mother was in generally good health for her age, known as the strongest woman to many.  She defied covid for over a year, despite living in an assisted living facility in one of 2020&#39;s &#34;hot zones&#34;.  After taking the vaccine, she died within 2 months.  I definitely believe 100% the vaccine in the very least hastened her health as she began declining immediately after the first dose, with on/off flu like symptoms until her death.

When asked what her sx were, she stated fatigue.  She was well the night of the shot, Thur. and Fri. but became tired on Sat. and Sun.  I went through other sx with her such as h/a, fever, n/v, muscle aches, weakness and she said she experienced none of those.  I questioned her about eating and drinking and she said she ate and drank water.  She seemed fine so I told her to call her doctor if she was worse or the fatigue persisted or call 911.  She agreed.  Two staff from clinic called her Mon. and Tues, (1/18 and 1/19).  On Tues. she may have had sl slurred speech.  She was found deceased on

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

I am reporting this event because of the lack of clarity on this issue and the positivity of the Sars-CoV2 was beyond the parameters of 14 days in the phase three trials.

                                                Diarrhea; A-afib; A spontaneous report was received from an 83-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced diarrhea followed by exacerbation of her A-fib (atrial fibrillation).    The patient&#39;s medical history included hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 25-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number 011M20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01-Feb-2021 (reported a week later), the patient experienced persistent diarrhea.  She stated, &#34;I believe it&#39;s affecting my heart&#34; and that &#34;she went into A-fib since having diarrhea.&#34;      Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The events of diarrhea and atrial fibrillation were not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On 4 Mar 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: Not provided) Intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 4 Mar 2021, the patient could not get up from bed. She stated her muscles, legs, hip and knees were steel. The patient stated she fell while walking, over her right arm- which resulted in the right arm sore and full of blood. The patient stated she had to crawl, drag herself and her joints still swollen, and elbow sore. No treatment information was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcomes of events were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Five days after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, patient suddenly began having trouble breathing. We called 911 right away but, by the time EMS arrived, she was unconscious and didn&#39;t appear to be breathing. Patient was not sick at the time this occurred but she was hospitalized in December of 2019 and was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension which required her to go home with and continue on supplemental oxygen. However, she never experienced pulmonary distress after coming home and her SPO2 levels consistently ranged between 96 and 99% with supplemental oxygen. Patient&#39;s death was very sudden and unexpected.

As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again.

Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history). Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension.   On 28-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 25-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 20-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficult breathing) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 27-Feb-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood clot in lung) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and PYREXIA (fever). At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood clot in lung), DYSPNOEA (Difficult breathing) and PYREXIA (fever) outcome was unknown.            Treatment details included Heparin, Xarelto.  Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, and with reoccurrence of blood clot with second vaccine use, causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.

                                                The following day, food did not taste as it should and water tasted like metal.  By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

I talked with the husband briefly about why his wife was hospitalized. He reported she got sick 2 days after getting her first COVID-19 vaccine. He states she had pneumonia, had a urinary tract infection and had to have a heart catherization with stent placement. We moved her second vaccine appointment to February 17th. The spouse came in on February 8th for his 2nd dose. He told me the doctors did not believe his wife&#39;s hospitalization was related to the first COVID vaccine and he said the doctor&#39;s told him that she needed her 2nd dose.

The pt reported 2 episodes of SOB and lightheadedness, with the second one as the more severe. On her second episode, she felt severe shortness of breath, tried to walk quickly to her bed with her walker, and fell into her bed. CT angio demonstrated acute saddle PE, mild right heart strain, RUL pulmonary infarct, and mild multifocal pneumonia with suspicion of COVID; IR was consulted and suggested thrombectomy due to the severity of the embolism. In the ED, she was started on heparin drip and put on low-flow NC oxygen without distress. Upon arrival to the emergency department her vital signs were significant for T 36.4, SBP 120/81, HR 95 bpm, NSR, RR 18, FiO2 94% on room air.  Her oxygen increased to 98% on 2 L nasal cannula.  Her laboratory values revealed WBCs 15.1, Hb 14.4, HCT 43.4, PLT 321, neutrophils 68.8%, D-dimer 4642, NA 134, K3.4, anion gap 9, BUN 17, creatinine 1.00, glucose 163, troponin elevated 0.12, 0.25, and 0.41, urinalysis is unremarkable, COVID-19 swab is positive. A thrombectomy was performed 2/16/2021.  She tested COVID positive on 2/16/2021 and her SpO2 remains in the high 90s with dips to mid 80s while talking, but she does not currently experience any SOB.

                                                TIA; Left upper lip is turned down/face does not look normal; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (TIA) and FACIAL PARALYSIS (Left upper lip is turned down/face does not look normal) in an 85-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 031M20A and 010M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure abnormal.  Concomitant products included METOPROLOL for an unknown indication.   On 30-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form.  On 27-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form.   On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (TIA) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and FACIAL PARALYSIS (Left upper lip is turned down/face does not look normal) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was hospitalized for 3 days due to TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. At the time of the report, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (TIA) and FACIAL PARALYSIS (Left upper lip is turned down/face does not look normal) outcome was unknown.       For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments  Other concomitant medications included unspecified blood pressure medications.  No treatment information reported.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.   This case was linked to US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-081470 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist,  the event  of Transient ischemic attack with facial paralysis is confounded by the patient&#39;s history of Blood pressure abnormal and advanced age.

                                                Sudden presentation of Ecoli bladder infection with numerous clotting and emergency catheterization.  Have not had prior UTIs that I am aware of.  Urologist doesn&#39;t see any possible correlation but I am now on a third round of antibiotics.  Three days after my second shot on 3/12/2021 bleeding again started so now am now back on antibiotics.

                                                Patient went to have labs done for her leukemia checkup 3/24. Patient has had leukemia for many years and has had many blood draws. Patient had blood taken at her appointment and was waiting when the nurse came back out and said her blood had clotted so they needed to redraw her blood. She states this has never happened before and wondered if her blood clotting would have been due to her covid vaccine the week prior. She states the first girl who drew her blood was slower than the second time around when a different nurse drew her blood.

She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.

She knew she did not have macular degeneration as it centers it.  Sometimes it sparkles and has grain to it.  He said that she had an arterial blood, and that leaked from the carotid artery into the eye has not completely sealed off.  She can see out of the right eye perfectly, but she cannot see a little out of the left eye.  If she&#39;s watching the TV she can see the top of the newscasters hair, but she cannot see anything below that.  Her vision is upward either, can see out of either side, but cannot below horizontal down.  He told her that it was basically a stroke that didn&#39;t reach her brain and went to her eye.  He told her to return to see him (ophthalmologist) on 5/18/21 at 10:00 AM.  She also is to see her PCP on 5/20/21.

Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time. Please see MDM section and the rest of the note for further information on patient assessment and treatment.
