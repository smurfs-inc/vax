                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

Critical care was necessary to treat or prevent imminent or life-threatening deterioration of the following conditions: cardiac failure, circulatory failure, CNS failure or compromise, dehydration, hepatic failure, endocrine crisis, metabolic crisis, renal failure, sepsis, respiratory failure, shock, toxidrome and trauma.  I provided critical care services requiring my management in the following manner: chart data review, documentation time, medication orders and management, re-evaluations, vital signs assessments and reviewing monitor data, and ordering and reviewing lab tests.  Aggregate Critical care time was 30 minutes.  My time did not include minutes spent treating any other patient simultaneously or on activities that did not directly contribute to the patient&#39;s treatment.  It did not include time spent performing other reported procedures.  Medical Decision Making:  This is a 76-year-old female who presented ER today for evaluation of syncope.  Patient was reportedly mildly hypotensive which improved with IV fluids.  I suspect that patient had dehydration given 4 episodes of large watery stools.  Patient had no recent antibiotic use and has no C. difficile risk factors, suspect this may be related to her Covid vaccine, she had no evidence to suggest anaphylactic shock, patient felt better after IV fluid bolus was able to ambulate around the emergency department without lightheadedness or near syncope.  She had troponins x2 which were negative, her EKG was nonischemic and there was no evidence of ectopy or arrhythmia.  Patient did have syncope and fell onto her side, she denies discrete head injury although patient is anticoagulated, CT head was obtained to rule out intracranial hemorrhage given the syncopal event.  Patient CT abd/pelvix was negative for obvious cause of patient&#39;s abdominal tenderness may be related to her diarrheal illness patient will be prescribed Bentyl.  She will call her primary care doctor in the morning to arrange close follow-up.  She understands need for aggressive oral hydration at home.  She will have low threshold to return should she develop lightheadedness syncope chest pain shortness of breath palpitations worsening abdominal pain bloody or dark stools any new or concerning symptoms.  The patient presented to the emergency department with potentially life or limb-threatening symptoms.      After my history, examination, and workup have decided that the patient is stable.    My impression is that they are safe to go home at this time.  I have reviewed ED return precautions with the patient. They understand to return if they are concerned for any reason.   They will follow-up with their PCP in 1-2 days.        Impression:  Syncope, hypotensionimproved, dehydration  Plan:   Discharge   Follow Up    Within: 1-2 days    Comments: Please call your doctor in the morning to arrange follow-up with your primary care doctor in the next 24 hours.  Please stay well-hydrated and eat regular meals.  Please take Bentyl as needed for abdominal cramping with diarrhea.  Please return to the ER if you develop worsening abdominal pain, feelings of lightheadedness passing out any new or concerning symptoms.

                                                VACCINE received on Friday 1/15/2021 afternoon; Monday evening 1/18/2021 felt slight chills; early to bed. Tuesday AM awoke with severe &#39;bed-rocking&#39; chills, nausea and fever 100-101 degrees. recommended I go to Hospital ER.  At ER, temperature increased to 102 degrees.  Covid test was negative, but cost X-ray showed reasons to suspect pneumonia. No one suggested I was just suffering acute reaction to vaccine.  Returned home w/ prescription for doxycycline hyclate and request that I return to the ER the next day if I continued to feel ill.  The next morning, 1/19/21, I again awoke with intense, somewhat frightening chills, vomiting and a mild fever.  As instructed I returned to the ER.  Assuming the COVID Test may have been a false negative, a second one was given; it too turned out to be negative, but I remained at the ER and then admitted to Hospital to remain under observation.  Im the hospital the chills, nausea and fever came to an end, but acute headache and utter fatigue lasted until I was released on Jan 22.  My discharge papers indicated no further signs of pneumonia or any other infection; my attending doctor, concluded that my experience was an unusually strong (and delayed) reaction to the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 025LZ0A) intramuscularly in her right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient experienced heart beating very fast and feeling uncomfortable; it lasted for a few hours. She stated it was atrial fibrillation, she had a diagnosis of this, and it only lasted a few hours. The patient also stated that her blood glucose was 150, which was higher than normal.  Treatment for the events was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, increased blood sugar, was considered not resolved. The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and feeling uncomfortable, was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76 year-old female patient with a significant medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and non-serious unexpected events of Discomfort and Blood glucose increased. The events occurred one day (same day) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 025LZ0A. Treatment was not reported. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes were considered strong confounders.

                                                The patient had her second Moderna shot on Feb 17, 2021. At 3 am the next morning she reported to the ED c/o being &#34;fluish&#34; and short of breath. She was found to be hypoxic to the upper 80&#39;s on RA, and a CXR was consistent with CHF.  She stated she had some off and on chest pain for the last few weeks, especially with exertion. Ultimately it was found that she had an elevated troponin and was felt to have had an MI. She underwent cardiac cath and a stent was placed in a 95% ostial right coronary stenosis.   Although she was reported as having had a &#34;hyperimmune&#34; response to the vaccine, I can only say for certain she had flash pulmonary edema due to cardiac ischemia that was due to a stenosis in her RCA that had been there for quite some time, but possibly just happened to become critical right after her second COVID vaccine. It would be hard to blame the vaccine, but it is also impossible I guess to absolve it from any role in her MI.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

                                                Pneumonia in left lung; Pain in neck; Acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her body; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 78 year old female who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body, pneumonia in her left lung and neck pain.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included non specified medication for blood pressure, calming down, dementia and thyroid.   On 04 Jan 2021, approximately 2.5 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 04 Jan 2021, the patient developed acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body that lasted ten days. The patient also experienced neck pain. On an unknown date, she was treated in the emergency room for pneumonia in her left lung and given antibiotics. She later followed up with her primary care doctor and additional x-rays were taken and she was treated with prednisone.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, acute pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body, was considered resolved on 14 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, pain neck was resolved on 19 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, pneumonia in left lung, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Company Comment: This case concerns a 78-year-old female patient who experienced unexpected serious event of pneumonia and non-serious event of acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body and neck pain.  The event developed on the same day after the first dose and only dose of the vaccine mRNA-1273 vaccine (lot # unknown, expiration date-unknown).  Although a temporal association exist between the event of pneumonia and the administration of the vaccine, in the absence of clinical details including diagnostic test, a definite diagnosis was not established. The events of acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body and neck pain are also temporarily associated with vaccine administration and a causal association cannot be excluded. Main field defaults to possibly related&#39; for all events.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Pleasant 78-year-old female with history of lung cancer with remote partial pneumonectomy, some element of COPD and chronic respiratory failure on home oxygen therapy. She presents with worsening shortness of breath, which started rather abruptly the day prior to presentation. On arrival to the ED she was mildly tachypneic and slightly tachycardic and appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. Her O2 had been titrated to 4 L/m nasal cannula in order to sustain SaO2 values in the 90% or above range. Patient also noted to have pallor. No hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, fever, cough or known exposure to COVID. Patient reports having received her first COVID vaccination just over one 1 week ago. A hypochromic microcytic anemia, progressive, was noted with a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Patient reported that she was up-to-date on EGD and colonoscopy within the past year without findings of acute pathology or bleeding. A CTA of the chest was conducted with findings of bilateral pulmonary emboli. She denies lower extremity swelling, pain or tenderness. Patient placed in observation in order to provide palliative blood replacement therapy and commence with anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism.  DISCHARGE SUMMARY/OBSERVATION COURSE: Uneventful observation course for this pleasant 78-year-old female who presented with somewhat sudden worsening of her chronic shortness of breath and was found to have CTA evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli. This in the setting of a progressive iron deficiency anemia without evidence of active clinical gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells in a palliative fashion for her presenting hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Posttransfusion hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dL. Concurrently, she was placed on weight-based low molecular weight heparin for full anticoagulation. I examined the patient on the morning of February 12 and found her to be nondistressed. Her SaO2 value was 96% on 4 L/m nasal cannula O2. Recall that her baseline flow rate historically had been 2 L/m his cannula. Etiology of the patient&#39;s thromboembolism uncertain. She had no clinical findings of unilateral or bilateral lower extremity swelling or tenderness. Patient noted to be a survivor of both breast and lung cancers but without known evidence of active persistent malignancy. Of interest, she had received a COVID-19 vaccine just over one week prior to presentation. I contacted pharmacy in this regard and encouraged him to report possible adverse event via VAERS. I recommended a course of rivaroxaban and provided a prescription with a VTE dosing schedule. Patient was advised to followup with Dr in 10 days.  M.D., Hospital Medicine    MD Feb 12, 2021 08:40

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications were reported.    On 19-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 032L20a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 19-Feb-2021, the patient received the vaccine around noon and by the evening she could tell things were going downhill. She went to bed early, and throughout the night the injection site was painful, she was fatigued, she had muscle pain, joint pain, nausea without vomiting, and a low grade fever. The patient got up at night to go to the bathroom and got dizzy and passed out. She said she was passed our for barely a minute and when she came too she laid there for a bit before she went back to bed with her husband&#39;s help. All day on Saturday 20-Feb-2021 the patient was in bed but by that evening she was able to get up and walk out of the bedroom. On Sunday night 21-Feb-2021, she was able walk up stairs without huffing and puffing and felt much better. The patient states they have recovered from it all except sometimes when doing yoga, they can feel a bit of an ache in the injection arm.  No treatment information was provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event(s); therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event(s) is not applicable.  The outcome of the events things were going downhill, injection site was painful, fatigued, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea without vomiting, low grade fever, dizzy, and passed out, were considered recovered/resolved.    The outcome of the event, ache in injection arm, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 79 Y/O F with a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness along with NS unexpected dizziness, feeling abnormal, pain in extremity, and NS expected fever, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vaccination site pain. Event onset the same day as second dose mRNA-1273. Events resolved except arm pain. Based on current available information and temporal association between use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient came with husband to Vaccine clinic today 3/5 for 2nd dose of vaccine. Did well during and immediately after vaccine. Husband states patient has c/o severe chest pressure and pain for several weeks but has refused to come to ER for evaluation. Today, after getting vaccine dose and going to local bank, patient was in passenger side of truck when chest pain started again. Husband begged patient to let him take her to the ER but she said no, I?m fine and I don?t want to go. She then went unresponsive. At a stop light, he was next to a couple of cops who he was able to wave down and proceed to escort them in to ER. Upon arrival to the ER, patient was unresponsive and pulseless. CPR was initiated, 1 defib, and 1mg of epi was given. Return of pulse was obtained, but husband asked for no life support and only comfort measures. Patient was admitted for comfort measures.  I do NOT think this was related to her vaccine, but rather the unfortunately end to a sub-acute chest pain patient that declined multiple urgings to seek care.  Patient then expired on 3/5/21 at 2037.

Brief History and Hospital Course:  Patient is a/an 79 y.o. female with a past history significant for HTN, HLD, and DM who presented to facility on 3/9/2021 with complaints of severe 8/10 right jaw pain lasting 3 minutes. EKG with new left BBB and troponin mildly elevated 8-17-35-26. She was seen by Cardiology and determined to have NSTEMI and taken for cardiac cath with drug eluting stent placed to LAD. Echo was also ordered with evidence of murmur. Cavity size is normal. Wall thickness is normal. Systolic function is normal. The estimated ejection fraction is 55%. Dyssynchronous interventricular septal motion, likely related to conduction abnormality/bundle branch block. Grade I diastolic dysfunction. Annulus is severely calcified. Severely calcified and restricted opening of posterior mitral leaflet. Mild mitral valve stenosis at the max.  She remained stable post stent placement. She remained on dual antiplatelet therapy

On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My mom received her second covid shot at 10:05 AM on 3/26 and experienced no adverse symptoms. At around 6 am the following day, on the morning of 3/27 she was found on the floor, and presumably suffered from a heart attack. After devastation to our family, we called her physician and he himself was also surprised. Although she is a type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure she has maintained great health and kept her conditions under control with her medications. This, unfortunately, seems too coincidental to not have been in some way or completely caused by the second dose of the shot.

                                                Had a stroke; A spontaneous report was received from a caregiver concerning an 81-years-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine and had a stroke.  Patient&#39;s medical history included a mini stroke (5-6 years ago). Concomitant medication included blood thinners.  On 02 Feb 2021 at 4:30 pm, ten days prior to onset of the event stroke, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot/batch: unknown) for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient had an event of stroke for which was hospitalized. The patient was on a lot of medications (not specified).   Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not recorded.  The outcome of the event stroke was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of stroke, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s elderly age and prior history of TIA are considered as risk factors.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 07 Jan 2021, approximately 6 hours prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 07 Jan 2021 at 19:30, the patient fainted. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, fainted, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 82 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Syncope. The event occurred 6 hours after first dose of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I video chatted with her Thursday after receiving the vaccine. My mom was in poor health but she was talking in complete sentences and responded appropriately. She was upright in bed and made eye contact. She smiled and denied pain. By Sunday, she was extremely weak and unable to sip water with a straw. Her health had changed dramatically and rapidly. She moaned in pain and was very fatigued. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the week and she stopped talking and was constantly sleeping. They started antibiotics for the oozing cancer lesion and then morphine for pain and end of life care. She passed away on January 22nd which was 15 days post vaccination.

Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.

When asked what her sx were, she stated fatigue.  She was well the night of the shot, Thur. and Fri. but became tired on Sat. and Sun.  I went through other sx with her such as h/a, fever, n/v, muscle aches, weakness and she said she experienced none of those.  I questioned her about eating and drinking and she said she ate and drank water.  She seemed fine so I told her to call her doctor if she was worse or the fatigue persisted or call 911.  She agreed.  Two staff from clinic called her Mon. and Tues, (1/18 and 1/19).  On Tues. she may have had sl slurred speech.  She was found deceased on

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

I am not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but the rapid antigen for Sars-CoV2 was positive and the PCR was negative.  I am reporting this event because of the lack of clarity on this issue and the positivity of the Sars-CoV2 was beyond the parameters of 14 days in the phase three trials.

That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again.

The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021.

                                                The following day, food did not taste as it should and water tasted like metal.  By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

                                                Within a few days, my mother started reporting profound fatigue and shortness of breath while conducting routine household activities. She no longer had to energy for her daily exercise walks and became increasingly lethargic. She died in her sleep while taking an afternoon nap on Thursday, February 4th. I am highly concerned this could be a vaccine related.

I talked with the husband briefly about why his wife was hospitalized. He reported she got sick 2 days after getting her first COVID-19 vaccine. He states she had pneumonia, had a urinary tract infection and had to have a heart catherization with stent placement. We moved her second vaccine appointment to February 17th. The spouse came in on February 8th for his 2nd dose. He told me the doctors did not believe his wife&#39;s hospitalization was related to the first COVID vaccine and he said the doctor&#39;s told him that she needed her 2nd dose.

She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.  She flat lined at the hospital and her body went into shock.  She ended up having Kidney, Heart and Liver Failure.  She was still driving and doing all of her cooking, banking, shopping, showering, walking every day on Feb 18th.  She died on March 5th.

There is additional subdural hemorrhage layering along the left frontal, temporal and parietal convexity which may be decompressing from the area of intraparenchymal hematoma. No visualized intraventricular hemorrhage.There is some trace hemorrhage layering along the left tentorium cerebelli. Severe associated mass effect with left-to-right midline shift of 2.1 cm. There is subfalcine and downward transtentorial herniation with complete effacement of the basilar cisterns. Evaluation of the craniocervical junction is limited due to beam hardening artifact. Near-complete effacement of the left lateral ventricle.  No head trauma or fall.  Deceased 1/26/2021

She stated that the evening after the patient received the vaccine, she felt some mild injection site pain.  The morning after, the patient reported severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting.  The patients daughter then called her physician to report these symptoms and attributed them as an adverse reaction to the vaccine at that time.  These symptoms were intermittent for one week and no other adverse reactions were noted.  In the early morning hours of 1/27/2021, the patient was toileting and had expired while doing so.  An ambulance was called and cause of death was not found. An autopsy was not performed.

Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time. Please see MDM section and the rest of the note for further information on patient assessment and treatment.   PE:   VITAL SIGNS:   BP: 126/75   Pulse: (!) 122   Resp: (!) 40   SpO2: (!) 82 %   Temp: 98.1 °F (36.7 °C)   Height: 5&#39; 8&#34; (172.7 cm)   Weight: 152 lb (68.9 kg) General:  Alert, nontoxic, in no acute distress.
