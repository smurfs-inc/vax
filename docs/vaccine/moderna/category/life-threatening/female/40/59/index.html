She also developed a fever during the day.  She did not seek treatment until Sunday and went to Hospital ED.  She was treated and released same day.  She went back to hospital on Monday as she felt worse and she was admitted at that time and treated for a bloodstream infection and meningitis.  We are not sure it was caused by the vaccine.  She consulted her PCP and her PCP feels it may be more coincidental given her medical HX.

The patient&#39;s medical history included a propensity for fainting and low blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient got dizzy, had nausea, a little vomit, and fainted to the floor. She reported feeling dizzy, hot and sweaty.  Patient did not take medication to treat her symptoms.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, fainted, dizziness, felt hot, nausea and vomiting, and sweaty were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 40-year-old female patient with medical history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the unlisted event of Syncope which was considered medically significant. Additionally, the patient experienced the non-serious listed events of Nausea and Vomiting, and the non-serious unlisted events of Feeling Hot, Dizziness and Hyperhidrosis. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. We would note that the patient&#39;s history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure could be also contributory.

                                                I received the injection around 2:15 pm.  There were no immediate effects. By late afternoon/early evening, my arm was a bit sore and later started to feel warm near the injection site.  However, I otherwise felt fine.  At 9 pm, I suddenly became very dizzy and passed out for several minutes. When I regained consciousness, I felt a little short of breath, which resolved within 20 minutes or so. However, I was also extremely nauseous, which got worse any time I tried to move. This continued for several hours.  I also alternated between being very warm and chills during this time - it was like waves of heat. I did not have a fever. Later, my head began to hurt and I took tylenol to help with that. I also had diarrhea. These symptoms began to gradually lessen after a couple of hours and I was able to fall asleep around 12:30 pm. I woke up hot and sweaty several times throughout the night. The following day, 1/6, I was very tired and had a headache and could not eat much, but otherwise felt much better.

                                                Shot 1 given Dec 29 in the morning. I had no symptoms. I got very sick at about 4:30pm Symptoms: muscle aches, chills, fever, headache, SOB, chest pain, sore throat, cough. I ended in the ED because I couldn?t manage my asthma and my HR was high on Wed. I was diagnosed with Covid as I found out my husband gave it to me. Then a couple days later my asthma got worse and I ended up in the ED overnight. They were able to get better management in my Asthma.  I was sick for 3 weeks. Went back to work week four 1/25 Monday and 1/27 they cleared me to get the second dosage of the vaccine. I got the vaccine 3:20 pm and at 5:00 I walked my son in Kung Fu and then waited in my car. I ended up passing out in my car at approx 5:15 pm and my 8 year old son knew something was wrong and had to wake me up.  I could barely drive home I felt very drunk. When I got home my temp spikes to 101.3. I had extreme muscle pain, fatigue, chills, sore throat, chest pain, cough, SOB. My left arm swelled up where I was injected and I couldn?t move my arm. I was told I couldn?t take anything tylonel or Ibuprofen for 8 hours. I suffered. Even when I could take something my body was very painful. This lasted  wed, thurs, and Friday morning.

                                                I immediately got a headache after the shot and became dizzy several hours later. I went to bed around 9 pm and then woke up around 10 am and was very dizzy and my arm was in severe pain. I had to vomit so I got out of bed and fainted and fell to the floor. I got up again and then fainted and hit the floor. My husband then called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.

                                                In the middle of the night I passed out while walking from the bathroom. I broke my front tooth in half and smashed in 2 other front teeth. Also bruised cheek, lip, and knee. I had been feeling chills, aches, and flu-like symptoms throughout the night. It required a dental surgeon, dentist, and probably braces. The advice nurse advised going to the Emergency Room due to her concern about a head injury.

                                                I felt very heavy (especially my limbs) and had a slight headache on Thursday (the day after receiving the vaccine).  This feeling continued into Friday morning when I nearly passed out (blacked out and collapsed for a split second) as I was crouched position for approximately 10 minutes at work.  I felt dizzy and slow moving for the next several hours.  My blood pressure was rated as normal, blood oxygen normal, and pulse slightly low by a nurse on staff who took my vitals after the episode.   My temperature, which had been 97.8 prior to the event that morning (typical for me) was elevated during this time to 100.2 and returned to normal after approximately 4 hours without medication.  I was fatigued, so I slept for approximately 4-5 hours that afternoon and began feeling better the following day (Saturday).

Got up at 6:30 am today (2/11/21), used the bathroom, felt very dizzy and lightheaded, started sweating profusely, tried to make it back to bed, took 4 steps and passed out, hitting my face on dresser.  This has only happened one other time, 16 years ago when I was pregnant, flying on vacation and hadn?t eaten, blood sugar dropped and I passed out momentarily. No history of fainting, not diabetic, no health issues whatsoever. Healthy weight, fit and in shape.

                                                The patient had a previous reaction to a flu vaccine.  She was treated for Bell&#39;s Palsy related to the flu vaccine 3 years ago.  The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

                                                During the 15 minute observation following the 1st Moderna vaccine dose, the patient reported her tongue &#39;felt thick,&#39; flushed skin, redness on face, neck, hands, BP=98/60, HR=100.  Patient felt &#39;jittery&#39; and &#39;heart racing.&#39;  Was transferred to ED for evaluation given that patient reported her tongue &#39;getting tighter.&#39;  In the ED, the patient was treated with diphenhydramine 25mg x 2 doses, methylprednisolone 125mg x 1 dose, famotidine 20mg x 1 dose, and NS IV fluids.  Hypoglycemia was ruled out with CBG=87.  The physician avoided treatment with epinephrine due to it being listed on her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;shortness of breath.&#39;  Symptoms resolved over the next 3 hours.  The patient was discharged home with a new prescription of oral prednisone taper.  Subsequent follow-up with her primary care provider, in consultation with an ID provider, recommended that this patient NOT get a 2nd dose.  Covid-19 vaccine was added to her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;anaphylaxis.&#39;

I have never fainted before in my life.  I was out for about 2-3 minutes.

                                                2am woke up with severe chills and a severe migraine. At 10am severe migraine progressed to skin on scalp feeling like it was pulled too tight. From there I began to feel an internal tremor in my head, almost like if you ran a jack hammer all day and then stopped, that shaky, off-kilter feeling.  I used the bathroom that morning and had massive diarrhea, experience a vaso/syncope episode and passed out.  All week I felt like this and experienced nausea, dizziness, heart palpitations, severe migraine, internal tremor, severe anxiety and severe thirst.  By Friday, 2/26/21, it got so bad and my blood pressure dropped to 112/50, that I was taken via ambulance to the ER.  They gave me IV fluids, ran labs, EKG, etc.  Blood pressure went up to 137/91.  Released to rehab at home.  2nd ER visit to Hospital on Sunday where they repeated labs, EKG, gave me fluids and treated symptoms. Both trips I was labeled Tachy.

                                                Have had tiredness since 2nd vaccine in February and noticed shortness of breath when walking or going up stairs in mid March.  Around 4/1, I started having left rib pain preventing me from sleeping on my left side and then could not breath during a massage on 4/8.   On April 9th, I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms (clots) in both lungs, reducing my lung capacity to only 30% of normal.  This could be due to Loestrin birth control but I have taken hormones in the past for IVF and when younger for birth control.  The reaction may be due to a combination of vaccine, Loestrin and iron but triggered by vaccine.  I am currently on Eliquis to treat pulmonary embolisms.

Pt admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation secondary to angioedema from Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. Pt presented with a chief complaint of tongue and facial swelling approximately 10 minutes after receiving first dose of the vaccination. She did not respond to Benadryl or IM epinephrine. She was admitted to ICU and intubated. She was started on IVsteroids, famotidine and diphenhydramine. Swelling gradually improved and she was successfully extubated.  Her hospital course was complicated by steroid-induced hyperglycemia requiring insulin.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 20 Jan 2021 at 18:00, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection, the patient began to have tongue swelling. She was given diphenhydramine and epinephrine by epi pen. She went to the emergency room where she displayed symptoms including a fast heart rate, wheezing, and shortness of breath with an angioedema or anaphylaxis like appearance. She was given more epinephrine, famotidine, scheduled diphenhydramine at 50 QAs intravenously (IV), IV steroids, was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She was on the ventilator for approximately 18-20 hours following admission. She eventually responded to a high dose of dexamethasone. She was also given duonebs for her shortness of breath, regular sedation for the ventilator, and a dose of ketorolac. Consent was given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events were unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred approximately 10 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration. She was treated with epinephrine, famotidine, diphenhydramine, IV steroids, intubated and placed on a ventilator.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It was sore from my neck down to just below my elbow. I began having chills and a low grade temp shortly after that. by 0130, I was dizzy, experiencing diarrhea, with episodes of diaphoresis, and acute nausea. I felt that I had some postural hypotension, was very pale and every time I would get up to walk I felt like I was going to end up on the ground. I remained in bed for approx. 16 hours before I felt like I comfortable even getting up and going to restroom. I still have intermittent dizziness, with syncope to this date.  I had to leave work early as well as calling in sick for the next shift.

                                                My left arm, where I received the shot, began hurting after a few hours. Approximately 12 hours after receiving the shot, fatigue began. Approximately two hours later, I was unable to walk, I collapsed on the floor, my heart was racing, I was sweating, my entire body went numb, and there was ringing and static in my ears. After about 20 minutes on the floor, I got back into bed. My fingers and hands wanted to curl up and not open and that lasted throughout the night. My arms and legs stayed numb all night long.  At around 24 hours post vaccine, the numbness started to subside, I could open my fingers and hands, and regular flu symptoms were present (fatigue, body aches, low grade fever). I could not work the day after receiving the shot. I slept all day. I was not able to drive until around 5PM the day after receiving the shot. The second night and throughout the following day (so 36-48&#43; hours post shot), I had cold sweats. It is now 3 days later and I still feel terrible. I am worried about getting the second Moderna shot.

Around 4:15 am I got up to use the restroom and I passed out.  My husband was able to get me to regain consciousness.  I then passed out again after about 10 minutes.  We then went to the ER because I had a laceration on my eye,and head pain from hitting my night stand, wall, and floor.

                                                I had Covid-19 in December 2020. On the following day of my first vaccine, in the middle of the night, I experienced chills, body aches. At 7am the next day I woke up feeling light headed and passed out. When I woke up I had thrown up on myself and started to hear a whooshing sound in my ears and I went back to bed. At 9am my symptoms started all over again. I live with my house maid and since I did not look well, she took me to urgent care. My BP had dropped and I was super dizzy. I got an IV drip for an hour, anti-nausea medication. My blood was also drawn and found to have underlying anemia. My urine test was negative. The pulse oximetry was fine and by the next day I slowly started to feel better.

                                                Initially there were severe flu like symptoms: chills, shaking, headache &amp; body aches, fatigue starting apx 2 hours following. These continued until apx 24 hours later when additional mental fog set it, difficulty focusing attention, lethargy, trouble walking, dizziness then brief loss of consciousness occurred, extreme difficulty staying awake. I was taken to the emergency room where additional tests were done due to &#34;stroke- like&#34; symptoms.  Tests were okay with hospital staff reporting that likely/only known cause was the COVID  vaccine given the day before. Symptoms have gradually reduced but occasional mental fog, occasional dizzy spells &amp; chronic fatigue persist.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

                                                Nurse did hit a capillary and I bled immediately after injection- enough where it ran down my arm and went onto floor. I felt pretty okay except for the feeling of my arm hot and fuzzy and fuzzy fingers on my left hand until my &#34;leave time&#39; of 10:03 am. I stayed a little longer, and was home by 10:30 when I became extremely nauseous, dry heaving, left side of face numb. Headache started at 10:40. Tried calling medical facility but was on hold for soo long- no one answered so since I don&#39;t have insurance I decided to just rest and drink fluids. By 11:40 my face was back to normal, no longer nauseous but extremely lethargic and was the rest of the day. The following day I felt ok -slight swelling on my arm at injection site and a bruise that I still have.

The day after that my left left began swelling for no reason, was slightly discolored and warm to the touch. As the week went on my shortness of breath became greater and my leg more swollen. On (3/26/21) I sent to the ER by my doctor. Had a ultra sound and discovered an extensive DVT in my left groin down to behind left knee. Had a CT and discovered blood clots in my lungs. I had never had any underlying health conditions or been on medications, don&#39;t smoke, no complaints prior. Was transported to hospital spent 2.5 days in ICU before being moved to a regular bed for a total of (4) days hospitalized. The doctor installed two sheaths on each side of groin, injected my lungs with medication to blast/dissolve the clots and installed a filter in the main artery to catch any clots that may break away from leg. I was also put on a Heparin drip while in ICU. The next day the doctor went and the procedure was a success dissolving the clots. He removed the sheaths. I went back to ICU. The next day (3/28/21) a second utlra sound was done to left leg and DVT is still in left leg. Have been described Eliquis blood thinner.

                                                Became nauseous and started vomiting approximately 20 minutes after the vaccine. She initially refused to go to the emergency room by ambulance. The vomiting continued and she then passed out and became diaphoretic. 911 was called and she was transported to the emergency room. I later spoke with a nurse at the ER and tests were being ran. She said they did not feel it was vaccine related. She did say the doctor said she had a panic attack.

Her husband reported she had not unexpected fatigue,  malaise, and fever for 1 day but better after that.  On Monday she began complaining of shortness of breath.  This progressively worsened and she started having presyncopal episodes.  On Saturday she was unable to come down the stairs in the house so husband planned to take her to the hospital but she stood up and passed out and woke up quickly.  He decided to call EMS.  By the time she presented to our hospital she was cyanotic and agonal breathing.  On moving her from EMS stretcher to ED bed she had PEA cardiac arrest.  She underwent mechanical device CPR with only brief (&lt;1 min) ROSC x1.  She at some point did have a shockable rhythm.  Cath lab was notified and she was taken emergently to the cath lab with ongoing mechanical device CPR.  Peripheral VA ECMO was placed after about 1.5 hours.  Pulmonary angiogram was done which showed massive saddle PE with near complete obliteration of the right pulmonary tree and some filling defects in the left tree as well.  At that time she had severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 24.  She also had no gag or corneal reflex, minimally responsive pupils, and no response to noxious stimuli.  Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted with some result.  She was transferred to the SICU with increasing pressor requirement, and DIC.  Ultimately, the venous catheter of the ECMO circuit malfunctioned thought to be secondary propagating IVC thrombosis.  Family decided to withdraw care and she passed away.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving injection in right arm I felt a BOOM flush all over my body like I just had an IV Contrast.  Then I became dizzy, my heart started racing, I started cold sweats and felt tightness in my mid upper chest to the base of my throat.  The ED RN on site took my BP and HR and had me lie down because I felt that I couldn&#39;t breath.  She called paramedics who took my BP and HR, then did a 12 lead EKG.  They transported me to the ED.  I was worked up for cardiac, lung, chemistry.  My troponin-HS was slightly elevated and a cardiologist was called.  He did an echo on my heart, liver and right kidney -- normal.  Chest X-ray was normal.  A second 12 lead EKG was done, normal sinus.  Hematology, Chemistry was normal.  Was in the ED from 11:30 to 4:00 p.m.  Advised by ED Doctor, and Cardiologist, that it seems the stress of the anaphylaxis reaction stressed the heart which caused the spill of troponin.  Advised to see my cardiologist and get a stress test.  I have already informed my Primary Care Doctor and he has prescribed me an EPI-PEN to carry.  I have no history of allergic reactions/anaphylaxis reactions to vaccines.  I am up to date with all other vaccines and just had my yearly flu shot in November 2020.  This was my first allergic reaction/anaphylaxis reaction to a vaccine.

                                                2/5 I received the 1st does of Moderna. The next day I had a massive headache. As the days went on my neck started to heart. The days continued and my back started to hurt. I thought my pain was just radiating down my back from my neck. ON 2/12 I have record of going to the pharmacy to get Lidocain patches. I continued on with pain from neck to middle of back. I made appointments with chiropractor and went there complaining that my back and ribs were out. This continued. On 3/5 I got the 2nd dose. I reacted as expected but this went on for 4 days. Went to a convenient care clinic where the dr ordered chest xray and D-DImer for suspected PEs. I got a call immediately to go to ER as my D-Dimer was high at 4.3. I went back to Local ER and had a CT Scan. The CT scan showed MULTIPLE PEs with infarct. I was admitted. SInce then I have been back to the ER and still struggling and have many tests coming up. My pulse is consistantly tachycardia. The ER docs do not want to entertain the thought that is was the vaccine because i was a smoker and on hormone replacement therapy. HOWEVER, I smoked for over 30 years and was on that HRT for almost 3 and never showed any signs of a clotting issue. I can pinpoint with pictures, and bank records of when the pain started and it reflects back to the 1st dose.  Who knows but after the 2nd does and out of the hospital I struggled with covid symptoms including the &#34;foggy&#34; head and that continues as well as other health related PE issues.  They may not want to contribute it to the vaccine but I know when this all started and it does need to be reported incase others. I have a whole story to tell that doesn&#39;t cover in writing!

                                                I went to bed Friday night around 10:00PM.  I woke around 12:30AM with a throbbing headache, sore throat, post-nasal drainage, body aches, chills, fever, sweating, weakness and nausea.  I went down to use the bathroom and then back to bed but could not sleep due to the throbbing headache and chills.  I got back up around 2:30AM and soaked in a warm bath.  I went back to bed around 4:30AM.  I was able to go to sleep.  I slept until around 8:30AM.  At that time, I drank some water and went back to sleep.  I slept until approximately 10:30AM and started drinking Powerade Zero.  The Powerade was taken to bed and sipped on when I would stir and change positions.  I slept until approximately 2:30PM, when I got up to use the bathroom.  I urinated, washed my hands and went to walk out of the bathroom when everything went black.  I remember yelling for my husband but then nothing else until I heard him yell my name several times and I was lying on the floor in the doorway of the bathroom.  I passed out.  I was sat up in the recliner and monitored.  Above symptoms continued.  Tylenol and Motrin were alternated every 4 hours for the fever.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; Scratchy throat; Pain-near injection site; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 48-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced anaphylactic reaction, scratchy throat and pain near the injection site.  The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID-19. Concomitant product use was not provided.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20-2A) on 06 Jan 2021 in the left arm intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Jan 2021, almost immediately after receiving the vaccine the patient reported having a scratchy throat and pain near the injection site. She stated she spoke with her health care provider who advised her she was having an anaphylactic reaction.  Treatment for the event included Benadryl.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events anaphylactic reaction, scratchy throat and pain near the injection site were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 48-year-old female patient. The patient experienced an unexpected event of Anaphylactic Reaction that was considered medically significant, and an unexpected non-serious event of Scratchy throat along with an expected non-serious event of pain near the injection site. The events occurred almost immediately after receiving first dose of first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 039K20-2A) in the left arm intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Treatment included Benadryl. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I slept all weekend.  After shot two (right arm) on 02/05/21 I had all of those same reactions by early Friday afternoon. I woke up at 10:00 pm with the need to vomit. While sitting on the edge of my bath tub waiting to vomit, I fainted and fell backwards into the bathtub, hitting me head and wrenching my neck as I was wedged into the tub sideways. My son found me and roused me. I then urinated all over myself, had extreme diarrhea and vomiting x 2 rounds. I fainted a second time while sitting on the toilet with diarrhea and vomited 2x more into my bathtub.

                                                7 AM 3/25/2021 - Patient called out to husband from the bathroom where she experienced a syncopal event, then passed out.  An ambulance was called and she was revived for a short period of time.  She was taken to Hospital where she coded 3 times.  She was then life-flighted to second Hospital.  According to the hospital records, tests conducted over the course of several days determined that she had no neurological activity.  Initial reports in the records indicate pulmonary embolism, cardiac and respiratory arrest.  She was on life support for the remainder of her time.  Organ donation is being pursued at present and results of this are pending at time of this report submission.  Date of death is unknown until organ retrieval is accomplished.  Family will be contacted in the next few days to ask further questions about any other kinds of vaccine-related reactions that may have happened more immediately to days after the vaccination on 3/17/2021.  A co-worker thought that she had shortness of breath for 3-4 days before this critical event occurred on 3/25/2021.

                                                Woke up on 4/4 with a golf ball sized, raised welt at the injection site. It was hot and very red. The next day, it was even larger, by 4/7, it had completely gone away.  Everyone thinks I should also mention that I was admitted to the hospital with chest pain, high BP/Pulse on 3/31, they did a D-Dimer on me and it was elevated, suggesting a clot has formed and is in the process of breaking down. I had a CT of my chest and no PE was found, but I had thickening of my left lobar pulmonary artery wall, further supporting the suggestion of a possible blood clot. After an echo stress test, I was discharged the next day on HTN meds. I was experiencing chest discomfort prior to my vaccine, but again, EVERYONE is telling me I need to report this, so I am. :)

Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Patient observed for 4 hours and seemed to improve so discharged.

                                                Patient information was reviewed. Patient was asked if they ever had any form of severe reaction to anything they had had in the past. Patient did not state yes to anything other than having a reaction that was managed at home to shellfish as a child. They stated their throat had swollen as a child during the event. Patient was told that it was an anaphylactic reaction and shouldn&#39;t have been managed at home as a child by nurse and should have been taken to the hospital. Patient was told they would be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. Within 2-3 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient reported tingling or burning around the site of injections. Within 5 minutes they stated to be feeling tired and that their arm had felt numb. After this the patient began starring into the distance and was unresponsive. Called for help and advice by turning around as patient had syncoped. Got nurses and other team members attention and had an epi-pen ready just in case it was needed. Patient began having notable distress with respiration and administed an epi-pen. Advised for a nurse to call EMS for patient and crash cart/oxygen was also obtaine dby the facility. Oxygen was required. Patient was not responsive after the first dose and was given a second as they remained un-alert with notable distress. The patient became alert a while after receiving the second shot and not long after that the EMS arrived to the event.

I had been asleep, but woke up feeling nauseous, got out of bed to get to the bathroom and my husband said I collapsed, stiffened and had spasms, when I regained consciousness, I had buzzing in my ears, and couldn&#39;t feel my extremities for a few minutes.

                                                Patient post vaccine administration approx 20 minutes. Reported feelinging tightness in chest, spreading to throat. Patient was taken to observation portion of clinic. Patient was hypoxic in 70&#39;s. Supplemental oxygen applied. Oxygen saturation increased to 88. Epipen administered and albuterol nebulizer treatment started while waiting for ED/Rapid response team to arrive. Patient transferred to ED for further observation.  From the physician that treated the patient: &#34;It was a bit of a bizarre presentation. She reported throat tightness after the vaccine. She had a completely normal exam and no other complaints. no signs of airway/oral/pharyngeal abnormality. no respiratory abnormality. Unfortunately she was significantly hypoxic when I took her vitals. as low as 76%. Good waveform. I even checked the pulse ox on myself because I didn&#39;t believe it. In addition, with supplemental oxygen, her sats went up. I had to pull the trigger and treat her even though she looked well and I had no objective exam findings to explain her profound hypoxia. She received IM Epinepherine and Albuterol neb. By the time she was in ED she was satting 100% and her throat tightness resolved. So, not sure how to answer your question. Clinically I pulled the trigger and treated her for anaphylaxis following a vaccine administration. I wish it was a problem with my sat monitor but I don&#39;t believe it was. I was using a life-pack with wave form and verified with two other people that the O2 saturation function was working properly. Intuitively, it doesn&#39;t make sense but I think we should probably consider it a reaction to the vaccine. &#34;

                                                Left side stroke-like symptoms. I was walking and 20 minutes in I started having left leg weakness. This then turned into full left side numb/foggy feeling. I was with my son (and I&#39;m a nurse) so I asked him to test for signs of a stroke. I could smile evenly but it didn&#39;t feel like it. I had strength in both hands and could lift my arms. I was able to communicate what to look for to my son without slurred speech. But I was not stable on my left foot and felt as if I was listing to the left side. My left side was foggy. I moved my arm but flet it in slow motion. When I got home, I sat down and stretched. The symptoms went away and I was able to continue the day without episode. The episode lasted 20-30 minutes as I was walking home still. In hind sight, I did have a similar eposide after the first dose (Moderna lot 037K20A on 1/29/20) while exercising at home but sat down and thought it was due to a hard workout. That time it was just a weak left leg that was giving out on me and lasted 5 minutes because I stopped the workout.

Woke up around 1:30am arm hurting so I got up to get some more tylenol. I immediately felt sick to my stomach (both ways) and I passed out and broke my nose.  I was coherient at times and other times I could not seem to answer any questions. My husband got me to the ER and they took my blood pressure 4 or 5 times and the nurse said &#34;I can&#39;t get a blood pressure&#34;. Another nurse came in and said we will take this one ! My blood pressure had bottomed out and caused all sorts of things going on. I left ER after 4 1/2 hrs. with a BP of 107/57 but I am not sure how low it got! At one point my husband looked at monitor and my bottom number was 39 but it is all a blur to me. As of today I still feel week (heavy arms) and I am concerned about taking my second dose!

At 10pm I started feeling light headed and walked to the kitchen to get water. I began feeling weak and more dizzy and went back to my bedroom to lie down. I felt a rush to my head, passed out and woke up on the ground. I am unsure how long I lost consciousness:  minutes/ seconds.  I was able to get to my bed and called my husband for help. I broke into a hot, drenching sweat to the point I had to change my clothes.  The dizziness eventually cleared. I have a headache and am still nauseated today but not dizzy.  I have never had an experience like this before.

She has had some diarrhea with this. No abdominal pain. She denies recent fevers or chills. She denies prior cardiac hx. No significant family history. Non-smoker.   Labs are notable for mildly elevated liver enzymes. D-dimer is elevated so CTA chest was obtained and is negative for PE. Patient was given solumedrol and benadryl prior to arrival. Symptoms improved during ED stay. No uvular swelling or oral involvement. Airway is patent. Patient advised to follow up with her PCP for re-evaluation and repeat labs. Rx for prednisone and pepcid. Continue benadryl.&#34;     Pt was given NS 1000 mL IV x1, diphenhydramine 25 mg IV x1, and famotidine 20 mg IV x1 while in SCH ED. Pt did already received diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone at the Urgent Care. Allergy added to patient chart for Covid-19 MRNA vaccine.  Then, on 3/7/21, patient did return to ED with continuing reaction (new upper lip swelling). Dr  noted: &#34;Presentation c/w allergic reaction to Moderna vaccine. New upper lip swelling, but lower lip swelling and urticaria have resolved. No airway compromise or acute bronchospasm. Discussed option of switching from Benadryl to Zyrtec, if overly sedating. Continue Prednisone. Consider Pepcid twice daily. Discussed angioedema, with possibility of improvement without repeated exposure. Dose of Pepcid given in ED. Comfortable with plan to release.&#34;

                                                Within 6 hours I had overwhelming headache with injection site pain that radiated up to my ear and down to my elbow. I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

Patient reports feeling fatigued, having cough, and feeling more short of breath for the last day, and has developed central chest pain which is pleuritic in the emergency department.  She reports that the chest pain is 4/10 in severity and does not radiate.  Her caregiver at bedside reports that the patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for the last 3 or so weeks.  Of note, she becomes dyspneic with limited exertion, such as going up a flight of stairs, at baseline.  She had a fever of 101.4 °F at home earlier today, but denies chills or diaphoresis.  He had 1 episode of nonbloody vomiting earlier today.  Denies nausea at this time.  She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday, 4 weeks after the first.   They note that approximately 5 years ago, she had a prolonged admission for which she was transferred to OHSU and was on ECMO for a time before making a nearly full recovery.  She has had the baseline dyspnea on exertion since that time.   Review of Systems  Constitutional: Positive for fever and malaise/fatigue. Negative for chills.  HENT: Negative for sore throat.

There is hazy reticulonodular interstitial opacity seen within the left mid and both lower lung zones suspicious for interstitial pulmonary edema. CARDIAC: Slightly worsened mild cardiomegaly. MEDIASTINUM: Normal. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. LINES/TUBES: None. BONES: There is mild rightward convexity curvature of the thoracic spine along with minimal multilevel degenerative change. OTHER: Surgical clips overlie the left lung apex medially and the right upper abdominal quadrant.   IMPRESSION: 1. See above.   CT angiogram pulmonary:  FINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  -Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  Considerations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (&#34;tea and toast&#34;), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   - Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

I sat on the toilet b/c wasn&#39;t sure if going to have a BM or vomit, then the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor, so assumed loss of consciousness.  Couldn&#39;t move or get up from floor because so weak.  Another wave of severe nausea occurred and then my husband helped me sit up and lean on the toilet to vomit, and I lost consciousness again for 3 to 4 seconds.  Layed on the floor again for a bit, then made it to bed.  At 5 am had another wave of nausea and vomiting and started to have a bowel movement and vomit at the same time and lost consciousness again for a few seconds, my husband had to prop up my head.  I was able to make it into bed and then the symptoms gradually subsided.  I was able to eat around noon.  My husband and I are both physicians so didn&#39;t seek medical care.

                                                Initial injection site pain for two days.  Around day five, both armpits were discolored significantly.  On day nine I was in the ER with left side abdominal cramps that was diagnosed after a CT Scan as a splenic infarction caused by a blot clot.  I have not had a blot clot previously and have always been healthy with no surgeries or prescription medications except propranolol for anxiety (since the pandemic started).

                                                I had the usual flu-like symptoms starting around 9 pm the day of the vaccination 24th) - headache, chills, lethargy, loss of appetite, injection site pain. I didn&#39;t notice anything else overnight, exception injection site pain increased. The next morning I got up around 6:45 am to feed my pets. I felt woozy walking about 25 m from the bedroom to the pet food location, and also very flushed and hot. I started sweating copiously while I was getting the food out, and then I fainted. I don&#39;t know how long I was unconscious but I suspect not more than a minute or two. I didn&#39;t seem to injure myself when I fell, other than a bruised elbow and hip I was able to finish feeding the pets, crawl to the bathroom (I had a strong accompanying urge to evacuate my bowels), and then get into bed. I went back to sleep at around 7:15 am and by 10:00 am I felt more normal, still with some chills and headache, general lethargy, and not much appetite. Those symptoms lasted through the evening until I went to bed at 9:00 pm, gradually decreasing. Today I feel mostly fine, although dehydrated. I did not record my temperature during the fever spike, nor receive medical attention.

She was then transferred to Emergency Department. Per their report: The patient presents with a swollen discolored left lower leg.  She does have  discoloration and I am concerned for massive DVT and cerulea dolens.  She does  have really minimal pain to the leg except to the groin, she has intact pulses,  I have low suspicion for acute ischemia/arterial clot.  She does complain of  some mild dyspnea with exertion above baseline so I do have concerns for  possible PE.  She is hemodynamically stable, appears in no distress.  She is on  oral contraceptives, mild obesity, no other significant VTE risk factors.  I am  going to empirically start her on heparin, I have also ordered a CT PE and a CT  abdomen pelvis to check for proximal propagation of the DVT along with a left  lower extremity duplex Doppler ultrasound.    Duplex ultrasound also showed extensive left lower extremity DVT up to the  common femoral, she does have bilateral PEs without evidence of significant clot  burden or heart strain, she is hemodynamically stable with normal pulse  oximetry.  The patient also has clots proximal up to her IVC.  I discussed this  with Dr.  of vascular surgery for possible thrombolysis therapy of the  left lower extremity.  She was discussed with SOUND for admission.

Then lost awareness and surrounding noise sounded as if I were in a cave, echoes and non-discernable. Lost consciousness for several minutes.  Next recollection was regaining awareness, clothes soaked with sweat. Was lying on a bed with no recollection of being moved to the bed. Shakes and feeling of distress. Experienced shakes and a tingling sensation for approximately 15 minutes. Once that subsided I experienced chills for the better part of an hour. Would like to add, I have no phobias of injections and regularly have blood samples drawn for medical evolutions with my primary care physician.  Was counselled by administering physician to go home and skip work.

She denied any rash, feeling of swelling in her throat or tongue and had no trouble breathing. Patient declined to have EMTs called because she did not feel it was anaphylaxis.  A dose of 50mg of Benadryl was via orally and she was closely monitored.  Her blood preassure was 128/84 and heart rate was 80.  She had offers to drive her to either the ER or urgent care but declined saying it was isolated to her lips and the tip of her tongue.  Patient is a nurse and was aware of what to watch for.  Pharmacy staff continued to observe her for an additional 45 minutes.  At that time she said the issues were resolving and she would like to go home.  She was counseled on what to look for with worsening reaction but said she felt more frustrated that anything.  Pharmacist encouraged her to reach out to her PCP and also explained we would be unable to give her the next shot at a clinic.  She was advised to speak more with her doctor regarding if she should get a second dose.  Patient was followed up with 2 hours after vaccination by phone and reported symptoms resolved and she was just tired from the Benadryl.  Patient was also called the day after and said she had a bad headache but otherwise no other signs of adverse reaction.

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

I went to the bathroom and thought I would be sick, but I remember being so dizzy that I went to lay on the floor by the toilet but my husband said he heard a thud, and came to find me passed out. Then I was shaking  (a vaso vagel response I guess) til I came to. The ems came, but everything was fine, so I elected to stay home. I threw up a 1/2 hour later and then felt better, and slept for a few hours. The rest of the day I was just exhausted. Today I woke up feeling fine! Just wanted to report the episode in case you track vomiting and dizziness and fainting.

I was seated on a sofa, my eyes closed and I lost consciousness. My daughter reported that my arms went back and forth as did my head. I woke back up and felt dizzy but fine otherwise. I have never had a seizure or anything like that happen to me on the past. I did have all flu like symptoms (fever, chills, body aches, headache) 12 hours post vaccine which I expected to happen. All of these flu like symptoms  occurred 2/23 and were essentially gone by 2/24.  I am not reporting the flu like symptoms as ?adverse ?. I am simply reporting the seizure like activity that occurred approximately 1:00 pm  on 2/24.  I did not seek medical attention but I am following up with my doctor. No more seizures have occurred.

Some hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills, headache, started vomiting and my blood pressure started bottoming up that is when I was rushed to the ER. I was admitted and stayed 2 days. They said it was not related to the vaccine. First they told me it was sepsis. Then they told me it was pneumonia, not sepsis. Then said it was a bacterial infection. I sincerely do not know what I had. I am doing better now. My PCP did not recommend me to receive the second dose.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA received on Saturday.  Sunday morning in the middle of my sleep, I woke feeling hot and sweaty, slightly nauseated, and like I had to defecate.  I stood up, felt like low blood pressure but wanted to get to the bathroom.  I walked towards the door, opened the door and fainted, falling backwards.  My spouse  states I was pale,staring at the ceiling and kind of stiff in my arms and legs for about 3 minutes.  He spoke to me, checked my pulse, covered me, poked my feet. As I came back to awareness I tried to speak and was unintelligible but then became more conscious.  He tested me with questions to make sure I was ok.  I defecated after that but did not vomit.  I was tired the rest of the day and napped for several hours.  I don&#39;t seem to have hurt anything in the fall.  I am instructed to be off work Monday by my supervisor.

                                                a couple hours after the vaccine, I experienced a bit of rapid heart rate, which resolved after a few minutes. The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma and Allergy. Concomitant products included EPINEPHRINE (EPIPEN) for Allergy, ALBUTEROL SULFATE for Asthma.    On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced the first episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced the second episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 11-Apr-2021, last episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       The patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction of constricted throat, face and neck turning red, tingling and numbness in her face and throat, red bumps on her face and throat, and her face felt like it was burning. She used her EpiPen and it wasn&#39;t enough (didn&#39;t improve the reaction), so she went to the emergency room. They gave 2 prednisone tabs and prescribed prednisone and gave her IV saline and antihistamine. They released her 2 hours later. Her doctor advised her against getting the second dose. After the patient recovered from initial anaphylactic reaction on 12Mar2021, she had 2 episodes of anaphylactic reaction on 09APR2021, requiring the use of two EpiPens, Benadryl, Prednisone, and albuterol. On 10APR2021 at 0100 another anaphylactic reaction requiring EpiPen, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Albuterol. And at 4pm another anaphylactic reaction requiring Benadryl, EpiPen, and albuterol. Currently she has recovered.

Presented to the hospital on 1/24, and was found to have a small stroke in pontine medullary junction.  Discharged on 1/25.  There is some suspicion that her COVID infection in December may have precipitated this, and patient is currently being evaluated for coagulation disorders, primarily antiphospholipid antibody testing.  It is unlikely that the vaccine contributed to this, but given close timeline between the two, filing this report.

                                                This patient was at work two days after her vaccine and went to the bathroom. When she did not come back to work after around 20 minutes, she was found unresponsive and an ambulance was called. The patient was declared deceased at the  ER with the cause of death initially as cardiac arrest however a full autopsy was performed and  Coroner&#39;s office is awaiting that report at this time. We did not know of the death until we went back this week to complete the second round of vaccinations. Since the death happened in such close proximity to the vaccination date we felt it prudent to report.

I quickly started vomiting  which was intense and persistent.  I had no food in my system so vomiting was mostly dry heaves, bile and what ever water I could drink.   Shortly after the vomiting began, I believe I passed out, fell and hit my head on the floor.   I don&#39;t remember falling but my husband said he heard the fall and I developed a large lump/bruise on my forehead.  The persistent vomiting lasted about 4-5 hours and other symptoms gradually improved.  1/11/21 I still have a milder headache, slight nausea and some fatigue.

Woke at around 4 AM to go to bathroom felt fine upon awakening,  Once in bathroom felt nauseated, and dizzy.  Washing hands felt REALLY nauseated, next thing I know, my husband is hovered over me, as I had passed out unconscious onto bathroom floor.  I landed on my left side.  No blood.  Started immediately with visiable chills, and fever accompanied by headache and dizziness.  Fever lasted until Wednesday mid morning.  Dizzy lightheadedness, and Headache is still on going.  Primary care Dr. had X-rays, and MRI to rule out broken bones and/or concussion.  Tests confirmed I had not broken anything, and I had not a concussion.   Dr. suspects the issues I am experiencing are from vaccine reaction.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Familial hypercholesterolemia, Peripheral arterial disease and Stent placement (has stents in her iliac ery). Concomitant products included ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM (ATORVASTATIN [ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM]), ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (BABY ASPIRIN) and SERTRALINE for an unknown indication.    On 26-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 27-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (possible stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOSIS (small clot that went through and resolved on its own) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MONOPLEGIA (Loss use of left leg/couldn&#39;t use her leg) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and PARAESTHESIA (tingling in left arm) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 27-Mar-2021 to 28-Mar-2021 due to CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT, MONOPLEGIA, PARAESTHESIA and THROMBOSIS. At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (possible stroke), THROMBOSIS (small clot that went through and resolved on its own), MONOPLEGIA (Loss use of left leg/couldn&#39;t use her leg) and PARAESTHESIA (tingling in left arm) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Computerised tomogram: Inconclusive. In March 2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: Inconclusive.   The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.  No treatment information was provided.   Patient reports an MRI and CT scan was done, and she was informed that they suspected she had a small cot that went through and resolved on its own.  Company Comment: Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However patient&#39;s hx of familial hypercholesterolemia, peripheral arterial disease and stent placement are confounding factors that may play a possible contributory role.

However the patient was diagnosed with a positive COVID-19 test on January 4, 2021.  Patient complained of nausea, vomiting, back pain, and sharp chest pain.     On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture). She was taken to the hospital that evening on February 8, 2021. Patuent experienced a second seizure while at the hospital during a CT scan. Patient later was able to come home February 11, 2021 in the afternoon. Patient now has to wear a neck brace for up to 12 weeks, cannot drive, cannot work for up to 12 weeks, and is still recovering cognitively from the concussion.

                                                Moderna #1 vaccine given at 130pm March 11th 2021. Pt had history of asthma and frequent nebulizer use and had it in car with her for drive-thru vaccine clinic we did at location, which has a large parking lot. We gave 80 doses. Pt checked off anaphylaxis on the intake form so Dr spoke to her and she changed it to no history of anaphylaxis and only has history of asthma. So we gave her the vaccine. About 5 minutes later in car parking lot she started to use her personal nebulizer. I saw her in passenger side of car using a personal nebulizer so I talked to her and her daughter to find out what was going on. They said she has exacerbations all the time and this was not out of ordinary for her. I checked pulse ox and did a lung exam, etc, and she was stable.  She seemed baseline according to history by her and her daughter.  As she seemed at baseline and clinically was comfortable and conversant whole time, and she felt better after her nebulizer, I told them to have a low threshold for going to ER or calling 911 if her asthma was worse or different than her usual symptoms.  They agreed. According to daughter, she did well until about 24 hours the next day. The daughter said she was fine and she went to store and when she returned EMTs were intubating patient and apparently the patient used her epipen and called 911 herself. Approximate time of expiration was 230pm on March12th 2021.

On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized on 10-Apr-2021 due to PULMONARY EMBOLISM. At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) outcome was unknown.            No concomitant medications reported.  The patient developed a blood clot in the lower left lung, and was hospitalized. The doctor told her that because of cancer, radiation and recent mastectomy surgery she was at risk of developing blood clots. Treatment medication included apixaban for six months. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Company Comment: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s underlying cancer, radiation and recent mastectomy surgery were considered to be risk factors for developing blood clots.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The pain in my right arm and around the back of my head and neck increased all day on Saturday, latter that night the pain woke me out of my sleep, and as I attempted to go to the restroom, I passed out.  I woke up on the floor where I had passed out face down, with a busted bloody lip and bruises and broken skin on both knees.  Very frightening, Thank God that I woke up because I live alone.   Thank you.

Patient states her and her husband came across a news article that stated the vaccine she received is in question and believes that could be part of the reason for her adverse reactions. Patient states that she still doesn&#39;t feel normal but her doctor told her to give it a few more days for symptoms to subside.

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 04 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the right arm for COVID-19 infection.  On an unspecified date, a few days after vaccination administration, the patient experienced red rash around the injection site which was tender and itchy and was diagnosed by a nurse as cellulitis, which later resolved.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient began coughing.   On 18 Jan 2021, the patient went to urgent care for a COVID-19 test and the results came back negative.

The event, injection site cellulitis, red rash around injection site which was tender and itchy, was reported as resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the report lacks critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications.  Noting that cellulitis and pneumonia are usually caused by an infectious agent, both events are considered unlikely associated with mRNA-1273. Pneumothorax is confounded by the pneumonia.

Went home and within another 20 minutes had completely lost voice.  Went back to Urgent Care.  Was told again to keep an eye on it or go to ER.  They didn&#39;t even look at me.  My own Doctor was down the street so I went right to her office.  My doctor was not in, so another doctor came right out to look at me.  She checked my breathing and it was okay but I could not speak at all.  She put me on prednisone and Benadryl for several days.  Eventually felt better after meds.  Made appointment with allergist, for follow-up.   He said it was an anaphylaxis reaction.  Was told to not get second dose of Moderna shot. I have since had the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/30/2021 with no immediate adverse reaction, just side effects (chills, severe headache, fatigue, sore arm).

                                                Vaccine induced pancytopenia /  thrombocytopenia - STILL ONGOING WITH TREATMENT.  My mom felt very tired the 2nd day after the vaccine; blood taken ~5 days after vaccination showed lower HgB count (8.8 from her normal range of 11&#43;). She remained at home for recovery and then consulted a hematologist. During this period she still felt extremely tired / dizzy / headaches / couldn&#39;t walk up the stairs without breath. 13 days later - more blood sample was taken and now she is diagnosed with pancytopenia - lowered count of RBC (it down further), HgB (down further to 7.1), and Platelets (down to 80 from ~170 her first blood sample). And she was hospitalized. They gave her Prednisone, and a blood transfusion at the hospital. During this first stay - her RBC / HgB and Platelets seemed to have stablized and went higher but they didn&#39;t pay attention to her WBC - which went down to 2 (below normal range). A day later during follow up around WBC - it went lower to ~1.2 (her platelets ~117). She developed a fever - now it is considered a neutropenic fever and she was hospitalized once again (platelets was back down to 84 at the beginning of her stay). During this past week in the hospital, they gave her meds to induce WBC growth - which worked but it overshot to 12 (above normal range) and at the same time her platelets and RBC and HgB dipped again lower. Platelets dipped to 43 on Saturday along with HgB down to  7.1 after 2 days of sustained high WBC count so they gave her IVIG and another blood transfusion. After that, her WBC dropped a little further and is stabilizing around 6 along with HgB around ~10. However her platelets remain high volatile - it went to 51 on Sunday, dropped to 46 on Monday, and now it is 38 today. She was discharged from the hospital today and we have a standing order to have her blood tested everyday.

                                                Monday evening - Extreme pain in the arm where the injection was given. Swollen (like a baseball) and very red. I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction. Shot given around 9am. Around 11am symptoms appeared: extremely hot/flushed, nauseated, felt ill, difficulty swallowing. Went to pharmacist who had me sit down, within 30 seconds could not swallow. Pharmacist injected me with Epi Pen and called 911. Paramedics arrived gave more epinephrine, oxygen, started breathing treatment. Lost my voice as throat started to tighten more. Taken to Hospital where I was given Benadryl, steroids, stomach meds, more fluids and another breathing treatment since my lungs were so tight, I could only take shallow breaths. The crated my lungs, did blood work and kept me overnight for observation because I have a history of secondary reactions when I experience anaphylaxis. I was released from the hospital on 2/20/2021 at 2pm.

I fainted and cut my forehead in the fall.  I was shaking uncontrollably following this.  My husband bandaged my forehead and checked me for a concussion.  Sometime after 2am I realized I was in atrial fibrillation.  I have a Kardia app that confirmed this.  I tried at home methods to go back in rhythm.  At 8am I called my cardiologist.  He advised me to go to the emergency room.  At this time the Kardia app indicated I was no longer in Afib but still had a fast heartbeat.  At the emergency room I had a normal EKG, CAT scan, blood work and chest X-ray and went home about 11am.

I called husband in the afternoon to check on patient and he stated that she was good. I also followed up on 03/05/2021 with the patient and she stated that other than soreness that she was fine. I let patient know that since she had a reaction to the first dose, that she would not be able to receive the second dose.
