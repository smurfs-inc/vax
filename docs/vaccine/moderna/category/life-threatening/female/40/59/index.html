She also developed a fever during the day.  She did not seek treatment until Sunday and went to Hospital ED.  She was treated and released same day.  She went back to hospital on Monday as she felt worse and she was admitted at that time and treated for a bloodstream infection and meningitis.  We are not sure it was caused by the vaccine.  She consulted her PCP and her PCP feels it may be more coincidental given her medical HX.

                                                On January 4 at 2:00 pm I suddenly started to bleed from the nose from the left nostril and then from both. The event lasted more than 35 minutes so I had to go to the ER. The diagnosis was Epistaxis. I was discharged because at the time of the medical evaluation I removed a large clot from my mouth and the bleeding stopped.  Appointment with primary physician for diagnosis and appointment with ENT was ordered. On January 5 at 4:15 am I had another episode of nasal bleeding lasting 25 min. After removing a clot through the mouth, the bleeding stopped. At 4:00 pm I presented Epistaxis again so I had to return to the Emergency Room. I was reevaluated and the instruction was to visit the ENT and Afrin prescription for three days and Claritin D q 12 hrs PRN. From January 6 to 9, I began to eliminate a serous-bloody vaginal discharge. That began with the elimination of a clot and progressively diminished day by day.  January 11, 2021, the ENT evaluated me and indicated that it did not observe polyps or anatomical problems. I had not previously prolonged nosebleeds. Previously two minor episodes happened to me, a year ago that resolved in less than 7 minutes. I didn&#39;t have a cold or any other symptoms.  I want to raise the flag because it was a strange event that occurred after the vaccination and that I had not experienced before in that way.My next dose is January 29, 2021. I am awaiting clot test results

The patient&#39;s medical history included a propensity for fainting and low blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient got dizzy, had nausea, a little vomit, and fainted to the floor. She reported feeling dizzy, hot and sweaty.  Patient did not take medication to treat her symptoms.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, fainted, dizziness, felt hot, nausea and vomiting, and sweaty were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 40-year-old female patient with medical history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the unlisted event of Syncope which was considered medically significant. Additionally, the patient experienced the non-serious listed events of Nausea and Vomiting, and the non-serious unlisted events of Feeling Hot, Dizziness and Hyperhidrosis. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. We would note that the patient&#39;s history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure could be also contributory.

                                                I started my menstrual cycle about one week early, experienced dark, brown tinged spotting for 2 days followed by  heavy flow with more clotting than I have ever experienced before.  Cycle lasted about  8 days, versus my normal 4 days.  These symptoms concern me due to several reports of miscarriages while receiving vaccine.

                                                Immediately after getting the 1st vaccine I had a very sore arm that lasted about 3 days. 2 days it was so sore that I took 800mg ibuprofen every 6 hours and put heat and ice on site for 20 min on 20 min off and alternating for 2 days while awake. No other symptoms.  For 2nd vaccine, the vaccine itself was extremely painful (burned and pain at site and tingled down to fingertips for a few hours. Applied pressure as I bled for 10 min after administration. Followed by ice off and on for 20 min for first 2 hours.  At 22 hours, I started to feel nauseated and lightheaded and had mental fogginess. The following morning, I awoke around 3am and was very ill with flu like symptoms. mild temperature of 99.8, chills, body aches, fatigue, rapid pulse, headache, sore throat, and mental fogginess. This lasted for approx. 36 hours. The worse symptoms were the headache, fatigue, and severe body aches that lasted for 72 hours after vaccine.

Nausea started about 8pm night of vaccine along with extremely sore arm. Nausea persisted all night and at 5am felt like I was going to be sick so went to bathroom. Sat down on toilet and don?t remember anything until I woke up on bathroom floor with two knots on my head. Unsure if syncopal episode or seizure as I have multiple knots on head and my belongings from my pockets were strewn about the floor. Body aches began around noon day after shot along with low grade temps and chills. Nausea and headache persists today (2/18) but I am unsure if that is from vaccine or head injury.

                                                At roughly 9:00pm I was scrolling through my phone when it became very difficult to focus and I felt nauseous.  I got up to go to the bathroom and became extremely dizzy and my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest.  I was having difficulty breathing  and felt disorientated.  I crawled up the stairs and when I reached the top I stood up to walk and promptly fainted/passed out.  According to my husband I was out for roughly 30 seconds.  He described my body as completely tense (formed fists, shaking). I don&#39;t have any recollection of passing out.  When I came to I was overwhelmed with nausea and immediately vomited.  I was sweating profusely and struggling to breath.  After I vomited, within minutes (less than three) I felt fine.  My heart rate returned to normal and I wasn&#39;t dizzy or nauseous.

More vomiting, chills, and hot flashes occurred after this event.  This event subsided at about 0300 hours and I was able to get some rest.  I have a skin rash that developed after the vaccine but is undocumented when it began.  It is still persisting today, one week after the vaccination.

Several hours later, my arms and hands were tingling and numb, followed by some chest pains momentarily. Eight hires after the shot, I got up to use the restroom, in distress of the tingling and numbness. I was sitting on the toilet and seem to be going in and out of consciousness. I stood up, washed my hands... and woke up on the bathroom floor. I had clearly passed out, hit my head and lost some time.

After I laid on the floor for a while, I regained enough energy and to make it back to the bathroom with an intense urge to defecate. (I almost pooped my pants while passed out.)  But, it wasn?t diarrhea consistency   It was blackish, but normal consistency.  At some point I took 2 Tylenol and fell asleep in the floor. By 2:30am, I was feeling strong enough to climb back into bed. I felt like I was dying but then it was over pretty quickly and I was back to feeling normal flu symptoms; 102 fever, body aches, etc.

                                                ?Moderna COVID- 19 Vaccine EUA? Flu vaccine allergy discussed at length with patient prior to Moderna vaccine.

                                                I received the injection around 2:15 pm.  There were no immediate effects. By late afternoon/early evening, my arm was a bit sore and later started to feel warm near the injection site.  However, I otherwise felt fine.  At 9 pm, I suddenly became very dizzy and passed out for several minutes. When I regained consciousness, I felt a little short of breath, which resolved within 20 minutes or so. However, I was also extremely nauseous, which got worse any time I tried to move. This continued for several hours.  I also alternated between being very warm and chills during this time - it was like waves of heat. I did not have a fever. Later, my head began to hurt and I took tylenol to help with that. I also had diarrhea. These symptoms began to gradually lessen after a couple of hours and I was able to fall asleep around 12:30 pm. I woke up hot and sweaty several times throughout the night. The following day, 1/6, I was very tired and had a headache and could not eat much, but otherwise felt much better.

                                                As I was leaving the clinic, roughly 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I because very nauseous and returned to tell the nurse I didn&#39;t feel well.  I then had an episode of syncope and was unconscious for around 40 seconds.  I was transported to the hospital via ambulance.  In the ambulance I had a second syncopal episode while the EKG monitored that my HR dropped to 30 bpm.  I was unconscious the 2nd time for around 1 minute.  Upon arrival to the ER I vomited uncontrollably for a few minutes.   For the last 3 weeks following the vaccine I&#39;ve had a fever of 99.8, headaches, mild diarrhea and nausea.  For 10 days following the vaccine I had trouble with thinking clearly and &#34;brain fog&#34;.  Beginning 2 days post-vaccination my left supraclavicular lymph nodes became very swollen and hard and have remained that way since.

Initially, pt experienced palpitations and tightness in throat after vaccination  and wasn&#39;t sure if she was experiencing swelling in her arms.  BP was 130/79 and HR 93 initially.  Pt started to feel better without intervention but given diphenhydramine as a precaution while we continued to monitor her.  10 mins later she started to have tingling in lips and tongue and visible lip swelling  in addition to palpitations.   Immediately administered Epipen (0.3mg) x 1.  EMS was called.  No worsening but not improvement after 5 mins so a second dose of Epipen (0.3mg) was administered.  By the time EMS arrived (9 mins after first epipen dose) pt was feeling better, swelling had resolved, no throat tightness.  Pt was transported to local hospital by EMS for monitoring.

I couldn?t breathe and apparently passed out. My husband called 911 and I came in and out for about 30 min he said. I couldn?t open my eyes and couldn?t feel my legs. Bp was normal and so was blood glucose. They gave me some fluids and nausea meds and I started coming too. Today I am extremely achy and terrible headache, scared to get out of bed.

I went to ER; CT scan was concerning for clot in sinus so I was sent via ambulance to inpatient neurology where further MRI/MRV scans determined it was not in fact a clot, but a small bleed of unknown origin. Again, I had no injuries. I was hospitalized while multiple scans were completed along with lab work. Home now following up with neurology, still have head pain, unable to fully work, etc. Hematoma is still there but not growing.

I got up again and then fainted and hit the floor. My husband then called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.

                                                In the middle of the night I passed out while walking from the bathroom. I broke my front tooth in half and smashed in 2 other front teeth. Also bruised cheek, lip, and knee. I had been feeling chills, aches, and flu-like symptoms throughout the night. It required a dental surgeon, dentist, and probably braces. The advice nurse advised going to the Emergency Room due to her concern about a head injury.

                                                I felt very heavy (especially my limbs) and had a slight headache on Thursday (the day after receiving the vaccine).  This feeling continued into Friday morning when I nearly passed out (blacked out and collapsed for a split second) as I was crouched position for approximately 10 minutes at work.  I felt dizzy and slow moving for the next several hours.  My blood pressure was rated as normal, blood oxygen normal, and pulse slightly low by a nurse on staff who took my vitals after the episode.   My temperature, which had been 97.8 prior to the event that morning (typical for me) was elevated during this time to 100.2 and returned to normal after approximately 4 hours without medication.  I was fatigued, so I slept for approximately 4-5 hours that afternoon and began feeling better the following day (Saturday).

Got up at 6:30 am today (2/11/21), used the bathroom, felt very dizzy and lightheaded, started sweating profusely, tried to make it back to bed, took 4 steps and passed out, hitting my face on dresser.  This has only happened one other time, 16 years ago when I was pregnant, flying on vacation and hadn?t eaten, blood sugar dropped and I passed out momentarily. No history of fainting, not diabetic, no health issues whatsoever. Healthy weight, fit and in shape.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported by the reporter. Concomitant medications were not provided.  On 19-Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20-Jan-2021, 24 hours after vaccine administration, the patient reported that she was shivering and shaking really bad and had a headache day afterwards.  On an unknown date, she reported that her tongue was swollen. She also reported that the she passed out and doesn&#39;t know if she had a seizure (date unknown). The patient reported that she took ibroprophen for her headache and diphenhydramine for itchiness.  On 28-Jan-2021, she reported that she felt fine.   Treatment for events included ibroprophen and diphenhydramine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The outcomes of events, experienced some side effects was unknown, shivering, shaking really bad, had a headache day afterwards, tongue was swollen, passed out and doesn&#39;t know if she had a seizure and itchiness, were considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association between the reported events and the product use cannot be excluded.  Headache and chills are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine

Had a syncope episode/potential seizure on 1/13/21 - unwitnessed loss of consciousness for a short period of time with loss of urinary continence.   2nd Moderna COVID shot on 1/29/21 with no reactions.  My doctors evaluating me did not consider this as a COVID vaccine reaction, even though it did occur after the first vaccination.  I am a nurse with a doctorate degree and do not believe the seizure was the reaction of the COVID vaccine.  I was under extreme amounts of stress at work at the time.  I also have a prior medical history of syncope episodes when I was a teenager (25&#43; years ago).

After she got off the phone, about 7 minutes after her injection, she started to feel like she was going to faint,  she then put her head between her knees like she normally does when she gets that feeling, and then when she came to, she felt better. The patient had blown her horn, so an EMT and nurses were able to assist her right away. EMS was called to check patient for her syncopal episode.

                                                The patient had a previous reaction to a flu vaccine.  She was treated for Bell&#39;s Palsy related to the flu vaccine 3 years ago.  The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

                                                During the 15 minute observation following the 1st Moderna vaccine dose, the patient reported her tongue &#39;felt thick,&#39; flushed skin, redness on face, neck, hands, BP=98/60, HR=100.  Patient felt &#39;jittery&#39; and &#39;heart racing.&#39;  Was transferred to ED for evaluation given that patient reported her tongue &#39;getting tighter.&#39;  In the ED, the patient was treated with diphenhydramine 25mg x 2 doses, methylprednisolone 125mg x 1 dose, famotidine 20mg x 1 dose, and NS IV fluids.  Hypoglycemia was ruled out with CBG=87.  The physician avoided treatment with epinephrine due to it being listed on her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;shortness of breath.&#39;  Symptoms resolved over the next 3 hours.  The patient was discharged home with a new prescription of oral prednisone taper.  Subsequent follow-up with her primary care provider, in consultation with an ID provider, recommended that this patient NOT get a 2nd dose.  Covid-19 vaccine was added to her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;anaphylaxis.&#39;

She got really cold to the point that she was layered up with blankets, shivering with 4 layers, teeth shattering, possibly going into shock, took Tylenol, her temp was 100.  She went to sleep and was just trying to get warm.  The next morning she still had a fever of 100.  She continued to take Tylenol and by Friday 2/5/21 was okay.   She is 4&#39;11 and weighs 85#, wondering if the dose was too strong for her body frame, otherwise healthy person.

She felt that the pain went into the lymph nodes and into her back. The headache, pain and sore throat worsened over the afternoon. By the time she got home at 4:30pm she had whole body aches and was feeling really bad. She developed facial and eyelid swelling. She applied ice. Her eyelids swelled so much that they cracked. Her face has a dry, red rash. She later got up to take bedtime medications and she passed out. She began vomiting. She declined an offer to call the ambulance or to go be seen by a doctor. She took tylenol for pain and zofran for vomiting. On 2/6/21, she developed diarrhea. She was

At 10:30pm on the 13th, my husband and I decided to try and move my arm slowly up and down to help &#34;loosen the stiffness&#34; when my husband lifted my right arm to about shoulder height, the pain was so bad I fainted. I have never fainted before in my life.  I was out for about 2-3 minutes.

Immediately after shot my body got hot and my feet were on fire. On the way home approx 1 1/2 hours afterward my mind was foggy. 2 hours after shot I experienced tachycardia with heart rate  at 138 beats per min and blood pressure 138/94 A friend came over to stay with me cause all I could do is lay down. My legs felt like they weight a ton 3 hours after shot. I had chills and nausea that lasted 48 hours after 1 shot. I am required by my job to get 2nd dose next week.  Do you recommend 2nd dose due to reaction off 1st shot?

In the morning at 0600, woke up with nausea  and BM urgency.  Shortly after N/V, chest pain and delerium start.  Chest pain caused anxiety. No SOB. Upon standing, I blacked out and fell to ground.  When I came to ( 5-10 minutes later ) nausea disappeared but arthralgia and chills still present.  I did not take any OTC/ pain relief meds at all since I did not want to blunt my body&#39;s immune response.  Nausea does not return and the CP/ hypotensive/shock episode made me stick to sitting on the couch for the remainder of the day.  I took 400mg IBU around 8 am and all SX disappear by 1800.

                                                2am woke up with severe chills and a severe migraine. At 10am severe migraine progressed to skin on scalp feeling like it was pulled too tight. From there I began to feel an internal tremor in my head, almost like if you ran a jack hammer all day and then stopped, that shaky, off-kilter feeling.  I used the bathroom that morning and had massive diarrhea, experience a vaso/syncope episode and passed out.  All week I felt like this and experienced nausea, dizziness, heart palpitations, severe migraine, internal tremor, severe anxiety and severe thirst.  By Friday, 2/26/21, it got so bad and my blood pressure dropped to 112/50, that I was taken via ambulance to the ER.  They gave me IV fluids, ran labs, EKG, etc.  Blood pressure went up to 137/91.  Released to rehab at home.  2nd ER visit to Hospital on Sunday where they repeated labs, EKG, gave me fluids and treated symptoms. Both trips I was labeled Tachy.

                                                Have had tiredness since 2nd vaccine in February and noticed shortness of breath when walking or going up stairs in mid March.  Around 4/1, I started having left rib pain preventing me from sleeping on my left side and then could not breath during a massage on 4/8.   On April 9th, I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms (clots) in both lungs, reducing my lung capacity to only 30% of normal.  This could be due to Loestrin birth control but I have taken hormones in the past for IVF and when younger for birth control.  The reaction may be due to a combination of vaccine, Loestrin and iron but triggered by vaccine.  I am currently on Eliquis to treat pulmonary embolisms.

                                                3/2 - Received the first round of Moderna vaccination. No immediate side-effects noted.  I talked with my physician prior to getting the vaccine due to medical conditions and medications that I am taking. I was taking Xarelto due to chronic DVT/Blood clots in my left leg.   After 2.5 weeks I noted my left leg was swelling and I started to have discomfort in my leg. No noticeable changes to my leg at this time that made me concerned about getting the second vaccine.   3/30 - I received my second vaccination in the morning. I ended up going into the hospital at 4 pm due to numbness and pain in my left leg. I ended up being admitted to the hospital due to a DVT behind my L knee and in my femoral/iliac veins. I was also diagnosed with May-Thurbers syndrome. All the physicians, hematologists, and surgeons were surprised that I ended up with a severe blood clot as I was on Xarelto for over two years without an incident or problem. I did not have a fall or any change in my life that would have caused this issue to happen and they were all stumped.  I was switched to a heparin drip while Xarelto was clearing out of my system and in two days I had two stints put in my femoral/iliac vein on my left leg.  I was changed over to Lovenox and Coumadin 5-7.5 mg before leaving the hospital. There were no concerns and I was in the hospital from 3/30 to 4/3/21.  After I was discharged from the hospital I went to my primary care follow up on Tuesday 4/6/21. I was having increased pain behind my knee and overall not feeling well. I ended up having more labs completed and another ultrasound to indicate I had a small DVT behind my knee from my procedure.   On Friday 4/9/21 I went in for my INR and found my coumadin was within therapeutic range. When I got home I changed into comfy clothing and noted that I had a red/purplish rash looking dots/bumps from my toes to my knees on both LE, my Left was more significant than my right. I went back into the doctor and I was prescribed a topical steroid to help decrease the edema, pain and redness.   Saturday 4/10/21 - my legs became painful to the touch, they felt like they were going to burst due to pressure, and the rash/reddness was looking worse and spreading. I was sent back to the ER and was admitted back to the hospital. They diagnosed me with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, removed me off of coumadin, and started me on Arixtra. The hematologist, physicians and staff did not know what to do and I was now deemed medically complex and had to be monitored for a few days and gave me prednisone. Once removed from coumadin the rash/pain/swelling subsided and started to diminish. I was discharged from the hospital.  I returned to work on Tuesday 4/13 and after returning home I had increased pain, pressure and rash that now was visible from my knees to my hips and this was not present in the hospital. My physician is asking for a biopsy and increased my prednisone to stay at 20 mg a day.  At night I have to elevate my legs or they become swollen and will become painful.   4/16/21 I wore compression tights per physician guidelines and when I came home from work I had new spots and rashes on my feet, they were swollen and had increased pain. My left ankle had a rash on it as well. After elevation and a nights rest the rash started to diminish and the rest of my legs have started to diminish or disappear.

                                                Woke up on 1/6/2021 with hot flashes, palpitations, dizziness and heart racing.  Went to urgent care and they did an EKG which showed A-Fib, so I was sent to the ER and from there, I was transferred to an ICU at a different facility . I stayed  until 1/8/2021. No cause was found and no history of A-Fib or family history.

I woke the following morning 1/27/21 at 7:20a feeling better,  only slightly tired.  I was awake about 30mins when my husband reported I stated I felt very dizzy while standing in our kitchen, he states I started walking over to our living room when I fainted and fell face first into the side of our sofa.  He stated I came too about 20-30 seconds later.  After awaking my hearing was muffled and my arms were very tingly for about 3 mins.  I felt completely exhausted and slept for a few hours, remaining very  fatigued the rest of the day.  Today, 1/28/21, I woke up feeling tired but tightness to base of my head and neck, no other symptoms.

She went to the emergency room where she displayed symptoms including a fast heart rate, wheezing, and shortness of breath with an angioedema or anaphylaxis like appearance. She was given more epinephrine, famotidine, scheduled diphenhydramine at 50 QAs intravenously (IV), IV steroids, was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She was on the ventilator for approximately 18-20 hours following admission. She eventually responded to a high dose of dexamethasone. She was also given duonebs for her shortness of breath, regular sedation for the ventilator, and a dose of ketorolac. Consent was given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events were unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred approximately 10 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration.

It was sore from my neck down to just below my elbow. I began having chills and a low grade temp shortly after that. by 0130, I was dizzy, experiencing diarrhea, with episodes of diaphoresis, and acute nausea. I felt that I had some postural hypotension, was very pale and every time I would get up to walk I felt like I was going to end up on the ground. I remained in bed for approx. 16 hours before I felt like I comfortable even getting up and going to restroom. I still have intermittent dizziness, with syncope to this date.  I had to leave work early as well as calling in sick for the next shift.

                                                Thursday, 2/21 - started feeling, overall, exhausted, and having lots of aches and pains. My chest and back (near area where I have costochondritis (xiphoid process) was in a great deal of pain. My heart rate also kept jumping around between 65 and 105 without exertion.  Tuesday, 1/26/2021 - I was feeling exhausted and got out of breath with minimal exertion. Heart rate jumped up with minimal exertion (e.g. just standing, heart rate climbed about 110). I also started feeling dizzy and , ultimately, fainted, which put me in the emergency room, where they ruled out a PE and all cardiac emergencies. My blood pressure spiked with a systolic around 165 (my usual is 90-95). Labs indicated everything was fine. The only thing different than usual was the vaccine. This was also the day I realized I developed extreme cold feet and also cold fingers, ears, and nose. My cold feet is still an issue - they get so cold, it?s actually painful. I now have to have a heating pad around my feet at home. This has never happened to me before the vaccine in my, now, 45 years alive. I?m still a bit fatigued, have sporadic aches and pains, sometimes get a little dizzy, and have extremely cold feet...two and a half weeks later.

                                                I felt fine after the vaccination at 11AM. Between 1-3:30PM, I got a pedicure and  drank two 5.4% alcohol beverages. I drove home, made dinner, and ate. Shortly after eating, around 7:00PM, the soreness in my arm got intense, I began feeling nauseous and disoriented. I went to the bathroom and got on my hands and knees because I thought I was going to vomit. My boyfriend helped me get up on the edge of the bathtub, but I quickly passed out and fell forward. He said I was out for approximately 30 seconds. I came to long enough to tell him to call my mom then passed out again. for about 15 seconds Within minutes my mom, sister and daughter arrived, followed by first responders. First responders had to keep me from passing out for about 10 minutes, during which time I broke into a cold, soaking sweat, had involuntary muscle convulsions, extreme nausea, disorientation, slurred speech, and loss of ability to get up or walk on my own. I was admitted to the emergency room around 7:45. It took another hour for me to regain muscle control, speech and total coherency. I was released and went home. My arm was severely sore until Monday morning, but I also experienced severe fatigue, nausea, headache and muscle aches until late Sunday.

                                                My left arm, where I received the shot, began hurting after a few hours. Approximately 12 hours after receiving the shot, fatigue began. Approximately two hours later, I was unable to walk, I collapsed on the floor, my heart was racing, I was sweating, my entire body went numb, and there was ringing and static in my ears. After about 20 minutes on the floor, I got back into bed. My fingers and hands wanted to curl up and not open and that lasted throughout the night. My arms and legs stayed numb all night long.  At around 24 hours post vaccine, the numbness started to subside, I could open my fingers and hands, and regular flu symptoms were present (fatigue, body aches, low grade fever). I could not work the day after receiving the shot. I slept all day. I was not able to drive until around 5PM the day after receiving the shot. The second night and throughout the following day (so 36-48&#43; hours post shot), I had cold sweats. It is now 3 days later and I still feel terrible. I am worried about getting the second Moderna shot.

                                                About 12 hours after the shot, I started running a fever and was very achy.  It got progressively worse.  Around 4:15 am I got up to use the restroom and I passed out.  My husband was able to get me to regain consciousness.  I then passed out again after about 10 minutes.  We then went to the ER because I had a laceration on my eye,and head pain from hitting my night stand, wall, and floor.

                                                I had Covid-19 in December 2020. On the following day of my first vaccine, in the middle of the night, I experienced chills, body aches. At 7am the next day I woke up feeling light headed and passed out. When I woke up I had thrown up on myself and started to hear a whooshing sound in my ears and I went back to bed. At 9am my symptoms started all over again. I live with my house maid and since I did not look well, she took me to urgent care. My BP had dropped and I was super dizzy. I got an IV drip for an hour, anti-nausea medication. My blood was also drawn and found to have underlying anemia. My urine test was negative. The pulse oximetry was fine and by the next day I slowly started to feel better.

                                                Initially there were severe flu like symptoms: chills, shaking, headache &amp; body aches, fatigue starting apx 2 hours following. These continued until apx 24 hours later when additional mental fog set it, difficulty focusing attention, lethargy, trouble walking, dizziness then brief loss of consciousness occurred, extreme difficulty staying awake. I was taken to the emergency room where additional tests were done due to &#34;stroke- like&#34; symptoms.  Tests were okay with hospital staff reporting that likely/only known cause was the COVID  vaccine given the day before. Symptoms have gradually reduced but occasional mental fog, occasional dizzy spells &amp; chronic fatigue persist.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

                                                Injection site pain began approximately 2 hours following injection and continued to intensify and spread down the arm and up the neck and upper back over the next hour. A headache and intense fatigue began and I took 500mg Tylenol at that time. Approximately 30 minutes later I unintentionally lost consciousness and awoke several hours later confused and disorientated. I arose to get a drink of water and was unable to walk, falling twice within approximately 10 feet. I noticed my vision was affected as the entire room appeared to be rocking left to right even though I was holding myself still in an attempt to steady my sight and balance. I immediately went to bed and have no memories until I awoke the next morning. At that time, my vision and balance had returned to normal though the aches and pain in my arm, neck and back persisted. This pain slowly dissipated over the next 3 days.

After the first event, I never fainted again but had several headrush like dizzy spells over the next few weeks. These spells would last for 1-2 minutes, originally only occurred after smoking a cigarette, but then began to happen when I would stand from a sitting position when not smoking, and I would need to sit back down until the headrush passed. This reaction occurred periodically up until one week before my second shot (01/23/2021), and I have not experiences it since, not even after my booster shot.  I understand  it may not be related, however, I have been smoking for 30-years and have never experienced a reaction such as this one before.

Vitals taken and heart rate was 133 and patient skin appeared flush. We added another 15 minutes on to her monitoring time, verbally calmed her and gave her a bottle of water. Her heart rate began to decrease to a normal rate range of 76-88 beats per minute. She stated she was starting to feel better. Within the 30 minute observation she complained of feeling &#34;funny&#34;. Her vitals were normal however she was very tearful and stated she had feeling of something bad about to happen. The patient was transferred to the exam room and lost conciouness according to the nurse caring for her. I observed the patient very groggy. Oxygen was applied and RN and RN administered Solumedrol and Epi intramuscularly. The patient was transported to the hospital via ambulance. The patient returned to the facility to pick up her car and stated she feels better and she received fluids at the hospital.

Five minutes after injection on 3/31/2021, c/o chest tightness followed by nausea and heaving.  Treated for anaphylaxis, transferred by ambulance to Medical Center; and discharged to home later that afternoon.  The employee worked her regular schedule 4/2/21 and 4/5/21 with no stated complaints.  On 4/6/21, received notification from the Employee that she was to be off work through 4/12/21 as her physician feels that the vaccine has damaged her heart.  She states she has a heart rate down to 38 BPM, experiences black outs, has left sided head pain and weakness.  Her personal physician is scheduling her for Holter Monitor and Echocardiogram.  Her physician has now stated she cannot work through 4/16/21.  I have no supporting written documentation from the physician for these medical concerns.

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on 1/1/21.  Initially, I had a sore arm for 24 hours but otherwise no problems.  Then, on day 8, my left deltoid area started itching and there was a red, slightly raised area just larger than a golf ball. I called the  hotline at that time and took a Benadryl.  Then, 24 hrs later, the area had expanded to over 3 times the size and felt warm. I actually went and saw a friend who lived in my neighborhood who is a general surgeon and he thought I should get it checked out to make sure it wasn&#39;t an NSTI.  Being Saturday at 9pm, I went to the ER  where they started me on Keflex/Bactrim for a presumed cellulitis.  By the next morning, the redness and itching were gone and my arm felt totally back to normal the next day after that. Unfortunately, on day 3 of the antibiotics (Tuesday the 12th), I had symptoms of anaphylaxis (chest tightness, wheezing, throat clearing, lip swelling, hoarse voice, impending doom sensation).  I took Benadryl 50mg and got my epi pen ready but did not use it.  (I have a tree nut allergy).  The symptoms resolved completely about 1 hour later.

                                                Nurse did hit a capillary and I bled immediately after injection- enough where it ran down my arm and went onto floor. I felt pretty okay except for the feeling of my arm hot and fuzzy and fuzzy fingers on my left hand until my &#34;leave time&#39; of 10:03 am. I stayed a little longer, and was home by 10:30 when I became extremely nauseous, dry heaving, left side of face numb. Headache started at 10:40. Tried calling medical facility but was on hold for soo long- no one answered so since I don&#39;t have insurance I decided to just rest and drink fluids. By 11:40 my face was back to normal, no longer nauseous but extremely lethargic and was the rest of the day. The following day I felt ok -slight swelling on my arm at injection site and a bruise that I still have.

My mouth also became severely dry and I felt dehydrated. I have a metallic taste and have pain when I take deep breaths. I blacked out at one point and can?t recall anything. My temp was 103 all night Saturday and I never slept. Sunday I woke up Dazed, Confused and dizzy. I was extremely light headed and out of it.  I had double vision and was running into everything.  My heart has been racing non stop with a feeling of severe anxiety.  Tuesday I woke up again with sharp pain in upper left back shoulder/armpit along with severe dry mouth which feels like dehydration. My head still hurts, but somewhat manageable.  Fast forward 10 days later and I?m still experiencing dizziness, rapid heart beat, anxiety, dry mouth, feel dehydrated and headache.

                                                The evening (3/20/21)I received the vaccine I noticed fatigue, headache and chills. The next morning I developed shortness of breath. The day after that my left left began swelling for no reason, was slightly discolored and warm to the touch. As the week went on my shortness of breath became greater and my leg more swollen. On (3/26/21) I sent to the ER by my doctor. Had a ultra sound and discovered an extensive DVT in my left groin down to behind left knee. Had a CT and discovered blood clots in my lungs. I had never had any underlying health conditions or been on medications, don&#39;t smoke, no complaints prior. Was transported to hospital spent 2.5 days in ICU before being moved to a regular bed for a total of (4) days hospitalized. The doctor installed two sheaths on each side of groin, injected my lungs with medication to blast/dissolve the clots and installed a filter in the main artery to catch any clots that may break away from leg. I was also put on a Heparin drip while in ICU. The next day the doctor went and the procedure was a success dissolving the clots. He removed the sheaths. I went back to ICU. The next day (3/28/21) a second utlra sound was done to left leg and DVT is still in left leg. Have been described Eliquis blood thinner.

                                                Became nauseous and started vomiting approximately 20 minutes after the vaccine. She initially refused to go to the emergency room by ambulance. The vomiting continued and she then passed out and became diaphoretic. 911 was called and she was transported to the emergency room. I later spoke with a nurse at the ER and tests were being ran. She said they did not feel it was vaccine related. She did say the doctor said she had a panic attack.

                                                At 4:00 am on Thursday morning (12 hours after vaccination),  I got up to use the bathroom and when I was finished, I fainted.  My mom heard the loud noise and found me on the bathroom floor and could not arouse me.  She called 911 and I came to when she was on the phone with them.  She helped me up and I felt weak and flush.  She gave me some cold towels and I felt better soon after.  She then took me to ER because I had a gash on my chin and my jaw was very sore.  I asked the ER doctor if my fainting could have something to do with the vaccine and he didn&#39;t think so.  He did a CT scan to check my jaw and an EKG and they were both normal.  I told him that I have been very busy at work the last week or so and I know that I haven&#39;t been eating or hydrating properly.

They did a chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan. Those tests showed two new pulmonary embolisms in the right lung and an old pulmonary embolism in the left lung. Patient was hospitalized 09-FEb-2021 until 12-Feb-2021.  She reported that her body was still inflamed. In her labs it showed her thyroid levels had doubled from her previously good thyroid levels checked in Oct 2020.   Treatment information was not provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, pain in her legs, hips, lower back, neck, jaw  bilateral arm pain, decrease in appetite, fever, pain in ribs and pulmonary embolism, were considered controlled with medication.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                came in to our store  for her COVID 19 vaccine appointment on 3/19/21 at 10:30am. On her VAR form, she indicated &#34;no&#34; on #5 that if she ever had a reaction after receiving a vaccination, including fainting or feeling dizzy questions on the VAR form. She also had history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.  We gave her Covid 19 vaccine and noticed she was nervous about the shot that she is getting. We ask her to stay in the pharmacy for at least 15 minutes for adverse reaction observation. About 5 minutes in while she was sitting , my technician noticing that the patient is not normal like she is about to faint and call the pharmacist on duty for attention. The pharmacist ran to the patient right away and noticed the patient starting to faint and unconcious, the pharmacist told technician on duty to call 911. We laid her down on the floor to see if we need to process CPR but she regained her concious and alert after about 30 seconds. The paramedic arrived within couple minutes and check her vital and they said her BP is low and she agreed to go to the  Hospital for check up. Paramedic took the patient with on stretcher.

                                                Patient&#39;s received 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine Friday 3/12.  Her husband reported she had not unexpected fatigue,  malaise, and fever for 1 day but better after that.  On Monday she began complaining of shortness of breath.  This progressively worsened and she started having presyncopal episodes.  On Saturday she was unable to come down the stairs in the house so husband planned to take her to the hospital but she stood up and passed out and woke up quickly.  He decided to call EMS.  By the time she presented to our hospital she was cyanotic and agonal breathing.  On moving her from EMS stretcher to ED bed she had PEA cardiac arrest.  She underwent mechanical device CPR with only brief (&lt;1 min) ROSC x1.  She at some point did have a shockable rhythm.  Cath lab was notified and she was taken emergently to the cath lab with ongoing mechanical device CPR.  Peripheral VA ECMO was placed after about 1.5 hours.  Pulmonary angiogram was done which showed massive saddle PE with near complete obliteration of the right pulmonary tree and some filling defects in the left tree as well.  At that time she had severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 24.  She also had no gag or corneal reflex, minimally responsive pupils, and no response to noxious stimuli.  Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted with some result.  She was transferred to the SICU with increasing pressor requirement, and DIC.  Ultimately, the venous catheter of the ECMO circuit malfunctioned thought to be secondary propagating IVC thrombosis.  Family decided to withdraw care and she passed away.

On  3/6/2021 at 11:24 AM I presented  with dizziness, slurred speech, a feeling of my lip dropping to the right, and weakness in left upper extremity.  Called my daughter whom arrived within 10 minutes. After asking me some questions and exercises she  said my strength in the left upper extremity was weak compared to the right.  My daughter took me to ER, at check in I said I think I had a stroke. I was admitted, and neurology was consulted. In the ER they called it a TIA, and after imaging a  diagnosis of stroke was made.    Acute frontoparietal infarct, ASA/plavix, lipitor, PT/OT, Neurologist follow up.    After discharge I have been meeting with PT/OT following exercises. Met with my PCP and continued medications Aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg. Still have muscle aches, and pain in the left upper extremity- especially 3rd and 5th digits.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving injection in right arm I felt a BOOM flush all over my body like I just had an IV Contrast.  Then I became dizzy, my heart started racing, I started cold sweats and felt tightness in my mid upper chest to the base of my throat.  The ED RN on site took my BP and HR and had me lie down because I felt that I couldn&#39;t breath.  She called paramedics who took my BP and HR, then did a 12 lead EKG.  They transported me to the ED.  I was worked up for cardiac, lung, chemistry.  My troponin-HS was slightly elevated and a cardiologist was called.  He did an echo on my heart, liver and right kidney -- normal.  Chest X-ray was normal.  A second 12 lead EKG was done, normal sinus.  Hematology, Chemistry was normal.  Was in the ED from 11:30 to 4:00 p.m.  Advised by ED Doctor, and Cardiologist, that it seems the stress of the anaphylaxis reaction stressed the heart which caused the spill of troponin.  Advised to see my cardiologist and get a stress test.  I have already informed my Primary Care Doctor and he has prescribed me an EPI-PEN to carry.  I have no history of allergic reactions/anaphylaxis reactions to vaccines.  I am up to date with all other vaccines and just had my yearly flu shot in November 2020.  This was my first allergic reaction/anaphylaxis reaction to a vaccine.

                                                Patient a 46 yo female with a history of Bechet&#39;s presenting to the ED yesterday due to a history of progressive bruising with later appearance of petechiae and gum bleeding.   CBC yesterday revealed an isolated thrombocytopenia with platelets of 19k (&gt;340k all previous checks), suspected ITP.  She was given 1 unit of platelets, solumedrol x 1 and IVIG.  Platelets this morning have responded but more likely related to the platelet transfusion.    Today I discussed continuation of IVIG and transitioning over to pulse dexamethasone 40 mg x 4 days q 14 days for 4 cycles in order to put the ITP in remission.   Considerations for precipitating event leading to the ITP include autoimmune condition recently undergoing dose adjustment, history of recent infection (viral gastroenteritis), and post Covid 19 vaccination induced ITP-currently described incidence between 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 and seen between 1-3 wks after vaccination.     This is unlikely to be related to vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) as there is no sign of clotting.  In addition she received an mRNA vaccine (Moderna) which has not been reported to cause VITT. A HIT antibody was sent.

Monitored for approximately 30 minutes and then released. Abdominal pain started 3 hours after vaccination. Pain worsened and became severe over several hours, peaking with other flu-like symptoms and decreased over the next several days as other symptoms decreased. Pain was worse on left side about half way up rib cage and lasted for 5 days. Abdominal pain was worse and sharpened when twisting, rolling or bending torso.  I can still feel a pulling sensation under ribs on left side off and on.  Also starting about 15 hours after vaccination I had brownish colored urine that lasted about 36 hours.  Saw FNP 10 days after vaccination. CBC, liver &amp; kidney function blood work &amp; urine dip stick tests all normal.  They could not feel any enlargement on physical examination, but suspect spleen issue

                                                I passed out 12 hours after vaccine received while standing in the bathroom. This followed hours of terrible chills and muscle aches that I couldn?t sleep through. No medications were taken until after the episode and it didn?t happen again. I did not have a working thermometer so unsure how high my temp got. I peed myself when fainted. My husband was present to pick me up off the floor and luckily I didn?t hurt myself in the fall. I didn?t come to until he took me back to bed. I started feeling better a few hours later and much better by 24 hours. Now just lingering body aches and fatigue at 48 hours and still taking ibuprofen/Tylenol.

                                                Tightening of throat as I was walking to waiting area, chest palpitations, dizziness, fainting, and vomiting.  They were not prepared for this to happen. All people that where were calling anyone to come and help me and finally and ICU doctor came and took over my care asking for benadryl from the pharmacy, a stretcher to take me to ER. Stretcher arrived was put on it and an IV was put in my right arm and the benadryl was administer in which I felt I was burning and turn real red. They then proceeded to take me to ER, where they administered more medicine through the IV.  I was there for about 4 1/2 hours. When i was released my throat was still very tight, felt very fatigue, muscle ached, shortness of breath and dizzy. I was sent home with an EPI PEN, Allegra, and pepcid. I also had a referral to see the allergist doctor who  could see me on Tuesday 1/19/2021 because Monday was a Holiday.

                                                Received vaccine at 2:40pm with no immediate side effects. At 7pm woke up with a rapid heartrate. Rapid heart rate continued and led to symptoms of nausea, sweating, cramping , and feeling like i was going to pass out.  At that time i was concerned enough to consider going to hospital for treatment but was not in reach of a phone. Laid on floor and woke up within a few minutes. Once regained consciousness  felt fine. Did not receive any medical treatment as similar reactions have occurred with MMR vaccines and Flu vaccines. Approx 5-7 days of Arm pain/ache was the only additional symptom.

                                                Four hours post vaccine I had muscle and joint pain throughout my entire body and I took 600 mg Advil.  Four hours after that I repeated the 600 mg dose of Advil and went to bed.  I felt feverish and my pain did not diminish despite the medication.  At approximately 2 am I got up to try and cool myself off.  I fainted in my bathroom and fell, hitting my head on the tub, although I did not know this at the time.  I thought I just laid down.  I was unable to get up.  For the next 2 hours I slowly inched myself from the bathroom into the hallway and towards my bed.  I was very cold and in severe pain.  When I reached my bed I finally warmed up and fell asleep.  I was unable to get up out of the bed, except to raise myself on my right elbow to drink a mouthful of water, until approximately 4 pm the following day.   This was 28 hours after the vaccine.  No medications helped my pain, it just slowly subsided on it&#39;s own.      For the next 24 hours I was able to get up and use the bathroom and drink some water and juice but I could not eat or perform any function. I could not even sit up in bed.  When I was able to start eating again I had diarrhea for 24 hours.  It has been 5 complete days since the vaccine.  I am still winded while performing simple cleaning tasks.  I need about 2 hours of rest in bed (twice yesterday) just to get through a day with nothing in it.   I did not expect the level of immobility/illness, unalleviated pain or the seriousness of my second vaccine reaction.

I presented to my PCP&#39;s office for evaluation on Thursday; February 4 and was sent for an ultrasound at Imaging. Ultrasound of right leg showed 2 DVT&#39;s. I was started on Pradaxa but experienced an adverse reaction (excessive bleeding with menstruation) which resulted in an emergency room visit on 2/8/2021 and 2 additional days of prescribed bed rest.

She then came back to the pharmacy and sat in a chair for 30 minutes and had some water and crackers. Patient was still concerned and waited for 2 hours in the nearby hospital parking lot until she felt strong enough to return home. Reported a slight headache for the rest of the day.

                                                2/5 I received the 1st does of Moderna. The next day I had a massive headache. As the days went on my neck started to heart. The days continued and my back started to hurt. I thought my pain was just radiating down my back from my neck. ON 2/12 I have record of going to the pharmacy to get Lidocain patches. I continued on with pain from neck to middle of back. I made appointments with chiropractor and went there complaining that my back and ribs were out. This continued. On 3/5 I got the 2nd dose. I reacted as expected but this went on for 4 days. Went to a convenient care clinic where the dr ordered chest xray and D-DImer for suspected PEs. I got a call immediately to go to ER as my D-Dimer was high at 4.3. I went back to Local ER and had a CT Scan. The CT scan showed MULTIPLE PEs with infarct. I was admitted. SInce then I have been back to the ER and still struggling and have many tests coming up. My pulse is consistantly tachycardia. The ER docs do not want to entertain the thought that is was the vaccine because i was a smoker and on hormone replacement therapy. HOWEVER, I smoked for over 30 years and was on that HRT for almost 3 and never showed any signs of a clotting issue. I can pinpoint with pictures, and bank records of when the pain started and it reflects back to the 1st dose.  Who knows but after the 2nd does and out of the hospital I struggled with covid symptoms including the &#34;foggy&#34; head and that continues as well as other health related PE issues.  They may not want to contribute it to the vaccine but I know when this all started and it does need to be reported incase others. I have a whole story to tell that doesn&#39;t cover in writing!

I called my doctor the next day (Mon April 5) and they got me in that day and I went to the hospital the same day for an ultrasound. The hospital confirmed I had a blood clot in my lower leg.

                                                I went to bed Friday night around 10:00PM.  I woke around 12:30AM with a throbbing headache, sore throat, post-nasal drainage, body aches, chills, fever, sweating, weakness and nausea.  I went down to use the bathroom and then back to bed but could not sleep due to the throbbing headache and chills.  I got back up around 2:30AM and soaked in a warm bath.  I went back to bed around 4:30AM.  I was able to go to sleep.  I slept until around 8:30AM.  At that time, I drank some water and went back to sleep.  I slept until approximately 10:30AM and started drinking Powerade Zero.  The Powerade was taken to bed and sipped on when I would stir and change positions.  I slept until approximately 2:30PM, when I got up to use the bathroom.  I urinated, washed my hands and went to walk out of the bathroom when everything went black.  I remember yelling for my husband but then nothing else until I heard him yell my name several times and I was lying on the floor in the doorway of the bathroom.  I passed out.  I was sat up in the recliner and monitored.  Above symptoms continued.  Tylenol and Motrin were alternated every 4 hours for the fever.

She was immediately sent to the Hospital ED and repeat CBC confirmed the critically low platelet count.  She is currently hospitalized and she has received platelet transfusions but her platelet count is still critically low.  She is also receiving steroids and immunoglobulin and is under the care of MD (Heme/Onc)

                                                After shot one ( left arm) on 01/08/2021 I had severe joint and muscle pain, fevers, chills, exhaustion, nausea and shooting pain down my left arm and up to my neck and back of skull from afternoon of injection on Friday to Sunday night. I slept all weekend.  After shot two (right arm) on 02/05/21 I had all of those same reactions by early Friday afternoon. I woke up at 10:00 pm with the need to vomit. While sitting on the edge of my bath tub waiting to vomit, I fainted and fell backwards into the bathtub, hitting me head and wrenching my neck as I was wedged into the tub sideways. My son found me and roused me. I then urinated all over myself, had extreme diarrhea and vomiting x 2 rounds. I fainted a second time while sitting on the toilet with diarrhea and vomited 2x more into my bathtub.

Everyone thinks I should also mention that I was admitted to the hospital with chest pain, high BP/Pulse on 3/31, they did a D-Dimer on me and it was elevated, suggesting a clot has formed and is in the process of breaking down. I had a CT of my chest and no PE was found, but I had thickening of my left lobar pulmonary artery wall, further supporting the suggestion of a possible blood clot. After an echo stress test, I was discharged the next day on HTN meds. I was experiencing chest discomfort prior to my vaccine, but again, EVERYONE is telling me I need to report this, so I am. :)

Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Patient did not state yes to anything other than having a reaction that was managed at home to shellfish as a child. They stated their throat had swollen as a child during the event. Patient was told that it was an anaphylactic reaction and shouldn&#39;t have been managed at home as a child by nurse and should have been taken to the hospital. Patient was told they would be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. Within 2-3 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient reported tingling or burning around the site of injections. Within 5 minutes they stated to be feeling tired and that their arm had felt numb. After this the patient began starring into the distance and was unresponsive. Called for help and advice by turning around as patient had syncoped. Got nurses and other team members attention and had an epi-pen ready just in case it was needed. Patient began having notable distress with respiration and administed an epi-pen. Advised for a nurse to call EMS for patient and crash cart/oxygen was also obtaine dby the facility. Oxygen was required. Patient was not responsive after the first dose and was given a second as they remained un-alert with notable distress. The patient became alert a while after receiving the second shot and not long after that the EMS arrived to the event.

I had been asleep, but woke up feeling nauseous, got out of bed to get to the bathroom and my husband said I collapsed, stiffened and had spasms, when I regained consciousness, I had buzzing in my ears, and couldn&#39;t feel my extremities for a few minutes.

I fell flat on my back. My husband rushed to me and helped me up because I started throwing up. At that point I had memory issues. I did not know how old I was nor what month it was.  My husband called 911 and I was having tachycardia. They took me to the hospital.

                                                Patient post vaccine administration approx 20 minutes. Reported feelinging tightness in chest, spreading to throat. Patient was taken to observation portion of clinic. Patient was hypoxic in 70&#39;s. Supplemental oxygen applied. Oxygen saturation increased to 88. Epipen administered and albuterol nebulizer treatment started while waiting for ED/Rapid response team to arrive. Patient transferred to ED for further observation.  From the physician that treated the patient: &#34;It was a bit of a bizarre presentation. She reported throat tightness after the vaccine. She had a completely normal exam and no other complaints. no signs of airway/oral/pharyngeal abnormality. no respiratory abnormality. Unfortunately she was significantly hypoxic when I took her vitals. as low as 76%. Good waveform. I even checked the pulse ox on myself because I didn&#39;t believe it. In addition, with supplemental oxygen, her sats went up. I had to pull the trigger and treat her even though she looked well and I had no objective exam findings to explain her profound hypoxia. She received IM Epinepherine and Albuterol neb. By the time she was in ED she was satting 100% and her throat tightness resolved. So, not sure how to answer your question. Clinically I pulled the trigger and treated her for anaphylaxis following a vaccine administration. I wish it was a problem with my sat monitor but I don&#39;t believe it was. I was using a life-pack with wave form and verified with two other people that the O2 saturation function was working properly. Intuitively, it doesn&#39;t make sense but I think we should probably consider it a reaction to the vaccine. &#34;

This then turned into full left side numb/foggy feeling. I was with my son (and I&#39;m a nurse) so I asked him to test for signs of a stroke. I could smile evenly but it didn&#39;t feel like it. I had strength in both hands and could lift my arms. I was able to communicate what to look for to my son without slurred speech. But I was not stable on my left foot and felt as if I was listing to the left side. My left side was foggy. I moved my arm but flet it in slow motion. When I got home, I sat down and stretched. The symptoms went away and I was able to continue the day without episode. The episode lasted 20-30 minutes as I was walking home still. In hind sight, I did have a similar eposide after the first dose (Moderna lot 037K20A on 1/29/20) while exercising at home but sat down and thought it was due to a hard workout. That time it was just a weak left leg that was giving out on me and lasted 5 minutes because I stopped the workout.

Woke up around 1:30am arm hurting so I got up to get some more tylenol. I immediately felt sick to my stomach (both ways) and I passed out and broke my nose.  I was coherient at times and other times I could not seem to answer any questions. My husband got me to the ER and they took my blood pressure 4 or 5 times and the nurse said &#34;I can&#39;t get a blood pressure&#34;. Another nurse came in and said we will take this one ! My blood pressure had bottomed out and caused all sorts of things going on. I left ER after 4 1/2 hrs. with a BP of 107/57 but I am not sure how low it got! At one point my husband looked at monitor and my bottom number was 39 but it is all a blur to me. As of today I still feel week (heavy arms) and I am concerned about taking my second dose!

At 10pm I started feeling light headed and walked to the kitchen to get water. I began feeling weak and more dizzy and went back to my bedroom to lie down. I felt a rush to my head, passed out and woke up on the ground. I am unsure how long I lost consciousness:  minutes/ seconds.  I was able to get to my bed and called my husband for help. I broke into a hot, drenching sweat to the point I had to change my clothes.  The dizziness eventually cleared. I have a headache and am still nauseated today but not dizzy.  I have never had an experience like this before.

                                                After Receiving the second dose on February 9, 2021 I was very ill.  Chills, fever, tired, achy.  The next day I was great.  Then, 9 days later my left side went numb.  My arm, leg and face went numb. 20 minutes later all feeling did come back.  I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a TIA.  I had many tests completed.  (MRI, EKG, CT SCAN, Echocardiogram)    The only thing that was found was that I have a PFO in the heart.  I am healthy, I eat great, exercise daily at the gym.  AFter an overnight hospital stay and being put on PLAVAX and aspirin my life has changed forever.  I had a doctor&#39;s appointment to discuss the PFO, a meeting with a neurologist and they are not sure why.  The paperwork shares that I had a TIA or a migraine which is not possible because I do know what migraines are like as I had these as a young child. I am now looking into closing the PFO.  I am going to get a second opinion on this based on what happened.

I couldn&#39;t get my legs underneath me, I couldn&#39;t push myself up with my arms. I had to call a friend to come help me get to my bed. It took me 15 minutes to scoot myself to get to the front door. It took another 10 to try to unlock it. I spent the next 2 days in bed very fatigued with my legs feeling like jelly. I am still very fatigued but getting better every day. I was also experiencing hot and cold chills for about 2 weeks after the vaccine.  I did not seek any medical treatment.

                                                The vaccine was administered and the patient said they were starting to feel lightheaded within 2 minutes of receiving it. The patient then fainted in the chair with their head back and their tongue out of their mouth. I was trying to wake the patient up to clarify whether the patient was having trouble breathing or if any part of her mouth or throat was swelling, but I could not wake the patient. Both arms were very red. It sounded like labored breathing for about 30 seconds once I got in the room and then the patient stopped making noise. I could not hear any breaths so I administered one dose of 0.3 mg epinephrine in an Epipen.

Patient reports feeling fatigued, having cough, and feeling more short of breath for the last day, and has developed central chest pain which is pleuritic in the emergency department.  She reports that the chest pain is 4/10 in severity and does not radiate.  Her caregiver at bedside reports that the patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for the last 3 or so weeks.  Of note, she becomes dyspneic with limited exertion, such as going up a flight of stairs, at baseline.  She had a fever of 101.4 °F at home earlier today, but denies chills or diaphoresis.  He had 1 episode of nonbloody vomiting earlier today.  Denies nausea at this time.  She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday, 4 weeks after the first.   They note that approximately 5 years ago, she had a prolonged admission for which she was transferred to OHSU and was on ECMO for a time before making a nearly full recovery.  She has had the baseline dyspnea on exertion since that time.   Review of Systems  Constitutional: Positive for fever and malaise/fatigue. Negative for chills.  HENT: Negative for sore throat.

There is hazy reticulonodular interstitial opacity seen within the left mid and both lower lung zones suspicious for interstitial pulmonary edema. CARDIAC: Slightly worsened mild cardiomegaly. MEDIASTINUM: Normal. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. LINES/TUBES: None. BONES: There is mild rightward convexity curvature of the thoracic spine along with minimal multilevel degenerative change. OTHER: Surgical clips overlie the left lung apex medially and the right upper abdominal quadrant.   IMPRESSION: 1. See above.   CT angiogram pulmonary:  FINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  -Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.

A week post vaccination, she had a thick painful cord down injection arm and was misdiagnosed with tendonitis. After a second opinion, she was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. On 01FEB2021, an ultrasound confirmed a blood clot and subsequently, she went to the ER. A computerized tomography (CT) of the lungs ruled out pulmonary embolism. Based on these events, the patient chose not to get the second shot.  Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.   The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the event.   The outcome of the events deep vein thrombosis and chose not to get second shot were unknown.   Follow-up information received 08Feb2021 included additional event, date of first dose was updated from 16Jan2021 to 07Jan2021, diagnostic test and treatment.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 50 year-old, female who experienced deep vein thrombosis. Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

Another wave of severe nausea occurred and then my husband helped me sit up and lean on the toilet to vomit, and I lost consciousness again for 3 to 4 seconds.  Layed on the floor again for a bit, then made it to bed.  At 5 am had another wave of nausea and vomiting and started to have a bowel movement and vomit at the same time and lost consciousness again for a few seconds, my husband had to prop up my head.  I was able to make it into bed and then the symptoms gradually subsided.  I was able to eat around noon.  My husband and I are both physicians so didn&#39;t seek medical care.

I became nauseated and then fainted, smacking the back of my head on the bathroom floor. I took naproxen (220mg) for the fever and returned to bed. At around 8am I got up and my fever was 101F and stayed at that temp for 24 hours. I fainted again and blacked out for about 30 seconds.  I stayed in bed all day.  My fever broke by Sunday morning and I started to feel better by midday.

                                                I had the usual flu-like symptoms starting around 9 pm the day of the vaccination 24th) - headache, chills, lethargy, loss of appetite, injection site pain. I didn&#39;t notice anything else overnight, exception injection site pain increased. The next morning I got up around 6:45 am to feed my pets. I felt woozy walking about 25 m from the bedroom to the pet food location, and also very flushed and hot. I started sweating copiously while I was getting the food out, and then I fainted. I don&#39;t know how long I was unconscious but I suspect not more than a minute or two. I didn&#39;t seem to injure myself when I fell, other than a bruised elbow and hip I was able to finish feeding the pets, crawl to the bathroom (I had a strong accompanying urge to evacuate my bowels), and then get into bed. I went back to sleep at around 7:15 am and by 10:00 am I felt more normal, still with some chills and headache, general lethargy, and not much appetite. Those symptoms lasted through the evening until I went to bed at 9:00 pm, gradually decreasing. Today I feel mostly fine, although dehydrated. I did not record my temperature during the fever spike, nor receive medical attention.

                                                Lost consciousness and hit the floor from a seated position. Most likely vasovagal syncope which I have experienced previously. Dizziness and vertigo passed in about 15 minute and I safely left. 6 hours later I am experiencing some lightheadedness.

                                                I got the shot and waited for 15 minutes. My arm started hurting really bad that evening and it lasted until day two. During the night I felt really dizzy. I got up during the night and I fainted. We called an ambulance my blood pressure was a little low. I went to my Primary care doctor the next morning. My brain was foggy, and I was a little confused. The doctor checked my blood pressure, and it did not change on standing. I saw my allergist and he is going to run tests to check for allergies to ingredients in the vaccine. I have not taken the second dose.

                                                I had stomach pain about 2 hours after the injection. I went to sleep at 10 pm and woke up at 2 am to go to the bathroom. My legs felt like I could barely move them but I was able to go the bathroom. Once I got up and walked toward the bathroom door I hit my head into the door. I ended up on the floor. I sat up and my husband came in. He said I was mumbling incoherently and then passed out for about 28 seconds. He said my arms were moving up and down while passed out. I woke up covered in sweat and he put me in bed. I slept until 8 am and then woke up with a headache, nausea, body aches and dizziness. The headache and dizziness lasted until 3/18/21.

I quickly pulled over to a gas station and called 911.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported me via ambulance to the hospital.  En route, I was administered 50 mg of Benadryl.  Diagnosis was anaphylactic reaction to vaccine.

She was then transferred to Emergency Department. Per their report: The patient presents with a swollen discolored left lower leg.  She does have  discoloration and I am concerned for massive DVT and cerulea dolens.  She does  have really minimal pain to the leg except to the groin, she has intact pulses,  I have low suspicion for acute ischemia/arterial clot.  She does complain of  some mild dyspnea with exertion above baseline so I do have concerns for  possible PE.  She is hemodynamically stable, appears in no distress.  She is on  oral contraceptives, mild obesity, no other significant VTE risk factors.  I am  going to empirically start her on heparin, I have also ordered a CT PE and a CT  abdomen pelvis to check for proximal propagation of the DVT along with a left  lower extremity duplex Doppler ultrasound.    Duplex ultrasound also showed extensive left lower extremity DVT up to the  common femoral, she does have bilateral PEs without evidence of significant clot  burden or heart strain, she is hemodynamically stable with normal pulse  oximetry.  The patient also has clots proximal up to her IVC.  I discussed this  with Dr.  of vascular surgery for possible thrombolysis therapy of the  left lower extremity.  She was discussed with SOUND for admission.

Next recollection was regaining awareness, clothes soaked with sweat. Was lying on a bed with no recollection of being moved to the bed. Shakes and feeling of distress. Experienced shakes and a tingling sensation for approximately 15 minutes. Once that subsided I experienced chills for the better part of an hour. Would like to add, I have no phobias of injections and regularly have blood samples drawn for medical evolutions with my primary care physician.

She denied any rash, feeling of swelling in her throat or tongue and had no trouble breathing. Patient declined to have EMTs called because she did not feel it was anaphylaxis.  A dose of 50mg of Benadryl was via orally and she was closely monitored.  Her blood preassure was 128/84 and heart rate was 80.  She had offers to drive her to either the ER or urgent care but declined saying it was isolated to her lips and the tip of her tongue.  Patient is a nurse and was aware of what to watch for.  Pharmacy staff continued to observe her for an additional 45 minutes.  At that time she said the issues were resolving and she would like to go home.  She was counseled on what to look for with worsening reaction but said she felt more frustrated that anything.  Pharmacist encouraged her to reach out to her PCP and also explained we would be unable to give her the next shot at a clinic.  She was advised to speak more with her doctor regarding if she should get a second dose.  Patient was followed up with 2 hours after vaccination by phone and reported symptoms resolved and she was just tired from the Benadryl.  Patient was also called the day after and said she had a bad headache but otherwise no other signs of adverse reaction.

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

I went to the bathroom and thought I would be sick, but I remember being so dizzy that I went to lay on the floor by the toilet but my husband said he heard a thud, and came to find me passed out. Then I was shaking  (a vaso vagel response I guess) til I came to. The ems came, but everything was fine, so I elected to stay home. I threw up a 1/2 hour later and then felt better, and slept for a few hours. The rest of the day I was just exhausted. Today I woke up feeling fine! Just wanted to report the episode in case you track vomiting and dizziness and fainting.

                                                I suffered what seemed to be a seizure on Friday 2/24. It was witnessed by my adult daughter. I was seated on a sofa, my eyes closed and I lost consciousness. My daughter reported that my arms went back and forth as did my head. I woke back up and felt dizzy but fine otherwise. I have never had a seizure or anything like that happen to me on the past. I did have all flu like symptoms (fever, chills, body aches, headache) 12 hours post vaccine which I expected to happen. All of these flu like symptoms  occurred 2/23 and were essentially gone by 2/24.  I am not reporting the flu like symptoms as ?adverse ?. I am simply reporting the seizure like activity that occurred approximately 1:00 pm  on 2/24.  I did not seek medical attention but I am following up with my doctor. No more seizures have occurred.

Some hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills, headache, started vomiting and my blood pressure started bottoming up that is when I was rushed to the ER. I was admitted and stayed 2 days. They said it was not related to the vaccine. First they told me it was sepsis. Then they told me it was pneumonia, not sepsis. Then said it was a bacterial infection. I sincerely do not know what I had. I am doing better now. My PCP did not recommend me to receive the second dose.

In the morning, I was up walking and started to not feel right due to the dizziness and fainted. After 6 days of feeling this way, I contacted my PCP and had a virtual visit. I was given a step down dose of Prednisone and a medication for the dizziness. My PCP advised me that I needed to report my reaction to this vaccine to the CDC. I contacted my Manager and also had to contact the nurse here.

And, was diagnosed with breast cancer in October of 2019, surgery in February 2020, followed by 5 weeks of radiation therapy. The type of breast cancer I had was due to hormones, so any hormones in my body could potentially cause a recurrence of the cancer.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA received on Saturday.  Sunday morning in the middle of my sleep, I woke feeling hot and sweaty, slightly nauseated, and like I had to defecate.  I stood up, felt like low blood pressure but wanted to get to the bathroom.  I walked towards the door, opened the door and fainted, falling backwards.  My spouse  states I was pale,staring at the ceiling and kind of stiff in my arms and legs for about 3 minutes.  He spoke to me, checked my pulse, covered me, poked my feet. As I came back to awareness I tried to speak and was unintelligible but then became more conscious.  He tested me with questions to make sure I was ok.  I defecated after that but did not vomit.  I was tired the rest of the day and napped for several hours.  I don&#39;t seem to have hurt anything in the fall.  I am instructed to be off work Monday by my supervisor.

                                                a couple hours after the vaccine, I experienced a bit of rapid heart rate, which resolved after a few minutes. The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

Eventually it stopped the following day, every now and then on the following day I would repeat it but not as often.

Within just a couple of minutes she was losing consciousness.  911 was called and EMT came within 5-8 minutes and patient was on floor.  EMT assessed patient and transported to local hospital (Medical Center).  Patient was seen and discharged and the physician at the hospital did not feel the seizure was a result of the vaccination but her medical condition and history of seizures.

                                                Patient vaccinated on 1/22.  The next morning (1/23), patient experienced diminished sensory and motor function in left arm and leg, as well as facial numbness.  Presented to the hospital on 1/24, and was found to have a small stroke in pontine medullary junction.  Discharged on 1/25.  There is some suspicion that her COVID infection in December may have precipitated this, and patient is currently being evaluated for coagulation disorders, primarily antiphospholipid antibody testing.  It is unlikely that the vaccine contributed to this, but given close timeline between the two, filing this report.

After talking to others that have had the vaccine, several have had breakthrough bleeding a couple days after the vaccine and thought nothing of it, but people aren&#39;t reporting because they think its just them. I think it should be reported, and maybe some investigation  follow up as to why this may have occurred.

                                                On 1/8/21, the day after the vaccination I developed a headache, nausea, fatigue, chills and cognitive impairment.  I quickly started vomiting  which was intense and persistent.  I had no food in my system so vomiting was mostly dry heaves, bile and what ever water I could drink.   Shortly after the vomiting began, I believe I passed out, fell and hit my head on the floor.   I don&#39;t remember falling but my husband said he heard the fall and I developed a large lump/bruise on my forehead.  The persistent vomiting lasted about 4-5 hours and other symptoms gradually improved.  1/11/21 I still have a milder headache, slight nausea and some fatigue.

I was standing, brushing teeth, felt weak from the inside out. I was leaning over the vanity, I hit the floor. My husband came in, I tore my non displaced fracture of clavicle; partial tear of rotator cuff and AC sprain.  It took me a bit to &#39;come to&#39;, laid there for a little bit. I felt weak, shoulder pain. I had a HA for 3 weeks, neck injury. Don&#39;t know if due to vaccine or injury from syncope.

                                                I received injection at approx. 1:30 on 02/20/21.  No issues.  At around 5-6PM started to feel tired.  Went to bed around 9 PM.  Woke at around 4 AM to go to bathroom felt fine upon awakening,  Once in bathroom felt nauseated, and dizzy.  Washing hands felt REALLY nauseated, next thing I know, my husband is hovered over me, as I had passed out unconscious onto bathroom floor.  I landed on my left side.  No blood.  Started immediately with visiable chills, and fever accompanied by headache and dizziness.  Fever lasted until Wednesday mid morning.  Dizzy lightheadedness, and Headache is still on going.  Primary care Dr. had X-rays, and MRI to rule out broken bones and/or concussion.  Tests confirmed I had not broken anything, and I had not a concussion.   Dr. suspects the issues I am experiencing are from vaccine reaction.

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Computerised tomogram: Inconclusive. In March 2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: Inconclusive.   The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.  No treatment information was provided.   Patient reports an MRI and CT scan was done, and she was informed that they suspected she had a small cot that went through and resolved on its own.  Company Comment: Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However patient&#39;s hx of familial hypercholesterolemia, peripheral arterial disease and stent placement are confounding factors that may play a possible contributory role.

However the patient was diagnosed with a positive COVID-19 test on January 4, 2021.  Patient complained of nausea, vomiting, back pain, and sharp chest pain.     On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture). She was taken to the hospital that evening on February 8, 2021. Patuent experienced a second seizure while at the hospital during a CT scan. Patient later was able to come home February 11, 2021 in the afternoon. Patient now has to wear a neck brace for up to 12 weeks, cannot drive, cannot work for up to 12 weeks, and is still recovering cognitively from the concussion.

                                                Moderna #1 vaccine given at 130pm March 11th 2021. Pt had history of asthma and frequent nebulizer use and had it in car with her for drive-thru vaccine clinic we did at location, which has a large parking lot. We gave 80 doses. Pt checked off anaphylaxis on the intake form so Dr spoke to her and she changed it to no history of anaphylaxis and only has history of asthma. So we gave her the vaccine. About 5 minutes later in car parking lot she started to use her personal nebulizer. I saw her in passenger side of car using a personal nebulizer so I talked to her and her daughter to find out what was going on. They said she has exacerbations all the time and this was not out of ordinary for her. I checked pulse ox and did a lung exam, etc, and she was stable.  She seemed baseline according to history by her and her daughter.  As she seemed at baseline and clinically was comfortable and conversant whole time, and she felt better after her nebulizer, I told them to have a low threshold for going to ER or calling 911 if her asthma was worse or different than her usual symptoms.  They agreed. According to daughter, she did well until about 24 hours the next day. The daughter said she was fine and she went to store and when she returned EMTs were intubating patient and apparently the patient used her epipen and called 911 herself. Approximate time of expiration was 230pm on March12th 2021.

She didn&#39;t notice anything herself, but her son and husband noticed that something was wrong.  The next morning she got up and her face was swollen on the right side and she could then tell that something was different.  She went to work and the nurse at work suggested that she get it checked out.  She went to the doctor and they diagnosed her with Bell&#39;s palsy on Friday, 2/12/21.  The doctor told her to come back on Saturday to ensure that it didn&#39;t worsen, it did not change.  The doctor ordered a CAT scan and she had that done, and then she wanted to confer with another doctor she wanted her to get an MRI.  She got that done, and told her that she had a mini-stroke from the vaccine.  They initially put her on Prednisone thinking it was Bell&#39;s palsy.  Saturday evening she took her 2nd dose of that, but told her not to take it anymore as that was not the issue.   The doctors then said that they saw some pneumonia, and is being treated for that.  She goes back to see the doctor this afternoon.

On 05-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized on 10-Apr-2021 due to PULMONARY EMBOLISM. At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) outcome was unknown.            No concomitant medications reported.  The patient developed a blood clot in the lower left lung, and was hospitalized. The doctor told her that because of cancer, radiation and recent mastectomy surgery she was at risk of developing blood clots. Treatment medication included apixaban for six months. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Company Comment: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s underlying cancer, radiation and recent mastectomy surgery were considered to be risk factors for developing blood clots.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Arm started to feel sore as the day went on and was very sore by nighttime. Next day, arm started to feel better and over the next 3 days was no longer sore.  On the morning of the 30th, woke up feeling fine, took a 3.5 mile walk and felt fine. Around 12:30 pm, experienced sudden pain and a burning sensation in the chest and both upper arms. Thought it was possibly heartburn ; took a Prilosec. The discomfort (mild but steady) continued so checked blood pressure which was 141/91. Called cardiologist and went to emergency room per instruction, around 1:30. Admitted overnight with the diagnosis of a mild heart attack and performed a heart catheterization where they found no major blockage. One artery noted 30% blocked but that overall heart function looked good. Discharged on 12/31/2020. -reported by patient via email, on 1/3/2021 @ 4:49pm

The pain in my right arm and around the back of my head and neck increased all day on Saturday, latter that night the pain woke me out of my sleep, and as I attempted to go to the restroom, I passed out.  I woke up on the floor where I had passed out face down, with a busted bloody lip and bruises and broken skin on both knees.  Very frightening, Thank God that I woke up because I live alone.   Thank you.

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

                                                Pneumonia; Partial left lung collapsed; Injection site cellulitis, red rash around injection site which was tender and itchy; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, who was a 58-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced injection site cellulitis, red rash around injection site which was tender and itchy (injection site cellulitis), cough, pneumonia, and partial left lung collapse (pneumothorax).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 04 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the right arm for COVID-19 infection.  On an unspecified date, a few days after vaccination administration, the patient experienced red rash around the injection site which was tender and itchy and was diagnosed by a nurse as cellulitis, which later resolved.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient began coughing.   On 18 Jan 2021, the patient went to urgent care for a COVID-19 test and the results came back negative. The patient was prescribed dexamethasone for three days, but symptoms did not improve. She again went to urgent care where X-rays was performed which showed pneumonia and partial left lung collapse, she was prescribed erythromycin.   On 24 Jan 2021, patient went to emergency room and was given amoxicillin and advised to see their doctor.   On 27 Jan 2021, her doctor prescribed prednisone and the symptoms started to get better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported, although the patient expressed concern about getting the second injection.  The outcome of events, cough, pneumonia, and partial left lung collapse (pneumothorax), was reported and resolving. The event, injection site cellulitis, red rash around injection site which was tender and itchy, was reported as resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the report lacks critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications.  Noting that cellulitis and pneumonia are usually caused by an infectious agent, both events are considered unlikely associated with mRNA-1273. Pneumothorax is confounded by the pneumonia.

I got up to go to the bathroom and passed out.  My husband helped me to the bed and got me some orange juice.  I then experienced extreme uncontrollable shaking for about 10 minutes.   The next day, I had a sore arm where the vaccine was administered.  I have only had one flu vaccine in my whole life.  I am not allergic to anything that I know about.  I have had problems with passing out and have been diagnosed with vasovagal syncope.   However, I have not passed out in over 10 years.

                                                At 12:30 am awoke and felt thirsty and achy in my right arm.   I had been feeling chills off and on for a couple of hours.   I got out of bed and went to the kitchen, drank a small amount of water and located the bottle of Tylenol.   While I was attempting to open the safety seal on the Tylenol I suddenly felt very dizzy and immediately passed out.   I awoke on the floor moments later and passed out a second time.  After awaking the second time,  I remained still and waited a few minutes for the dizziness to go away.    I then carefully  crawled back to bed without standing.     I continued to fill chills throughout the night and the next day (3/10/2021) , as well as fatigue.  The following day (3/11/2021)  the symptoms all seemed to disappear, except for bumps and bruises I sustained in the fall.

I went back on 20th - and they did x-rays - I had pneumonia and a partial lung collapse. On the 20th, They put me on antibiotics and an inhaler. On the 24th I went back to ER, I wasn&#39;t any better. They put me on a different antibiotic. On the 27th, I went back to the doctor  - because I was still coughing really bad and they put me on a different steroid. I was back to work on February 1st. I still have a cough - it hasn&#39;t ever gone away.  I still have to use the inhaler. I never had a cough before this and haventh had to use  inhaler.

Went home and within another 20 minutes had completely lost voice.  Went back to Urgent Care.  Was told again to keep an eye on it or go to ER.  They didn&#39;t even look at me.  My own Doctor was down the street so I went right to her office.  My doctor was not in, so another doctor came right out to look at me.  She checked my breathing and it was okay but I could not speak at all.  She put me on prednisone and Benadryl for several days.  Eventually felt better after meds.  Made appointment with allergist, for follow-up.   He said it was an anaphylaxis reaction.  Was told to not get second dose of Moderna shot. I have since had the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/30/2021 with no immediate adverse reaction, just side effects (chills, severe headache, fatigue, sore arm).

                                                Vaccine induced pancytopenia /  thrombocytopenia - STILL ONGOING WITH TREATMENT.  My mom felt very tired the 2nd day after the vaccine; blood taken ~5 days after vaccination showed lower HgB count (8.8 from her normal range of 11&#43;). She remained at home for recovery and then consulted a hematologist. During this period she still felt extremely tired / dizzy / headaches / couldn&#39;t walk up the stairs without breath. 13 days later - more blood sample was taken and now she is diagnosed with pancytopenia - lowered count of RBC (it down further), HgB (down further to 7.1), and Platelets (down to 80 from ~170 her first blood sample). And she was hospitalized. They gave her Prednisone, and a blood transfusion at the hospital. During this first stay - her RBC / HgB and Platelets seemed to have stablized and went higher but they didn&#39;t pay attention to her WBC - which went down to 2 (below normal range). A day later during follow up around WBC - it went lower to ~1.2 (her platelets ~117). She developed a fever - now it is considered a neutropenic fever and she was hospitalized once again (platelets was back down to 84 at the beginning of her stay). During this past week in the hospital, they gave her meds to induce WBC growth - which worked but it overshot to 12 (above normal range) and at the same time her platelets and RBC and HgB dipped again lower. Platelets dipped to 43 on Saturday along with HgB down to  7.1 after 2 days of sustained high WBC count so they gave her IVIG and another blood transfusion. After that, her WBC dropped a little further and is stabilizing around 6 along with HgB around ~10. However her platelets remain high volatile - it went to 51 on Sunday, dropped to 46 on Monday, and now it is 38 today. She was discharged from the hospital today and we have a standing order to have her blood tested everyday.

My symptoms got worse one the next week and a half. I went to an emergency room on 3/28/21 and was admitted to an ICU with a Saddle Embolus of Pulmonary Artery with Acute Cor Pulmonale. Many blood clots in my lungs and one very large one in the artery between my heart and lungs. I am now on Blood Thinners.

Just before 11am we received a call from the patient&#39;s roommate that the patient arrived home and collapsed, it was also mentioned her blood pressure was high. We explained that they needed to call 911 but the patient did not want to go to the hospital. We explained that this patient must go to the hospital and get evaluated. They did end up calling 911.  Approximately 45 minutes later I received another call from the patient&#39;s roommate that EMS did not believe this was a reaction from the vaccine. The roommate mentioned that she was in fact mistaken about the blood pressure and it was actually low (92/54 mmHg). She also mentioned that the patient was vomiting.   Around 1:45pm I received a call from the roommate to tell me that the patient had died.

I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

VAERS notification being made due to pt death within 24 hours of receiving a vaccine.

Went to pharmacist who had me sit down, within 30 seconds could not swallow. Pharmacist injected me with Epi Pen and called 911. Paramedics arrived gave more epinephrine, oxygen, started breathing treatment. Lost my voice as throat started to tighten more. Taken to Hospital where I was given Benadryl, steroids, stomach meds, more fluids and another breathing treatment since my lungs were so tight, I could only take shallow breaths. The crated my lungs, did blood work and kept me overnight for observation because I have a history of secondary reactions when I experience anaphylaxis. I was released from the hospital on 2/20/2021 at 2pm.

I fainted and cut my forehead in the fall.  I was shaking uncontrollably following this.  My husband bandaged my forehead and checked me for a concussion.  Sometime after 2am I realized I was in atrial fibrillation.  I have a Kardia app that confirmed this.  I tried at home methods to go back in rhythm.  At 8am I called my cardiologist.  He advised me to go to the emergency room.  At this time the Kardia app indicated I was no longer in Afib but still had a fast heartbeat.  At the emergency room I had a normal EKG, CAT scan, blood work and chest X-ray and went home about 11am.

She even looked like she was gasping for air. An epipen was administered and within seconds she was able to breathe. 911 was contacted upon initiation of the reaction. EMS arrived within minutes after administering the epipen. She was assessed by paramedics and it was determined that the patient would be ok. I called husband in the afternoon to check on patient and he stated that she was good. I also followed up on 03/05/2021 with the patient and she stated that other than soreness that she was fine. I let patient know that since she had a reaction to the first dose, that she would not be able to receive the second dose.

The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 004M20A) on 07 Feb 2021.   On 07 Mar 2021, approximately 2 days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 029A21A) via an unknown route in the left non dominant arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 08 Mar 2021, patient experienced sweating, patient felt funny, fainted and was unconscious for few minutes and patient felt very weak.   No treatment was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 59-year-old female who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness along with nonserious events of unexpected asthenia, inappropriate affect and hyperhidrosis.  Event onset occurred on Day 2 after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment not reported. Event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.
