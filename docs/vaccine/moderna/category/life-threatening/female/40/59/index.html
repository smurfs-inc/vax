                                                Patient received Moderna Covid vaccine on Friday evening 1/8/21.  She awoke Saturday am around 2AM with a severe headache.  She also developed a fever during the day.  She did not seek treatment until Sunday and went to Hospital ED.  She was treated and released same day.  She went back to hospital on Monday as she felt worse and she was admitted at that time and treated for a bloodstream infection and meningitis.  We are not sure it was caused by the vaccine.  She consulted her PCP and her PCP feels it may be more coincidental given her medical HX.

                                                On January 4 at 2:00 pm I suddenly started to bleed from the nose from the left nostril and then from both. The event lasted more than 35 minutes so I had to go to the ER. The diagnosis was Epistaxis. I was discharged because at the time of the medical evaluation I removed a large clot from my mouth and the bleeding stopped.  Appointment with primary physician for diagnosis and appointment with ENT was ordered. On January 5 at 4:15 am I had another episode of nasal bleeding lasting 25 min. After removing a clot through the mouth, the bleeding stopped. At 4:00 pm I presented Epistaxis again so I had to return to the Emergency Room. I was reevaluated and the instruction was to visit the ENT and Afrin prescription for three days and Claritin D q 12 hrs PRN. From January 6 to 9, I began to eliminate a serous-bloody vaginal discharge. That began with the elimination of a clot and progressively diminished day by day.  January 11, 2021, the ENT evaluated me and indicated that it did not observe polyps or anatomical problems. I had not previously prolonged nosebleeds. Previously two minor episodes happened to me, a year ago that resolved in less than 7 minutes. I didn&#39;t have a cold or any other symptoms.  I want to raise the flag because it was a strange event that occurred after the vaccination and that I had not experienced before in that way.My next dose is January 29, 2021. I am awaiting clot test results

No other symptoms.  For 2nd vaccine, the vaccine itself was extremely painful (burned and pain at site and tingled down to fingertips for a few hours. Applied pressure as I bled for 10 min after administration. Followed by ice off and on for 20 min for first 2 hours.  At 22 hours, I started to feel nauseated and lightheaded and had mental fogginess. The following morning, I awoke around 3am and was very ill with flu like symptoms. mild temperature of 99.8, chills, body aches, fatigue, rapid pulse, headache, sore throat, and mental fogginess. This lasted for approx. 36 hours. The worse symptoms were the headache, fatigue, and severe body aches that lasted for 72 hours after vaccine.

I went over to evaluate and pt told me she felt fine and she would take a Benadryl when she got to the car. I assisted her to the back where we further evaluate her. She had clear signs of anaphylaxis (blood shot eyes, hives, swollen tongue, rapid heart beat) but did not want EPI. I advised her that EPI is NEEDED quickly and that Benadryl was not enough. She then agreed to let me EPI her. Epi was administer in the left thigh at 10;18. A set of vitals were then taken and patient was places on o2. The emergency department was called at 10;20 and arrived at  10;25. During this time another set of vitals were taken. Patient expressed feeling better but jittery.  Hives and tongue swelling had significant improvement but patient still had some symptoms so we advised the follow up team of our recommendation for second dose epi. Emergency team took control of patient.

                                                She got her vaccine, within 10 minutes her heart felt like it was racing.  She noticed over the next 2 days that she was unable to move with nausea and body aches from head to toe and had to lie in bed those days.  She had been exercising regularly and now she had fatigue and had to stop exercising as her heart was acting strange and not able to do so.  On 5/21/21 her heart was beating so fast and went to UC and they tested her blood work.  She said that she had left chest pain, pain down her beds, and pain down her arms.  They did blood work stated that she had very high troponin levels, and her BP was dropping to low levels and they called 9-1-1 and she was taken to another hospital and they did the same tests and found that her troponin levels were even higher, and that her heart was experiencing some kind of arrest.  Her BP was dropping and she was admitted to the ICU where she was there 4 days.  While she was there they did angiograms, echocardiograms, and every one came back stating that her heart was good.  They told her that she may have had a mild heart attack and they did not know why and she said that she felt it was due to thev accine.  on 5/24/21 she was discharged and on 5/25/21 she called 9-1-1 again and her BP was high and her heart rate was high, and she was taken to the ER again.  She was tested again and they did not see anything, and they felt that she had myocarditis or pericarditis and that she needed an MRI of the heart and to contact her cardiologist and her PCP.  She came home that night and went to the ER again the next day and felt that she was heaving a heart attack, arm pain, heart racing, and did the same things again and told them what tests she was supposed to have, and they have not done an MRI of her heart yet.  She is waiting to get a referral from her PCP for the cardiac MRI and she is experiencing the same reactions that she has been having.   They have put her on a baby aspirin to take daily, Lopressor 25 mg twice a day,  Lipitor 40 mg to take once a day,   She continues to have the bouts of the chest pain, erratic heart beat, weakness and not able to take a shower due to the weakness and the heart racing and the shortness of breath.    They were telling her during this time that parts of her heart were dying, and all kinds of other things, and that&#39;s when they put her in the ICU.  She went to UC, and was transferred to ER and admitted to the ICU and stayed 4 days.  She was discharged from there on 5/24/21.  Then back to the ER on 5/25/21, and discharged from the ER.  Then she went back again last night 5/27/21 to ER and they treated her partially, they did an EKG and tried to explain her situation and they told her that she was fine, and she told them that her troponin levels were high and he more or less dismissed her and said that his troponin levels would be high if he exercises excessively.  She left the ER as they were not going to do anything for her.    She has a phone appointment scheduled for Tuesday as they have nothing until later in June.

                                                Anaphylaxis.  Initially, pt experienced palpitations and tightness in throat after vaccination  and wasn&#39;t sure if she was experiencing swelling in her arms.  BP was 130/79 and HR 93 initially.  Pt started to feel better without intervention but given diphenhydramine as a precaution while we continued to monitor her.  10 mins later she started to have tingling in lips and tongue and visible lip swelling  in addition to palpitations.   Immediately administered Epipen (0.3mg) x 1.  EMS was called.  No worsening but not improvement after 5 mins so a second dose of Epipen (0.3mg) was administered.  By the time EMS arrived (9 mins after first epipen dose) pt was feeling better, swelling had resolved, no throat tightness.  Pt was transported to local hospital by EMS for monitoring.

Petechiae and bruising started about 36-72 hours after vaccine. Platelet count on day of vaccine was 175K, and was 56K four days later. I have immune thrombocytopenia that was stable with counts around 175K regularly prior to  COVID-19 vaccination. My counts have been unstable and trending lower since vaccination.

                                                I developed a sudden, sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my head while at work. I had not fallen nor had any injuries/illness. I went to ER; CT scan was concerning for clot in sinus so I was sent via ambulance to inpatient neurology where further MRI/MRV scans determined it was not in fact a clot, but a small bleed of unknown origin. Again, I had no injuries. I was hospitalized while multiple scans were completed along with lab work. Home now following up with neurology, still have head pain, unable to fully work, etc. Hematoma is still there but not growing.

                                                I was about 6.5 weeks pregnant and experienced medium to heavy bleeding.  I went to the emergency room, and they indicated that the fetus was fine.  The next day I would bleed if I was moving around so I stayed in bed for two days.  I have had three miscarriages prior to this pregnancy, but i did not have this bleeding in any of them? they seem to have been due to a septum which has now been removed.

Per EMS report, the patient was found in an apartment complex by a neighbor unconscious.  The initial report was that she was breathing however EMS was called back and then told that she was not breathing and not responsive.  Estimated downtime was between 5 and 8 minutes before paramedics arrived and initiated CPR.  Due to the patient&#39;s body habitus, it did take approximately 15 minutes to get the patient transported to the hospital.  3 rounds of epinephrine were given in the field.  Her rhythm has been asystole prior to getting to the emergency department.  Intraosseous access is obtained.  There is an OPA in place.

                                                On about 12 May, I began experiencing pain in my left calf, as if I had a pulled muscle. Since I saw no redness, swelling, nor noticed any warmth to the area, I thought I had just pulled the muscle. After 3-4 days, the pain began dissipating, but then I started having shortness of breath. On 19 May, the shortness of breath became extreme and I went to the ER where I was diagnosed with numerous pulmonary embolisms in all lobes of both lungs and also DVTs in my left calf, as well as slight enlargment of the right ventricle of my heart. I was hospitalized until 24 May. During my hospitalization, I was on a heparin IV, as well as had a catheter in my neck to administer TPA to my lungs for 24 hours. I also had a filter placed in my inferior vena cava. I was discharged on 24 May with a prescription for Xarelto and follow-ups scheduled with my family doctor and cardiologist.

Then on 4/21, I experienced High Fever (103.8), Body aches, headache, extreme fatigue that lasted through Monday 4/26. Through that time I went and got a Covid test on Friday 4/23 and it came back negative. On Thursday 4/29, I started having pain on the right upper side of my abdomen. Friday evening, the pain grew even more intense which I could not lay down to sleep and no pain meds were taking it away. Saturday, 4/30 at 6 am ended up in ER at Facility. They were testing me for blood clots due to the chest pain and sever right side pain and the results showed no blood clots and my heart was fine. CT scan showed pneumonia, scarring in my lungs and a nodule growth on my lung. The doctor asked me if I was in the dessert recently if I had ever had valley fever. Valley Fever came back negative, another Covid 19 test came back negative. I completed taking 2 antibiotics and now on 5/25 (day 40) I am still feeling bouts of fatigue, wheezing in my lung and pain in my lung. I was healthy prior to getting the 2nd dose of Moderna and can&#39;t help but feel the vaccine triggered something in my system. Reporting this just in case it is an adverse effect from the vaccine.

Some of the symptoms experienced included chest tightness, difficulty breathing, throat swelling, and weakness. The patient was transported to the hospital by the emergency medical services (EMS). Treatment for the event included epinephrine several times.   On 01 Jan 2021, the patient experienced extreme fatigue, tightness in sternum, and weakness at home. She returned to the hospital where she was admitted. It was noted that a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed atelectasis. The patient also experienced extreme bilateral leg weakness and difficulty walking. The patient was advised to be placed in a nursing home/rehabilitation center.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome for the events, anaphylactic shock, extreme fatigue, tightness in sternum, atelectasis, extreme bilateral leg weakness, and difficulty walking, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 42- year old, female patient with medical history of allergy to shellfish, bee sting and mushrooms, who experienced a serious, unexpected event of anaphylactic shock, chest discomfort, muscular weakness, gait disturbance, fatigue, and atelectasis. The event of anaphylactic shock occurred 5 minutes after first dose of the mRNA-1273. The event of chest discomfort, muscular weakness, gait disturbance, fatigue, and atelectasis occurred 2 days after first dose of the mRNA-1273. The treatment included epinephrine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded..

                                                Adverse event: I had anaphylaxis on 2/12/21 that required transport via ambulance to the nearest emergency room for life saving treatment.  Background information. I took a 7 day course of celebrex (200mg orally once daily) on 1/25/21, prescribed by my primary physician for a flare up of low back pain.  A 14 day course was prescribed; I stopped taking it after 7 days because my stomach was getting upset and I didn&#39;t want to take it close to my 2nd covid moderna booster. I got my 2nd moderna covid vaccine booster on 2/8/21.  For 1-2 days, my left arm (injection site) was sore and I was mildly fatigued.   I took over the counter advil  (200mg twice daily) and tylenol (500mg twice daily); the day I took advil, I was sneezing and developed signs of allergic rhinitis (congestion/runny eyes and nose). I did not have any other immediate adverse reaction and by Thursday, 2/11, the arm soreness and fatigue resolved.   My low back pain began to bother me again, so I took a 200mg oral dose of celebrex at 7:30a on 2/12/21. I went to work (I am a veterinary neurologist. While at work, at 9:30a on 2/12/21, I had a severe anaphylactic reaction and had to be taken via ambulance to Medical Center.  I developed hives/welts/burning/itching all over my body,  within 5 minutes my throat closed up, I couldn&#39;t breathe, I became hypotensive/collapsed; in the ambulance, I was given IM epinephrine; then at the ER, I was given IV steroids (solumedrol), benedryl, famotidine, zofran (due to abdominal pain/nausea) and IV fluids. This stabilized my signs within 1 hour and I improved and was going to be discharged at 2pm. However,  the hives returned at that time, so I was given additional IV benedryl, famotidine, fluids and oral prednisone and kept in the hospital overnight for monitoring; I was discharged to go home on 2/13/21 on a 4 day course of oral famotidine, benedryl and prednisone; I remained itchy and continued sneezing at home on 2/13/21. Today, 2/14/21, all signs of this reaction have resolved.    The ER doctors and myself believe the 2nd moderna covid booster on 2/8/21 stimulated my innate immune system, leading to this anaphylactic reaction to celebrex (a medication I had taken 2 weeks prior with no problem).   The doctors feel the celebrex is what set off the anaphylactic shock, but that my immune system was primed to do so after the vaccine.  In hindsight, I realized that I was having allergic rhinitis symptoms after taking oral advil on 2/9 the day after my booster (which has never happened to me before either). I am a person with no pre-existing allergies of any kind. There was nothing different at all in my routine including food or potential environmental exposures) on 2/12, the day of my anaphylactic reaction, other than my taking a 200mg dose of oral celebrex.  I am not allowed to take NSAIDs until I see an allergist for testing now.   I am reporting this adverse event as I believe the moderna booster caused an anaphylaxis to the celebrex medication.

The pain and difficulty breathing lasted several days. Since then, I have experience a flare of the antiphospholipid syndrome - low platelets (blood work), splinter hemorrhages, clots, and the like. Whether from the embolism or other, the pulmonary hypertension has gotten drastically worse - with increased shortness of breath, irregular heart beats, dropping pulse ox.

The cramps became worse and I started spotting. I took two ibuprofen but they provided no relief. I became nauseas and had a headache as well. I felt better the next day except my arm aches and mild stomach cramps. The cramps have continued still.

                                                1 day after shot I had flu symptoms and was basically out of the whole day.  2 days after  my fever cleared and I noticed a pain in my left leg calf.  I thought it was because of my shot but that it was just body aches.  The pain increased and eventually spread to my inside thigh. I went to the urgent care on 5/17/21 and an ultrasound discovered blood clots (Deep Vein Thrombosis)  Please note that I also had traveled 5 hours on a flight on 5/6/21 but I was stretching on the flight and have never had a DVT before.

                                                During the 15 minute observation following the 1st Moderna vaccine dose, the patient reported her tongue &#39;felt thick,&#39; flushed skin, redness on face, neck, hands, BP=98/60, HR=100.  Patient felt &#39;jittery&#39; and &#39;heart racing.&#39;  Was transferred to ED for evaluation given that patient reported her tongue &#39;getting tighter.&#39;  In the ED, the patient was treated with diphenhydramine 25mg x 2 doses, methylprednisolone 125mg x 1 dose, famotidine 20mg x 1 dose, and NS IV fluids.  Hypoglycemia was ruled out with CBG=87.  The physician avoided treatment with epinephrine due to it being listed on her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;shortness of breath.&#39;  Symptoms resolved over the next 3 hours.  The patient was discharged home with a new prescription of oral prednisone taper.  Subsequent follow-up with her primary care provider, in consultation with an ID provider, recommended that this patient NOT get a 2nd dose.  Covid-19 vaccine was added to her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;anaphylaxis.&#39;

                                                I got a little dizzy while walking to my seat. I got a rush of adrenaline and my heart rate shot up. I went and sat with the paramedics and they took my BP, but it wasn&#39;t considered abnormal. They walked me outside and I felt better. I had some splotches under my throat, but that happens sometimes when I get upset. There was no swelling or anything and it resolved within 25 minutes. That night, I had a 101 temp, was really cold and just generally felt crummy. The following Thursday, I was using ammonia and couldn&#39;t smell it. My son complained of being cold that night, which isn&#39;t normal for him. We got tested the next day and we both were positive for COVID. I had an exposure on Jan 12, but didn&#39;t find out until I called my boss and she told my coworker had it. I was sick for another 10 days, but was never hospitalized. I had a Chest x-ray done on 1/31 and I had developed pneumonia.  I got my 2nd dose on Feb 19th. I experienced basic symptoms along with residual tightening in the chest and fogginess, but I think that was because I had just had COVID. About 36 hours later, I was back to normal.

                                                Have had tiredness since 2nd vaccine in February and noticed shortness of breath when walking or going up stairs in mid March.  Around 4/1, I started having left rib pain preventing me from sleeping on my left side and then could not breath during a massage on 4/8.   On April 9th, I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms (clots) in both lungs, reducing my lung capacity to only 30% of normal.  This could be due to Loestrin birth control but I have taken hormones in the past for IVF and when younger for birth control.  The reaction may be due to a combination of vaccine, Loestrin and iron but triggered by vaccine.  I am currently on Eliquis to treat pulmonary embolisms.

                                                3/2 - Received the first round of Moderna vaccination. No immediate side-effects noted.  I talked with my physician prior to getting the vaccine due to medical conditions and medications that I am taking. I was taking Xarelto due to chronic DVT/Blood clots in my left leg.   After 2.5 weeks I noted my left leg was swelling and I started to have discomfort in my leg. No noticeable changes to my leg at this time that made me concerned about getting the second vaccine.   3/30 - I received my second vaccination in the morning. I ended up going into the hospital at 4 pm due to numbness and pain in my left leg. I ended up being admitted to the hospital due to a DVT behind my L knee and in my femoral/iliac veins. I was also diagnosed with May-Thurbers syndrome. All the physicians, hematologists, and surgeons were surprised that I ended up with a severe blood clot as I was on Xarelto for over two years without an incident or problem. I did not have a fall or any change in my life that would have caused this issue to happen and they were all stumped.  I was switched to a heparin drip while Xarelto was clearing out of my system and in two days I had two stints put in my femoral/iliac vein on my left leg.  I was changed over to Lovenox and Coumadin 5-7.5 mg before leaving the hospital. There were no concerns and I was in the hospital from 3/30 to 4/3/21.  After I was discharged from the hospital I went to my primary care follow up on Tuesday 4/6/21. I was having increased pain behind my knee and overall not feeling well. I ended up having more labs completed and another ultrasound to indicate I had a small DVT behind my knee from my procedure.   On Friday 4/9/21 I went in for my INR and found my coumadin was within therapeutic range. When I got home I changed into comfy clothing and noted that I had a red/purplish rash looking dots/bumps from my toes to my knees on both LE, my Left was more significant than my right. I went back into the doctor and I was prescribed a topical steroid to help decrease the edema, pain and redness.   Saturday 4/10/21 - my legs became painful to the touch, they felt like they were going to burst due to pressure, and the rash/reddness was looking worse and spreading. I was sent back to the ER and was admitted back to the hospital. They diagnosed me with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, removed me off of coumadin, and started me on Arixtra. The hematologist, physicians and staff did not know what to do and I was now deemed medically complex and had to be monitored for a few days and gave me prednisone. Once removed from coumadin the rash/pain/swelling subsided and started to diminish. I was discharged from the hospital.  I returned to work on Tuesday 4/13 and after returning home I had increased pain, pressure and rash that now was visible from my knees to my hips and this was not present in the hospital. My physician is asking for a biopsy and increased my prednisone to stay at 20 mg a day.  At night I have to elevate my legs or they become swollen and will become painful.   4/16/21 I wore compression tights per physician guidelines and when I came home from work I had new spots and rashes on my feet, they were swollen and had increased pain. My left ankle had a rash on it as well. After elevation and a nights rest the rash started to diminish and the rest of my legs have started to diminish or disappear.

Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccination I began passing large clots and my flow went from regular to heavy. I do have heavy cycles from time to time but found the abrupt change in cycle interesting. Other than being sore in the arm and tired I feel fine.

                                                On April 16th I was weight training when my R arm became suddenly painful and heavy feeling.  A few hours later I noticed my arm had gotten very swollen and blue.  I went to urgent care and was sent for an US.  It showed a large clot in my internal jugular vein as well as clots in my R subclavian, axillary, brachial, proximal cephalic, and proximal basilic veins.  They sent me to ER and did a CT and also found a small PE in my L lower lobe pulmonary artery.  Currently I am on enoxaparin and very limited in use of my R arm.  The cause of my clots remains unknown.  I am waiting on blood tests to see if I have any genetic factors.  It seems unlikely that this is tied to the vaccination but I wanted to report in case there end up being similar cases.

                                                4/7/21 around 630pm began to feel ill and had sore arm. By about 1030pm, had significant body aches, headache, clammy skin, vomiting, diarrhea, near passing out, fast heart beat, with fever. These symptoms lasted about 48 hours. The next 48 hours just had ill feeling with extreme fatigue. Come 4/12/21, I had nausea, headache, fever of about 100.4 and body aches. By 4/14/21, I ended up going to the ER for shortness of breath, chest tightness, extreme fatigue and voice hoarseness. Those doctors performed several labs to include Chest CT which showed elevated D-Dimer levels. An EKG was performed which was baseline. Ultrasound of my veins was performed. They also did a COVID test which was negative. They sent me home and told me to rest and drink lots of fluid. On 4/16/21, I had a video call with my doctor who didn&#39;t like the sound of my voice and straining to catch my breath and I was sent to urgent care/ER. They admitted me as an ER visit due to my continued shortness of breath, cough, sore throat, night sweats, dizziness, chest tightness along with my voice being hoarse. Another COVID test was performed and was negative. During their exam, my oxygen levels were dropping into the low 80s and my heart rate was in the 120s and 130s. Their CT scan was down so they sent me to another ER where another CT scan was performed. Another COVID test was performed and was negative.  My D-Dimer was elevated, liver enzymes was slightly elevated and again my oxygen levels were lower than would like to see and elevated heart rate. I ended up being admitted into the hospital for an overnight stay to monitor my symptoms. They treated me for suspected blood clot, shortness of breath, chest tightness. I was given 2 shots of heparin in the stomach, IV fluids, multiple vitamins in attempt to boost my immune system, along with ADVAIR and Albuteral. My discharge diagnose from the hosptial was Acute Bronchitis, Anxiety disorder, Recent Moderna 2nd dose COVID vaccine with significant side effects in the form of fever, generalized weakness and dizziness.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 20 Jan 2021 at 18:00, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection, the patient began to have tongue swelling. She was given diphenhydramine and epinephrine by epi pen. She went to the emergency room where she displayed symptoms including a fast heart rate, wheezing, and shortness of breath with an angioedema or anaphylaxis like appearance. She was given more epinephrine, famotidine, scheduled diphenhydramine at 50 QAs intravenously (IV), IV steroids, was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She was on the ventilator for approximately 18-20 hours following admission. She eventually responded to a high dose of dexamethasone. She was also given duonebs for her shortness of breath, regular sedation for the ventilator, and a dose of ketorolac. Consent was given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events were unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred approximately 10 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration. She was treated with epinephrine, famotidine, diphenhydramine, IV steroids, intubated and placed on a ventilator.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

Started bleeding vaginal today in the midst of the adverse symptoms. I got scared. Called my dr no literature about bleeding . Just one study of  women reported menstrual bleeding after shot.  Is this a side affect and will this affects me long term

She commented, &#34; You are really a bleeder&#34;. I&#39;m not actually. My arm was instantly sore. I bruise developed within a day and lasted about 3 weeks. I have had constant arm pain since. Unable to have full range of motion, sleep on the left side, and OTC medication does not stop the constant pain.

Five minutes after injection on 3/31/2021, c/o chest tightness followed by nausea and heaving.  Treated for anaphylaxis, transferred by ambulance to Medical Center; and discharged to home later that afternoon.  The employee worked her regular schedule 4/2/21 and 4/5/21 with no stated complaints.  On 4/6/21, received notification from the Employee that she was to be off work through 4/12/21 as her physician feels that the vaccine has damaged her heart.  She states she has a heart rate down to 38 BPM, experiences black outs, has left sided head pain and weakness.  Her personal physician is scheduling her for Holter Monitor and Echocardiogram.  Her physician has now stated she cannot work through 4/16/21.  I have no supporting written documentation from the physician for these medical concerns.

By morning, it went away.  7 days later it came back and was consistent.  I went to the ER after 5 days of consistently having a dull ache in my chest.  On March 12th, I had a CT scan of  my chest and the result was as follows: Pulmonary Embolism: a filling defect along a branch point of a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery with decreased opacification of the distal subsegmental pulmonary arteries at this location.

(I assume the groin pain was cause by a blood clot in her upper leg that moved up into her lungs.)

No history of anaphylactic response to vaccines BUT I do have a history with bee stings, sulfa drugs, and the the initial allergy shot from a new, stronger vial. Symptoms remained moderate - I didn?t treat with my epi pen, and eventually took Benadryl and was ok.

                                                with this 1st of 2 shots I began getting a headache that began within 1 hour after the shot.  The headache immediately became intense and stayed.  Advil did not do anything for it.  That same evening I began having intense abdominal pain on my right side, it became so bad I was scared my appendix was going to burst.  I had my son on standby to take me to the hospital.  It was so severe I could not stand.  The only way that I can describe the pain would be: after natural birth and you begin nursing, the insanely intense contractions of the uterus to shed the afterbirth is how intense the pain was. I then started my menstrual cycle but was not supposed to for another week and 1/2.  The pain stayed, but did dull some, it wasn&#39;t as sharp but still intense.  My flow was extraordinarily heavy and I lost count of how many huge blood clots I passed.  Some clots were the size of my palm.  This cycle lasted a full 7 days.   My normal cycle starts with a little spotting, then 1 or 2 days of medium flow, then a couple days of spotting.  I also do not have my cycle every 30 days, more like 38-40.  I figure its pre-menopause.

                                                Patient asked how to report a missed abortion (miscarriage) after the second dose of the Moderna vaccine since she was told by doctors to report it.  Patient had a positive pregnancy test on 3/14/21 after receiving the second dose of Moderna on 3/11/21 but did not know prior to receiving the second dose.   Patient stated that it was determined she was 6 weeks pregnant 6 days after the second shot. On 4/1/2021 patient had abdominal pain and bleeding so went to the emergency room and an ultrasound was performed.  It was determined that the missed abortion occurred when the baby was at 6 weeks.  After several doctor visits, the patient was advised to report this and that is why this was brought to our attention.  She simply asked how to report this and then I asked her some questions and gathered information.  She was okay and sounded fine.

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on 1/1/21.  Initially, I had a sore arm for 24 hours but otherwise no problems.  Then, on day 8, my left deltoid area started itching and there was a red, slightly raised area just larger than a golf ball. I called the  hotline at that time and took a Benadryl.  Then, 24 hrs later, the area had expanded to over 3 times the size and felt warm. I actually went and saw a friend who lived in my neighborhood who is a general surgeon and he thought I should get it checked out to make sure it wasn&#39;t an NSTI.  Being Saturday at 9pm, I went to the ER  where they started me on Keflex/Bactrim for a presumed cellulitis.  By the next morning, the redness and itching were gone and my arm felt totally back to normal the next day after that. Unfortunately, on day 3 of the antibiotics (Tuesday the 12th), I had symptoms of anaphylaxis (chest tightness, wheezing, throat clearing, lip swelling, hoarse voice, impending doom sensation).  I took Benadryl 50mg and got my epi pen ready but did not use it.  (I have a tree nut allergy).  The symptoms resolved completely about 1 hour later.

                                                Nurse did hit a capillary and I bled immediately after injection- enough where it ran down my arm and went onto floor. I felt pretty okay except for the feeling of my arm hot and fuzzy and fuzzy fingers on my left hand until my &#34;leave time&#39; of 10:03 am. I stayed a little longer, and was home by 10:30 when I became extremely nauseous, dry heaving, left side of face numb. Headache started at 10:40. Tried calling medical facility but was on hold for soo long- no one answered so since I don&#39;t have insurance I decided to just rest and drink fluids. By 11:40 my face was back to normal, no longer nauseous but extremely lethargic and was the rest of the day. The following day I felt ok -slight swelling on my arm at injection site and a bruise that I still have.

                                                The evening (3/20/21)I received the vaccine I noticed fatigue, headache and chills. The next morning I developed shortness of breath. The day after that my left left began swelling for no reason, was slightly discolored and warm to the touch. As the week went on my shortness of breath became greater and my leg more swollen. On (3/26/21) I sent to the ER by my doctor. Had a ultra sound and discovered an extensive DVT in my left groin down to behind left knee. Had a CT and discovered blood clots in my lungs. I had never had any underlying health conditions or been on medications, don&#39;t smoke, no complaints prior. Was transported to hospital spent 2.5 days in ICU before being moved to a regular bed for a total of (4) days hospitalized. The doctor installed two sheaths on each side of groin, injected my lungs with medication to blast/dissolve the clots and installed a filter in the main artery to catch any clots that may break away from leg. I was also put on a Heparin drip while in ICU. The next day the doctor went and the procedure was a success dissolving the clots. He removed the sheaths. I went back to ICU. The next day (3/28/21) a second utlra sound was done to left leg and DVT is still in left leg. Have been described Eliquis blood thinner.

                                                My last period prior to my first vaccine shot had been in June 2020.  All signs, including blood work, pointed to me having entered menopause.  My mom also went through menopause at age 45 when her periods suddenly stopped, so I figured I was following in her footsteps.  On Saturday, February 13, 2021, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, and by Thursday morning, I was spotting.  This was very surprising since I had not had a period in several months.  Over the course of a couple of days, it turned into a full-blown period with the most severe cramping I&#39;ve ever had in my life.  By Saturday, they felt like labor contractions, and I was releasing sizable blood clots.  I made an appointment at our health clinic, and all bloodwork again pointed to menopause.  After my 2nd Moderna vaccine, I again experienced just a tiny bit of brown spotting a few days after the vaccine.  However, it did not progress into a full-blown period that time.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving injection in right arm I felt a BOOM flush all over my body like I just had an IV Contrast.  Then I became dizzy, my heart started racing, I started cold sweats and felt tightness in my mid upper chest to the base of my throat.  The ED RN on site took my BP and HR and had me lie down because I felt that I couldn&#39;t breath.  She called paramedics who took my BP and HR, then did a 12 lead EKG.  They transported me to the ED.  I was worked up for cardiac, lung, chemistry.  My troponin-HS was slightly elevated and a cardiologist was called.  He did an echo on my heart, liver and right kidney -- normal.  Chest X-ray was normal.  A second 12 lead EKG was done, normal sinus.  Hematology, Chemistry was normal.  Was in the ED from 11:30 to 4:00 p.m.  Advised by ED Doctor, and Cardiologist, that it seems the stress of the anaphylaxis reaction stressed the heart which caused the spill of troponin.  Advised to see my cardiologist and get a stress test.  I have already informed my Primary Care Doctor and he has prescribed me an EPI-PEN to carry.  I have no history of allergic reactions/anaphylaxis reactions to vaccines.  I am up to date with all other vaccines and just had my yearly flu shot in November 2020.  This was my first allergic reaction/anaphylaxis reaction to a vaccine.

                                                Patient&#39;s received 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine Friday 3/12.  Her husband reported she had not unexpected fatigue,  malaise, and fever for 1 day but better after that.  On Monday she began complaining of shortness of breath.  This progressively worsened and she started having presyncopal episodes.  On Saturday she was unable to come down the stairs in the house so husband planned to take her to the hospital but she stood up and passed out and woke up quickly.  He decided to call EMS.  By the time she presented to our hospital she was cyanotic and agonal breathing.  On moving her from EMS stretcher to ED bed she had PEA cardiac arrest.  She underwent mechanical device CPR with only brief (&lt;1 min) ROSC x1.  She at some point did have a shockable rhythm.  Cath lab was notified and she was taken emergently to the cath lab with ongoing mechanical device CPR.  Peripheral VA ECMO was placed after about 1.5 hours.  Pulmonary angiogram was done which showed massive saddle PE with near complete obliteration of the right pulmonary tree and some filling defects in the left tree as well.  At that time she had severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 24.  She also had no gag or corneal reflex, minimally responsive pupils, and no response to noxious stimuli.  Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted with some result.  She was transferred to the SICU with increasing pressor requirement, and DIC.  Ultimately, the venous catheter of the ECMO circuit malfunctioned thought to be secondary propagating IVC thrombosis.  Family decided to withdraw care and she passed away.

On  3/6/2021 at 11:24 AM I presented  with dizziness, slurred speech, a feeling of my lip dropping to the right, and weakness in left upper extremity.  Called my daughter whom arrived within 10 minutes. After asking me some questions and exercises she  said my strength in the left upper extremity was weak compared to the right.  My daughter took me to ER, at check in I said I think I had a stroke. I was admitted, and neurology was consulted. In the ER they called it a TIA, and after imaging a  diagnosis of stroke was made.    Acute frontoparietal infarct, ASA/plavix, lipitor, PT/OT, Neurologist follow up.    After discharge I have been meeting with PT/OT following exercises. Met with my PCP and continued medications Aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg. Still have muscle aches, and pain in the left upper extremity- especially 3rd and 5th digits.

The patient denied having any allergies, past medical history or concomitant medications.  Therefore, no medical history or concomitant medications were reported.  On 14-Jan-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #: 251L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10-Feb-2021, approximately twenty-four days prior to the onset of events, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #: 16M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Mar-2021 the patient had a &#34;TIA&#34; (transient ischemic attack). She was sitting down and when she got up, she got dizzy and her left arm was paralyzed. The right side of her face was drooping, she had slurred speech and she was confused. The patient went to the hospital where she was hospitalized for 2 days. The MD (medical doctor) said she had a &#34;7 mm focal diffusion.&#34;  Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event(s); therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event(s) is not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, TIA, dizzy, her left arm was paralyzed, right side of her face was drooping, slurred speech, and she was confused, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient a 46 yo female with a history of Bechet&#39;s presenting to the ED yesterday due to a history of progressive bruising with later appearance of petechiae and gum bleeding.   CBC yesterday revealed an isolated thrombocytopenia with platelets of 19k (&gt;340k all previous checks), suspected ITP.  She was given 1 unit of platelets, solumedrol x 1 and IVIG.  Platelets this morning have responded but more likely related to the platelet transfusion.    Today I discussed continuation of IVIG and transitioning over to pulse dexamethasone 40 mg x 4 days q 14 days for 4 cycles in order to put the ITP in remission.   Considerations for precipitating event leading to the ITP include autoimmune condition recently undergoing dose adjustment, history of recent infection (viral gastroenteritis), and post Covid 19 vaccination induced ITP-currently described incidence between 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 and seen between 1-3 wks after vaccination.     This is unlikely to be related to vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) as there is no sign of clotting.  In addition she received an mRNA vaccine (Moderna) which has not been reported to cause VITT. A HIT antibody was sent.

I started to feel cramping as if I was  getting ready to start my cycle on Sunday. They lasted almost two weeks every day and some days I needed to take Ibprofen because they were strong. I also had very sore and tender breasts and became bloated like I was going to start my cycle. I finished my cycle two days prior to getting the shot, so these symptoms are not normal at this time. I still have some cramping and off and on bloating. My breasts hurt off and on. I have started slightly spotting. I should not have my cycle until the end of the month. I told my doctor about these symptoms and she said they sound related and to report this.

I had a uterine ablation in 2018 and have not had a period at all until 2 days after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna. It was not a regular period. I bled heavily for a couple of weeks, then lightly for a week or so, and then started bleeding heavily again following. Currently I am still experiencing vaginal bleeding like a period but more frequent (every 2 weeks as opposed to once a month). It has now been 2 months since the last dose of the vaccine and I continue to have this pattern of bleeding. My MD is aware and when I questioned the vaccine, I was told it probably was not related, but offers no other explanation.

                                                Only slight swelling at injection site occurred following the administration of the second dose. Swelling only lasted approximately 2 days. 11 days later on 02/17/2021, my mother was found (at approx 11- 11:30am) to be having a stroke unbeknownst to us. Barely responsive when paramedics came, and going in and out of consciousness.  There were NO typical stroke symptoms not exhibited leading up to the time of stroke on 02/17/21 as she just received a clean bill of health the December prior.

I tried to treat the pain with Tylenol and benadryl, but it wouldn&#39;t go away. I also developed visual aura of zig zag lines on my peripheral vision. I presented to the ER on March 26th, and they did an MRI. MRI showed multiple bilateral strokes. My hospitalist stated I should report it to VAERS.

                                                Almost right after receiving the vaccine, I started to feel sore under my neck and my shoulder. The gave me an ice pack. I took 800mg of Motrin. The same night I started to feel like I had the flu. There was muscle and joint pain throughout my body. I had a headache and my stomach was hurting me. I developed a fever and it went as high as 105 degrees. I called the on-call doctor the next day and she said that I would probably be fine by Sunday. I did not feel better and my symptoms continued. My blood pressure became very high too, and I was advised to see my doctor, but it got better. My knees felt like they were on fire. My appetite went away come completely. On Sunday, I called the doctor again and told her how I was feeling. My doctor told me to go to the hospital to get an IV because I wasn&#39;t drinking fluids. I couldn&#39;t even get out of my bed and I had urinated on myself. I did experience a couple of UTI&#39;s after the vaccine. I told the doctor that I would drink broth and my son made me some. Sunday my fever went up and down and at one point. On Monday I started having a headache again and I was very nauseous. I went back to work on Wednesday with a headache. I took homemade soup and I ate there. I still had a headache throughout the day. On Thursday, I felt a lot better. A few days later, I experienced some dark vaginal bleeding, not related to my period. I had a vaginal ultrasound. I had a biopsy and everything was fine. The heavy bleeding continued and I ended up having to get an IUD to control the bleeding. I had some blood work done and my live enzymes were elevated. I had an ultrasound to check everything. I had a fibroid scan as well. I had an endoscopy. The doctor thinks I might have liver sclerosis. I told him that I do not drink. I&#39;m meeting with my liver doctor tomorrow. There are now complications with my thyroid. I saw an endocrinologist and he said that I may need calcium in my body.

                                                Abnormal menses.  Huge clots.  Velocity and volume of blood extreme.  (Different from previous experiences of menorrhagia).  The only other time I experienced this type of dramatic and concerning bleeding was after I took the Hepatitis vaccine (first shot) about 2 years ago.  I think that&#39;s the only other vaccine I&#39;ve had as an adult.  There is mention of heavy bleeding as a rare side effect for Hepatitis vaccine, and I surely hope you will study this effect from Covid vaccine as it took nearly a year to regulate my cycle after the Hepatitis vaccine reaction.  I&#39;ve seen some reports suggesting that the excessive bleeding that women are experiencing after the Covid vaccine is due to stress and that is just plain insulting.  Stress does affect the menstrual cycle; that is well-known, but this is something entirely different.  I have also had small clots in the nose during the past several days, which again, is highly abnormal for me.  Thank you for looking into the bleeding side effects that hundreds (if not more) women are struggling with at this time.

                                                I had a blood clot in my right leg . It started to bother me on 3/19/21. I called my doctor on 3/22/21 and she advised that I be seen in the ER. The ER doctor confirmed that I had a blood clot in my leg and I was treated with Lovenex. In addition to the clot in my leg, I have multiple bruises on my arms and legs where blood vessels broke in the couple days before and after the ER visit. I also felt very out of shape, with trouble getting enough breath. Within 2 days of getting the Lovenex, I felt like I could breath normally and my symptoms improved. Not sure if it is connected to the vaccine but thought it was important to report. I am an active, otherwise healthy person who walk at least 5 miles daily. The blood clot was very unexpected.

                                                2/5 I received the 1st does of Moderna. The next day I had a massive headache. As the days went on my neck started to heart. The days continued and my back started to hurt. I thought my pain was just radiating down my back from my neck. ON 2/12 I have record of going to the pharmacy to get Lidocain patches. I continued on with pain from neck to middle of back. I made appointments with chiropractor and went there complaining that my back and ribs were out. This continued. On 3/5 I got the 2nd dose. I reacted as expected but this went on for 4 days. Went to a convenient care clinic where the dr ordered chest xray and D-DImer for suspected PEs. I got a call immediately to go to ER as my D-Dimer was high at 4.3. I went back to Local ER and had a CT Scan. The CT scan showed MULTIPLE PEs with infarct. I was admitted. SInce then I have been back to the ER and still struggling and have many tests coming up. My pulse is consistantly tachycardia. The ER docs do not want to entertain the thought that is was the vaccine because i was a smoker and on hormone replacement therapy. HOWEVER, I smoked for over 30 years and was on that HRT for almost 3 and never showed any signs of a clotting issue. I can pinpoint with pictures, and bank records of when the pain started and it reflects back to the 1st dose.  Who knows but after the 2nd does and out of the hospital I struggled with covid symptoms including the &#34;foggy&#34; head and that continues as well as other health related PE issues.  They may not want to contribute it to the vaccine but I know when this all started and it does need to be reported incase others. I have a whole story to tell that doesn&#39;t cover in writing!

Bleeding so heavily medical care was sought after first injection. Thought it might be my IUD, which was removed after the first episode. Full gynecological exam indicated everything was normal. Menstrual bleeding happened again 2 days after second vaccine,  characterized by early arrival, heavy flow and clotting.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Co-suspect product included non-company product SIMVASTATIN for an unknown indication.    The patient&#39;s past medical history included Allergic reaction (MMR vaccine allergic reaction as an infant) in 1973. Concomitant products included PANTOPRAZOLE, SERTRALINE and VARENICLINE TARTRATE (CHANTIX) for an unknown indication, ACETYLSALICYLATE LYSINE (ASPARIN).   On 24-Mar-2021 at 1:00 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient started SIMVASTATIN (unknown route) at an unspecified dose. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced VACCINATION SITE PAIN (arm got little sore). On 25-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ILLNESS (very sick), DYSPNOEA (couldn&#39;t breath) and INCOMPLETE COURSE OF VACCINATION (incomplete course of vaccination). On 25-Mar-2021 at 8:00 AM, the patient experienced MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (very mild heart attack) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and CHEST PAIN (chest started burning). The patient was hospitalized on 25-Mar-2021 due to MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. At the time of the report, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (very mild heart attack), ILLNESS (very sick), CHEST PAIN (chest started burning), DYSPNOEA (couldn&#39;t breath), INCOMPLETE COURSE OF VACCINATION (incomplete course of vaccination) and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (arm got little sore) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, Angiogram: normal (normal) no signs of plaque buildup. On 25-Mar-2021, Blood creatinine: abnormal (abnormal) levels determined patient was having a mild heart attack. On 25-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: normal (normal) Normal.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       The patient was very panicky about getting the second dose for fear that she would have another heart attack. She went to the cardiologist for a follow up and the doctor could not determine why she had a heart attack. The patient reported that it was not a normal heart attack in that her blood pressure and pulse were not raised, but instead, were low. The patient agreed to follow up with her HCP (health care provider).  Treatment for the heart attack included SIMVASTATIN and BABY ASPIRIN to prevent blood clots.

                                                ER visit on 05/09/2021 due to left lower leg pain and swelling. Diagnosis was Superficial thrombophlebitis. Follow-up with primary care on 05/12/2021, then endovascular doctor on 05/19/2021 confirmed diagnosis, no deeper clots found at that time via ultrasound. Received prescription for blood thinner (Xarelto). ER visit on 05/22/2021 due to leg pain higher up the leg. Doctor had recommended ER if pain seemed to move up the leg. Diagnosis via ultrasound of a popliteal vein thrombosis behind the left knee. Follow-up with endovascular doctor, received prescription for blood thinner (Eliquis) instead of Xarelto due to nausea.

                                                7 AM 3/25/2021 - Patient called out to husband from the bathroom where she experienced a syncopal event, then passed out.  An ambulance was called and she was revived for a short period of time.  She was taken to Hospital where she coded 3 times.  She was then life-flighted to second Hospital.  According to the hospital records, tests conducted over the course of several days determined that she had no neurological activity.  Initial reports in the records indicate pulmonary embolism, cardiac and respiratory arrest.  She was on life support for the remainder of her time.  Organ donation is being pursued at present and results of this are pending at time of this report submission.  Date of death is unknown until organ retrieval is accomplished.  Family will be contacted in the next few days to ask further questions about any other kinds of vaccine-related reactions that may have happened more immediately to days after the vaccination on 3/17/2021.  A co-worker thought that she had shortness of breath for 3-4 days before this critical event occurred on 3/25/2021.

This was much worse than I had after having chronic hives for last seven years. I contacted Hospital. I wasn&#39;t short of breath. They said to go to ER but I was not feeling that I needed to do that. I went to a clinic  on the 23rd - and when I was there  the doctor could see more hives appear as I was sitting there. The doctor gave me a prescription for steroids in case I needed it. I doubled up on the Benadryl and the antihistamines - the hydroxyzine that I normally take for the hives. The doctor said the vaccine may not work if I took the Steroids. The medicine just made me sleepy so that I didn&#39;t care if it hurt or not. It was really really uncomfortable. It was really bad for a day and a half and within three days it was gone. With my chronic hives - I can have them come and go in a day but they don&#39;t usually linger at day or more at  a time.

                                                48 yo female who presented today for her first dose of the Moderna vaccine. Vaccine was administered at 1400 in the left deltoid. Patient was directed to go to the observation area for a 15 minute observation period after administration of her Moderna vaccine. While walking, patient was assisted to the floor by two volunteers, amid a suspected seizure. Arriving on scene, patient was unconscious and having a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 20 seconds. EMT&#39;s were on scene placing an 18g PIV in the right forearm, collecting a BG, and had placing the patient on the monitor. Patient was placed on a NRB mask at 15 L of O2. Patient again fell unconscious and had a second tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 20 seconds.    Patient regained consciousness and requested that provider unlock cell phone to collect patient medication list and husband&#39;s information. Husband was contacted and requested to enter to be by her side. Husband reported a history of seizures (tonic clonic) and current treatment/management. He requested that patient not to be taken to the ER. Provider advised husband and patient that the paramedics would determine the necessity of her transfer to the ER.    Ambulance was notified and Fire reported to the patient&#39;s side by 1435. Upon arrival, husband and patient requested not to be transferred to the ER. While answering questions, patient again was assisted to the floor and sustained a third tonic-clonic seizure lasting approximately 20 seconds. Provider aided paramedics in transferring patient to the gurney. Patient was transferred to hospital with husband and all personal belongings.

The next day, it was even larger, by 4/7, it had completely gone away.  Everyone thinks I should also mention that I was admitted to the hospital with chest pain, high BP/Pulse on 3/31, they did a D-Dimer on me and it was elevated, suggesting a clot has formed and is in the process of breaking down. I had a CT of my chest and no PE was found, but I had thickening of my left lobar pulmonary artery wall, further supporting the suggestion of a possible blood clot. After an echo stress test, I was discharged the next day on HTN meds. I was experiencing chest discomfort prior to my vaccine, but again, EVERYONE is telling me I need to report this, so I am. :)

                                                I suffered a severe hypoglycemic seizure which nearly took my life and I believe that it was caused by my recent covid vaccine (moderna). I?m not a diabetic nor have I ever been. I received my second covid vaccine on February 26 and on March 14th at around 6:45 PM and while at work, I suffered a grand mal seizure while working at the Hospital (I?m a respiratory therapist). I was alerted overhead and a team of clinicians rushed to my aid. My glucose was measured and it had decreased to the low 40?s. They had a difficult time getting it to normalize and I ended up being admitted into the ICU. I had a severe tongue laceration and headaches afterwards. Strangely, less than an hour before the seizure, I had eaten a piece of cheesecake so my glucose had no reason to all of a sudden bottom out as it did. There were no other circumstances that could or would have led to a hypoglycemic seizure.

I was lightheaded for a prolonged period of time after the donation; by the time I got home around 11am, my blood pressure was very low and I could not stand up or I would get dizzy and off balance. I was unable to work. My blood pressure resumed to normal the next morning after a full night&#39;s sleep. On April 7, I had an appointment to receive trigger point injections and the nurse practitioner who administered them said I was bleeding at every injection site, which was highly unusual for me.

                                                Patient is hospital employee who completed screening form for COVID-19 vaccine by answering &#34;no&#34; to all contraindication questions.   Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                Patient post vaccine administration approx 20 minutes. Reported feelinging tightness in chest, spreading to throat. Patient was taken to observation portion of clinic. Patient was hypoxic in 70&#39;s. Supplemental oxygen applied. Oxygen saturation increased to 88. Epipen administered and albuterol nebulizer treatment started while waiting for ED/Rapid response team to arrive. Patient transferred to ED for further observation.  From the physician that treated the patient: &#34;It was a bit of a bizarre presentation. She reported throat tightness after the vaccine. She had a completely normal exam and no other complaints. no signs of airway/oral/pharyngeal abnormality. no respiratory abnormality. Unfortunately she was significantly hypoxic when I took her vitals. as low as 76%. Good waveform. I even checked the pulse ox on myself because I didn&#39;t believe it. In addition, with supplemental oxygen, her sats went up. I had to pull the trigger and treat her even though she looked well and I had no objective exam findings to explain her profound hypoxia. She received IM Epinepherine and Albuterol neb. By the time she was in ED she was satting 100% and her throat tightness resolved. So, not sure how to answer your question. Clinically I pulled the trigger and treated her for anaphylaxis following a vaccine administration. I wish it was a problem with my sat monitor but I don&#39;t believe it was. I was using a life-pack with wave form and verified with two other people that the O2 saturation function was working properly. Intuitively, it doesn&#39;t make sense but I think we should probably consider it a reaction to the vaccine. &#34;

                                                Left side stroke-like symptoms. I was walking and 20 minutes in I started having left leg weakness. This then turned into full left side numb/foggy feeling. I was with my son (and I&#39;m a nurse) so I asked him to test for signs of a stroke. I could smile evenly but it didn&#39;t feel like it. I had strength in both hands and could lift my arms. I was able to communicate what to look for to my son without slurred speech. But I was not stable on my left foot and felt as if I was listing to the left side. My left side was foggy. I moved my arm but flet it in slow motion. When I got home, I sat down and stretched. The symptoms went away and I was able to continue the day without episode. The episode lasted 20-30 minutes as I was walking home still. In hind sight, I did have a similar eposide after the first dose (Moderna lot 037K20A on 1/29/20) while exercising at home but sat down and thought it was due to a hard workout. That time it was just a weak left leg that was giving out on me and lasted 5 minutes because I stopped the workout.

Then, 9 days later my left side went numb.  My arm, leg and face went numb. 20 minutes later all feeling did come back.  I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a TIA.  I had many tests completed.  (MRI, EKG, CT SCAN, Echocardiogram)    The only thing that was found was that I have a PFO in the heart.  I am healthy, I eat great, exercise daily at the gym.  AFter an overnight hospital stay and being put on PLAVAX and aspirin my life has changed forever.  I had a doctor&#39;s appointment to discuss the PFO, a meeting with a neurologist and they are not sure why.  The paperwork shares that I had a TIA or a migraine which is not possible because I do know what migraines are like as I had these as a young child. I am now looking into closing the PFO.  I am going to get a second opinion on this based on what happened.

I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  -Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  Considerations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (&#34;tea and toast&#34;), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   - Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

On an echocardiogram, the cardiologist found borderline pericardial effusion and borderline abnormality in wall motion.  My troponin level has now normalized but my chest pain continues.  I continue to follow up with my cardiologist and primary care doctor.

                                                Chose not to get second shot; Deep Vein Thrombosis; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning a 50 year-old, female who received Moderna (mRNA-1273) and developed deep vein thrombosis, and chose not to get second shot.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product was not provided.   On 07Jan2021 (previously reported as 16Jan2021), approximately one week prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 025L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  A week post vaccination, she had a thick painful cord down injection arm and was misdiagnosed with tendonitis. After a second opinion, she was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. On 01FEB2021, an ultrasound confirmed a blood clot and subsequently, she went to the ER. A computerized tomography (CT) of the lungs ruled out pulmonary embolism. Based on these events, the patient chose not to get the second shot.  Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.   The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the event.   The outcome of the events deep vein thrombosis and chose not to get second shot were unknown.   Follow-up information received 08Feb2021 included additional event, date of first dose was updated from 16Jan2021 to 07Jan2021, diagnostic test and treatment.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 50 year-old, female who experienced deep vein thrombosis. Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                I received vaccine doses on 2/16/21 and second on 3/16/21.  Trying to complete good deeds for Lent, I donated Plasma for the first and only time on 3/7/21.  On 3/8/21 my right calf starting seizing up and I was experiencing calf pain.  I was advised to do stretches and use a heating pad. It persisted for over a week and I went for a Doppler ultrasound scan on 3/17/21.  Blood clots were found.  The Plasma donation center screening led me to believe that they were concerned with other vaccines but not the Covid19 vaccine.  Writing report because I  think there is a possible connection to the blood clots, vaccine and plasma donation.  I had to &#34;do nothing&#34; for three weeks and have been placed on Eliquis, a blood thinner for four months.  Follow-up with Dr. for blood work and Doppler in July.

On 3/21 she went to urgent care and was referred to the emergency room because she was also having a pain in her chest.  She had a stress test, EKG, chest xray, and Doppler and was diagnosed with a large DVT in the thigh and a small clot near the ankle.  She was given Lovenox injections inpatient for 3 days and sent home on  Xarelto 15/20mg starter pack and Aspirin 81mg.  She was also started on metoprolol tartrate 25mg and atorvastatin 40mg.  She saw her PCP 4/6 and sees a cardiologist and hematologist within the next couple of weeks for follow-up.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Clot blood (blood clots in heart and lungs for last 15 years) and Thrombectomy (40 clots removed from heart and lungs from past 15 years). Concurrent medical conditions included Systemic lupus erythematosus (bad lupus).    On 15-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 10-Feb-2021, the patient experienced THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced THROMBECTOMY (two clots were removed) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and LEG AMPUTATION (surgery (a leg was amputated)) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced REHABILITATION THERAPY (patient was sent to rehabilitation center). On an unknown date, the patient experienced GANGRENE (Gangrene) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION INTERRUPTED (Missed her second dose as the hospital where the patient was admitted did not have Moderna vaccine). The patient was hospitalized on 10-Feb-2021 due to THROMBOSIS, then on 27-Feb-2021 due to LEG AMPUTATION and THROMBECTOMY. The patient was treated with Surgery for Gangrene. On 01-Mar-2021, THROMBECTOMY (two clots were removed) and LEG AMPUTATION (surgery (a leg was amputated)) had resolved. At the time of the report, THROMBOSIS (Blood clots), PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION INTERRUPTED (Missed her second dose as the hospital where the patient was admitted did not have Moderna vaccine) and REHABILITATION THERAPY (patient was sent to rehabilitation center) outcome was unknown and GANGRENE (Gangrene) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   As per the patient&#39;s doctor, it was too late and dangerous to remove clots from the patient&#39;s leg and eventually, the doctor had to amputate the patient&#39;s leg because of gangrene.  No concomitant medications were reported.

                                                On April 3rd 4PM I had shortness of breath and dizziness. I called the online DR telehealth. I then went to an immediate care where I was sent to the hospital. At the ER I was diagnosed with pulmonary emboli across both lungs. I was then admitted to the hospital. In the hospital, they did an echo which was normal and a stress test. I was put on Eliquis. I was discharged on Monday April 5th  A few days later, I went back to the ER because I had fallen after feeling very dizzy. That was on Tuesday April 6th. They did a scan of my head which was fine so I was sent home. They asked me to follow up with my pulmonologist and my PCP.

                                                This is a 50 year old female, who was identified by me due to anaphylaxis following her 2nd dose Moderna on 5/25/21.  Upon further review of her chart, additional administration errors were identified.  On 4/9/21, the patient received a J&amp;J vaccine dose (lot#1805018, IM, left arm).  A few weeks later, the patients contacted her primary care physician with a concern that she took an ibuprofen prior to the J&amp;J vaccine dose and was concerned about that ibuprofen dose impacted her immune response.  She had spoken to a retail pharmacist who recommended an antibody test to check for immunity.  Her primary care provider agreed that the antibody test &#39;would be reasonable to do.&#39;  The patient took a SARS -COV2 Antibody IGG test on 4/27/21.  The result was negative, and the covering provider communicated to the patient &#39;covid testing is negative.&#39;  No additional chart documentation regarding any communication/interpretation of this lab result as it pertains to her post-vaccination immune status.  The patient reported to the vaccine clinic on 4/30/21 and received her 1st dose of Moderna (lot# 021C21A, IM, left arm).  She reported this was &#39;OK with her PCP,&#39; however no chart documentation to confirm that.  No adverse events reported following either the J&amp;J dose on 4/9, or the Moderna dose on 4/30.  She returned to our vaccine clinic on 5/25/21 and received the 2nd dose of Moderna.  Immediately following that dose, she developed swollen eyelids, itching in her throat, and nausea.  The onsite provider administered diphenhydramine 50mg IM with some improvement.  The symptoms returned within 10 minutes, and the patient was treated with famotidine 10mg orally.  EMS was called and evaluated patient.  The patient refused EMS/transport to an emergency room. The patient then drove herself to a nearby emergency room where she was observed further.  The following day, the primary care clinic contacted patient and she reported resolution of her symptoms.    Overall, likely anaphylaxis following her 2nd dose Moderna vaccine AND duplicate therapy (received both J&amp;J and Moderna vaccines).

I quickly pulled over to a gas station and called 911.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported me via ambulance to the hospital.  En route, I was administered 50 mg of Benadryl.  Diagnosis was anaphylactic reaction to vaccine.

SBP has increased to &gt;140s, note that she held her beta blocker and has recently diagnosed hypertension. Lungs CTA b/l. We discussed that without decreased blood pressure and wheezing at this time and given her chest pressure we will hold off on epinephrine for now as this is not consistent with suspected anaphylactic reaction but given her hypertension history and chest tightness patient been sent to urgent care at this time. We are giving cetirizine 10 mg and discussed that if objective signs of anaphylaxis clearly epinephrine will be given but with current signs/symptoms further observation where EKG may be done is warranted .Pt in NAD.

She was then transferred to Emergency Department. Per their report: The patient presents with a swollen discolored left lower leg.  She does have  discoloration and I am concerned for massive DVT and cerulea dolens.  She does  have really minimal pain to the leg except to the groin, she has intact pulses,  I have low suspicion for acute ischemia/arterial clot.  She does complain of  some mild dyspnea with exertion above baseline so I do have concerns for  possible PE.  She is hemodynamically stable, appears in no distress.  She is on  oral contraceptives, mild obesity, no other significant VTE risk factors.  I am  going to empirically start her on heparin, I have also ordered a CT PE and a CT  abdomen pelvis to check for proximal propagation of the DVT along with a left  lower extremity duplex Doppler ultrasound.    Duplex ultrasound also showed extensive left lower extremity DVT up to the  common femoral, she does have bilateral PEs without evidence of significant clot  burden or heart strain, she is hemodynamically stable with normal pulse  oximetry.  The patient also has clots proximal up to her IVC.  I discussed this  with Dr.  of vascular surgery for possible thrombolysis therapy of the  left lower extremity.  She was discussed with SOUND for admission.

She denied any rash, feeling of swelling in her throat or tongue and had no trouble breathing. Patient declined to have EMTs called because she did not feel it was anaphylaxis.  A dose of 50mg of Benadryl was via orally and she was closely monitored.  Her blood preassure was 128/84 and heart rate was 80.  She had offers to drive her to either the ER or urgent care but declined saying it was isolated to her lips and the tip of her tongue.  Patient is a nurse and was aware of what to watch for.  Pharmacy staff continued to observe her for an additional 45 minutes.  At that time she said the issues were resolving and she would like to go home.  She was counseled on what to look for with worsening reaction but said she felt more frustrated that anything.  Pharmacist encouraged her to reach out to her PCP and also explained we would be unable to give her the next shot at a clinic.  She was advised to speak more with her doctor regarding if she should get a second dose.  Patient was followed up with 2 hours after vaccination by phone and reported symptoms resolved and she was just tired from the Benadryl.  Patient was also called the day after and said she had a bad headache but otherwise no other signs of adverse reaction.

Some hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills, headache, started vomiting and my blood pressure started bottoming up that is when I was rushed to the ER. I was admitted and stayed 2 days. They said it was not related to the vaccine. First they told me it was sepsis. Then they told me it was pneumonia, not sepsis. Then said it was a bacterial infection. I sincerely do not know what I had. I am doing better now. My PCP did not recommend me to receive the second dose.

                                                Anaphylactic shock; severe allergic reaction/felt tonge swell; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK (Anaphylactic shock) and HYPERSENSITIVITY (severe allergic reaction/felt tonge swell) in a 52-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 016A21A and 029A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Sleep disorder, High cholesterol, MS, Shellfish allergy (anaphylactic shock), Iodine allergy (anaphylactic shock) and Allergy NOS (allergy to &#34;many things&#34;). Concomitant products included ATORVASTATIN for High cholesterol, GLATIRAMER ACETATE (GLATOPA) for Multiple sclerosis, VANEX for Sleep disorder, DULOXETINE HYDROCHLORIDE (CYMBALTA), ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (BABY ASPIRIN), BACLOFEN, VITAMIN D3 and FISH OIL (OMEGA 3 FISH OILS) for an unknown indication.   On 04-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021 at 2:05 PM,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced HYPERSENSITIVITY (severe allergic reaction/felt tonge swell) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and life threatening). On 01-Apr-2021 at 4:05 PM, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK (Anaphylactic shock) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and life threatening). The patient was hospitalized from 01-Apr-2021 to 02-Apr-2021 due to ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK and HYPERSENSITIVITY. On 01-Apr-2021, ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK (Anaphylactic shock) and HYPERSENSITIVITY (severe allergic reaction/felt tonge swell) had resolved.            Symptoms of anaphylactic shock included couldn&#39;t breath, throat closed, and face was all red and puffy.   Treatment for the events included epinephrine, intravenous steroids and diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and &#34;other stuff&#34; at hospital.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event of anaphylactic shock, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Patient&#39;s underlying multiple allergies may have been contributory.

I went in the next morning to be seen by my pcp. She said I  had pneumonia. I was out from work for 7 days. I never fully stopped coughing. then it got worse and worse. I was sent for a stat referral to a pulmonologist. I mentioned to my pcp and the pulmonologist I had been like this since 2 weeks after receiving the 2nd dose. Both did not believe that was the case. I now have asthma and I am on inhalers. I have to go in June for a pulmonary function test. The visit to the pulmonologist was 7 weeks after the first symptoms had appeared.

I was admitted to hospital with ITP blood platelet count 4000. After 3 infusions of platelets with no improvement they did a steroid and IVIG. My platelets went up to 51000. After 5 days in hospital they sent me home. Two days later on 6/8/2021 I started having the mouth blood blisters lesions again went back to ED where I was admitted again.  They gave iv steroids in ED.  On 6/9/2021 gave 65mgs of oral steroids and did a IVIG treatment platelets went up to 26000.  On 6/10/2021 continued 65mgs of oral steroids another treatment of IVIG and platelets are at 36000. Not what I or the doctors were expecting we were expecting a higher number. So now 6/11/2021 still in hospital with no answers.

The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

In the evening I was exhausted and could barely move, around 10pm, I think, I started to labor with my breathing. It felt like I would stop breathing and then take 4 gasps for air, and this repeated all night and into the morning. Eventually it stopped the following day, every now and then on the following day I would repeat it but not as often.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; anaphylactic reaction; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of the first episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) and the second episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) in a 53-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 002A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma and Allergy. Concomitant products included EPINEPHRINE (EPIPEN) for Allergy, ALBUTEROL SULFATE for Asthma.    On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced the first episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced the second episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 11-Apr-2021, last episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       The patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction of constricted throat, face and neck turning red, tingling and numbness in her face and throat, red bumps on her face and throat, and her face felt like it was burning. She used her EpiPen and it wasn&#39;t enough (didn&#39;t improve the reaction), so she went to the emergency room. They gave 2 prednisone tabs and prescribed prednisone and gave her IV saline and antihistamine. They released her 2 hours later. Her doctor advised her against getting the second dose. After the patient recovered from initial anaphylactic reaction on 12Mar2021, she had 2 episodes of anaphylactic reaction on 09APR2021, requiring the use of two EpiPens, Benadryl, Prednisone, and albuterol. On 10APR2021 at 0100 another anaphylactic reaction requiring EpiPen, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Albuterol. And at 4pm another anaphylactic reaction requiring Benadryl, EpiPen, and albuterol. Currently she has recovered.

Pains off and on until on 02/09/2021 about 3 am when the pain got so bad I went to the emergency room.  Diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.  Never had a blood clot or DVT before.  Blood test found I had Factor V. Had pain again under ribcage one week after second vaccine, but blood thinners appears to have dissolved if it was a clot.  My father then tested and found positive for Factor V after my diagnosis.  He then had a blood clot in leg approx 3 weeks after his second Pfizer vaccine, and had never had a blood clot like that before.   Appears to be a connection between Factor V and blood clots after Covid vaccines.

                                                My wife presented with severe stomach pain, which was believed to be a sign of pancreatitis (a known adverse effect due to her ALK&#43; lung cancer tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment) so we went to the ER on Apr 23.  Following a CT scan, she was diagnosed with acute appendicitis.  She had elevated IGA and IGG.  Additionally, she was discovered to have a pulmonary embolism.    Through the ER treatment, her blood pressure dropped below 60/40 - which was later discovered to be an unknown allergy to beta lactam antibiotics (piperacillin).  This required her to be admitted to the ICU.  Surgery was scheduled to remove her appendix Apr 24.  Post surgical complications ensued resulting in an additional 9 day hospital stay to correct a herniated surgical site and eventually remove a hematoma.  The NSCLC treatment had started 3 days prior to the vaccine , and was dose escalated on Apr 19th.  The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is particularly susceptible to CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, which she was also taking (e.g. Dexamethasone, omeprazole, and THC).  Her blood pressure was well above baseline at the ER on Apr 23 before the blood pressure crash following administration of piperacillin, which was mostly reversed through administration of norepinephrine.   Whether the appendicitis was triggered by an unsafe pooling of her TKI due to the concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors, or whether the vaccine played a role is unknown.  At the time, we were unaware of the need to avoid CYP3A4 inhibitors.   However the higher IGA levels has been previously shown to tie more to a vaccine response which led us to believe the appendix played a role in IGA levels rather than adverse effects from the TKI and concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors.  For this reason, it was suggested that we fill out a VEARS report.

                                                Patient vaccinated on 1/22.  The next morning (1/23), patient experienced diminished sensory and motor function in left arm and leg, as well as facial numbness.  Presented to the hospital on 1/24, and was found to have a small stroke in pontine medullary junction.  Discharged on 1/25.  There is some suspicion that her COVID infection in December may have precipitated this, and patient is currently being evaluated for coagulation disorders, primarily antiphospholipid antibody testing.  It is unlikely that the vaccine contributed to this, but given close timeline between the two, filing this report.

                                                vaginal bleeding.  I have not had a period in over a year and 2 days after the shot I started bleeding. After talking to others that have had the vaccine, several have had breakthrough bleeding a couple days after the vaccine and thought nothing of it, but people aren&#39;t reporting because they think its just them. I think it should be reported, and maybe some investigation  follow up as to why this may have occurred.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 04 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 04 Jan 2021 the patient experienced headaches after vaccination.  On 05 Jan 2021 the patient&#39;s arm was sore.  On 14 Jan 2021 at 6:00 am the patient&#39;s heart rate started at 136 and went as high as 180. She reported having heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and headaches. The patient went to the emergency room and was hospitalized for 14 hours. She was diagnosed with new onset of atrial fibrillation. While in the hospital she was started on a Diltiazem and Heparin.   On 17 Jan 2021, the patient reported she was now in sinus rhythm but was very tired. Her cardiologist prescribed Rivaroxaban and Metoprolol.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The events, sore arm, headaches, atrial fibrillation, and shortness of breath, were unknown. The event, very tired, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 54 years old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation and non-serious unexpected event of dyspnea, and non- serious expected event of injection site pain, fatigue and headache. The event of headache occurred 1 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 039K20A. The event of injection site pain occurred 2 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 039K20A. The event of atrial fibrillation, dyspnoea, and fatigue occurred 11 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 039K20A. Treatment included Cardizem drip, heparin, Xarelto and Lopressor. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This patient was at work two days after her vaccine and went to the bathroom. When she did not come back to work after around 20 minutes, she was found unresponsive and an ambulance was called. The patient was declared deceased at the  ER with the cause of death initially as cardiac arrest however a full autopsy was performed and  Coroner&#39;s office is awaiting that report at this time. We did not know of the death until we went back this week to complete the second round of vaccinations. Since the death happened in such close proximity to the vaccination date we felt it prudent to report.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Familial hypercholesterolemia, Peripheral arterial disease and Stent placement (has stents in her iliac ery). Concomitant products included ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM (ATORVASTATIN [ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM]), ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (BABY ASPIRIN) and SERTRALINE for an unknown indication.    On 26-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 27-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (possible stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOSIS (small clot that went through and resolved on its own) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MONOPLEGIA (Loss use of left leg/couldn&#39;t use her leg) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and PARAESTHESIA (tingling in left arm) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 27-Mar-2021 to 28-Mar-2021 due to CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT, MONOPLEGIA, PARAESTHESIA and THROMBOSIS. At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (possible stroke), THROMBOSIS (small clot that went through and resolved on its own), MONOPLEGIA (Loss use of left leg/couldn&#39;t use her leg) and PARAESTHESIA (tingling in left arm) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Computerised tomogram: Inconclusive. In March 2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: Inconclusive.   The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.  No treatment information was provided.   Patient reports an MRI and CT scan was done, and she was informed that they suspected she had a small cot that went through and resolved on its own.  Company Comment: Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However patient&#39;s hx of familial hypercholesterolemia, peripheral arterial disease and stent placement are confounding factors that may play a possible contributory role.

                                                So since the vaccination, late night, I started getting chills and fever up to 102/103. I took Tylenol that is all. I did write it all down somewhere because I am a healthcare professional as well. I also had a runny nose, headache, and body aches. On the 10th I started spotting and bleeding that lasted for about 5 days and it was associated with lower abdominal pain. I contacted my PCD and then my OBGYN, I schedule a visit. I scheduled a mammogram and biopsy for breast and uterus. My last ultrasound was last year in July so the pap came out negative and it was just fibrocystic disease. I did consult a surgeon following the biopsy and she also said that it&#39;s ok. My OBGYN said that there have been others that post vaccine have bleeding issues. I am a mechanical researcher in health care. So my vaccine in Feb. and this was all going on March and the 17th of March and I was on the phone and I just fainted. After that I had a cardiovascular evaluation go on and we are not sure what happened.

                                                Anaphylactic shock; feeling some stuff in my throat; A spontaneous report was received from a 56-year-old, female nurse, who was also the patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced anaphylactic shock and feeling some stuff in my throat.   The patient&#39;s medical history included having general allergies. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.    On 28 Dec 2020, immediately prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, while the vaccination needle was being pulled out of the patient&#39;s arm, the patient experienced anaphylactic shock. Two epinephrine injections were used within ten minutes of the reaction. The patient continued to take steroids due to her still feeling some stuff in her throat at the time of reporting. Treatment for the events included two epinephrine injections and steroids.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, anaphylactic shock, was unknown. The event, feeling some stuff in my throat, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 56-year-old female patient with medical history of unspecified allergies requiring Epi-pen,  who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20A), and who experienced a serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock and a non-serious unlisted event of Oropharyngeal discomfort immediately following vaccination.  Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s history of general allergies requiring Epi-pen remain as confounders.

                                                The patient received her first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on 12/29/2020.  However the patient was diagnosed with a positive COVID-19 test on January 4, 2021.  Patient complained of nausea, vomiting, back pain, and sharp chest pain.     On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

                                                On February 8th, 2021 patient came home early from work around noon due to not feeling well. She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture). She was taken to the hospital that evening on February 8, 2021. Patuent experienced a second seizure while at the hospital during a CT scan. Patient later was able to come home February 11, 2021 in the afternoon. Patient now has to wear a neck brace for up to 12 weeks, cannot drive, cannot work for up to 12 weeks, and is still recovering cognitively from the concussion.

                                                Moderna #1 vaccine given at 130pm March 11th 2021. Pt had history of asthma and frequent nebulizer use and had it in car with her for drive-thru vaccine clinic we did at location, which has a large parking lot. We gave 80 doses. Pt checked off anaphylaxis on the intake form so Dr spoke to her and she changed it to no history of anaphylaxis and only has history of asthma. So we gave her the vaccine. About 5 minutes later in car parking lot she started to use her personal nebulizer. I saw her in passenger side of car using a personal nebulizer so I talked to her and her daughter to find out what was going on. They said she has exacerbations all the time and this was not out of ordinary for her. I checked pulse ox and did a lung exam, etc, and she was stable.  She seemed baseline according to history by her and her daughter.  As she seemed at baseline and clinically was comfortable and conversant whole time, and she felt better after her nebulizer, I told them to have a low threshold for going to ER or calling 911 if her asthma was worse or different than her usual symptoms.  They agreed. According to daughter, she did well until about 24 hours the next day. The daughter said she was fine and she went to store and when she returned EMTs were intubating patient and apparently the patient used her epipen and called 911 herself. Approximate time of expiration was 230pm on March12th 2021.

                                                Got her vaccine, went home and her son mentioned to her around 7:30 that her face looked strange.  He told her that it looked like Bell&#39;s palsy.  She didn&#39;t notice anything herself, but her son and husband noticed that something was wrong.  The next morning she got up and her face was swollen on the right side and she could then tell that something was different.  She went to work and the nurse at work suggested that she get it checked out.  She went to the doctor and they diagnosed her with Bell&#39;s palsy on Friday, 2/12/21.  The doctor told her to come back on Saturday to ensure that it didn&#39;t worsen, it did not change.  The doctor ordered a CAT scan and she had that done, and then she wanted to confer with another doctor she wanted her to get an MRI.  She got that done, and told her that she had a mini-stroke from the vaccine.  They initially put her on Prednisone thinking it was Bell&#39;s palsy.  Saturday evening she took her 2nd dose of that, but told her not to take it anymore as that was not the issue.   The doctors then said that they saw some pneumonia, and is being treated for that.  She goes back to see the doctor this afternoon.

                                                Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) in a 57-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 008B21-2A and 010A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Mastectomy bilateral on 20-Jan-2021 and Radiation therapy. Concurrent medical conditions included Breast cancer and Lung cancer (Has not been operated on as of yet).   On 08-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 05-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized on 10-Apr-2021 due to PULMONARY EMBOLISM. At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) outcome was unknown.            No concomitant medications reported.  The patient developed a blood clot in the lower left lung, and was hospitalized. The doctor told her that because of cancer, radiation and recent mastectomy surgery she was at risk of developing blood clots. Treatment medication included apixaban for six months. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Company Comment: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s underlying cancer, radiation and recent mastectomy surgery were considered to be risk factors for developing blood clots.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma (esterase induced.) since 1970 and Drug allergy (Sulfa, PCN). Concomitant products included SERTRALINE HYDROCHLORIDE (ZOLOFT) for Anxiety, ESTRADIOL (ESTRACE) for Hormone replacement therapy, OMEPRAZOLE (PRILOSEC [OMEPRAZOLE]) for Reflux gastritis, VITAMIN D NOS for an unknown indication.    On 06-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 06-Jan-2021, the patient experienced NEURITIS (vestibular neuritis), HEAD DISCOMFORT (heaviness), DIZZINESS (dizziness) and FATIGUE (fatigue/ haven&#39;t been able to drive or work since). On 07-Jan-2021, the patient experienced HYPERSOMNIA (hypersomnia from 7-jan-2021 to 9-jan-2021), HEADACHE (ragging headache), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills) and NAUSEA (nausea). On 08-Jan-2021, the patient experienced TINNITUS (ringing in both ears). On 09-Jan-2021, the patient experienced MALAISE (Overall malaise). On 26-Jan-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe immune response effecting the vestibular system) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and VIIITH NERVE INJURY (severe immune response effecting the vestibular system/vestibular neuritis). The patient was treated with Rehabilitation therapy for Anaphylactic reaction and Rehabilitation therapy for VIIIth nerve injury. On 09-Jan-2021, HYPERSOMNIA (hypersomnia from 7-jan-2021 to 9-jan-2021) and PYREXIA (fever) had resolved. At the time of the report, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe immune response effecting the vestibular system), VIIITH NERVE INJURY (severe immune response effecting the vestibular system/vestibular neuritis), NEURITIS (vestibular neuritis), TINNITUS (ringing in both ears), HEAD DISCOMFORT (heaviness), DIZZINESS (dizziness), MALAISE (Overall malaise), HEADACHE (ragging headache), CHILLS (chills), NAUSEA (nausea) and FATIGUE (fatigue/ haven&#39;t been able to drive or work since) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   On 10 Jan 2021 visited Dr. prescribed with antivert and steroids, no improvement prescribed antibiotics and referred to ENT. ENT diagnosed severe immune response to Moderna vaccine effecting the vestibular septum. Started rehab therapy for 2 weeks. Conducted a VNG (Videonystagmography) test ,She was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis secondary to the COVID 19 vaccine. Treatment medication included shot of solumedrol, Zpack, Medrol dose pack.

I was released from work early and went home. Symptoms progressed to include: vomiting, sweating, shakes, chest pressure and pain in left arm. Paramedics were called the following morning  approx 36 hours after the 2nd vaccine dose. They began treating me immediately and took me to a level 1 trauma center. Emergency angioplasty to place two stents in the LAD to resolve blockages.  The cardiologist in the ER said I arrived with, &#34;not a moment to spare.&#34;

She had some nausea and vomiting and later some diarrhea. Unfortunately, she continued to take her diabetic meds and antihypertensives. Her CT abdomen showed duodenitis.    She presented with multisystem organ failure and severe lactic acidosis.  Despite aggressive treatment, she died less than 24 hours after admission. She was a complex patient and the renal failure and metformin toxicity seemed to be the terminal event, the vaccine may have started the process with some dehydration from nausea and vomiting.

Was treated with warfarin for 11 yrs and due to constant blood draws was switched to xarelto 1 year ago 20mg which she didn&#39;t always take with food. She was admitted on 10/20 with respiratory failure and at that time u/s of b/l le showed b/l dvts without PE thought to be provoked by her illness and hospitalization. She apparently had mx attempts at b/l femoral tlc in the ER.she was started on lovenox for the dvt&#39;s but then developed a large hematoma and she was transferred to unity for placement of an ivc filter on 10/30/20 and was eventually placed back on eliquis. She had a venous doppler 3/3/21 with no evidence of acute dvt and mild narrowing of the L common femoral vein and prox superficial femoral vein c/w residual from old prior dvt. Because Recent ultrasound report showed resolution of prior extensive bilateral DVTs and Only minimal chronic thrombus was seen it was recommended that her IVC filter be removed and Her IVC filter was removed on 4/29/2021.  At that time they noticed small caliber bilateral external and common iliac veins; she is scheduled to be seen in IR clinic next week to discuss potential venography, IVUS and angioplasty with stenting of the bilateral iliac veins. She was continued on eliquis after. Admitted to medical center with LLE acute nonocclusive superimposed upon chronic DVT in the proximal left superficial and profunda femoral veins in the upper thigh requiring lovenox 1mg/kg every 12 hours.

She had routine labs on May 18, 2021 that showed isolated thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 12 thousand. This was confirmed in hospital with a platelet count of 13 thousand the same day. She was admitted to Hospital and seen by hematology. She was treated with glucocorticoids and discharged when her platelet count rose to around 20 thousand. Thus far, she has not had thrombotic events. None of her medications are new. All are stable.   We have prior complete blood counts that showed perfectly normal platelet counts in 2020 and earlier.

Arm started to feel sore as the day went on and was very sore by nighttime. Next day, arm started to feel better and over the next 3 days was no longer sore.  On the morning of the 30th, woke up feeling fine, took a 3.5 mile walk and felt fine. Around 12:30 pm, experienced sudden pain and a burning sensation in the chest and both upper arms. Thought it was possibly heartburn ; took a Prilosec. The discomfort (mild but steady) continued so checked blood pressure which was 141/91. Called cardiologist and went to emergency room per instruction, around 1:30. Admitted overnight with the diagnosis of a mild heart attack and performed a heart catheterization where they found no major blockage. One artery noted 30% blocked but that overall heart function looked good. Discharged on 12/31/2020. -reported by patient via email, on 1/3/2021 @ 4:49pm

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

                                                Pneumonia; Partial left lung collapsed; Injection site cellulitis, red rash around injection site which was tender and itchy; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, who was a 58-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced injection site cellulitis, red rash around injection site which was tender and itchy (injection site cellulitis), cough, pneumonia, and partial left lung collapse (pneumothorax).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 04 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the right arm for COVID-19 infection.  On an unspecified date, a few days after vaccination administration, the patient experienced red rash around the injection site which was tender and itchy and was diagnosed by a nurse as cellulitis, which later resolved.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient began coughing.   On 18 Jan 2021, the patient went to urgent care for a COVID-19 test and the results came back negative. The patient was prescribed dexamethasone for three days, but symptoms did not improve. She again went to urgent care where X-rays was performed which showed pneumonia and partial left lung collapse, she was prescribed erythromycin.   On 24 Jan 2021, patient went to emergency room and was given amoxicillin and advised to see their doctor.   On 27 Jan 2021, her doctor prescribed prednisone and the symptoms started to get better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported, although the patient expressed concern about getting the second injection.  The outcome of events, cough, pneumonia, and partial left lung collapse (pneumothorax), was reported and resolving. The event, injection site cellulitis, red rash around injection site which was tender and itchy, was reported as resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the report lacks critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications.  Noting that cellulitis and pneumonia are usually caused by an infectious agent, both events are considered unlikely associated with mRNA-1273. Pneumothorax is confounded by the pneumonia.

                                                I experienced sudden onset of two types of arrhythmias and my regular tachycardia; atrial flutter, atrial fib, and SVT. Extremely regularly irregular. A colleague called 911. The paramedic put an EKG on me. They decided to fly me off (via med vac, since I live on an island). On the way to the heli pad, the paramedic administered 5 mg of metoprolol and in 2-3 mins the arrhythmia resolved; about 20-25 min duration in all. However on advice of the physician, they flew me to Bellingham where I stayed for 2 hours. The physician on call was fairly uninformative and I left after 2 hours.  This was not supraventricular tachycardia. I have never had this type of arrhythmia before.

I went back on 20th - and they did x-rays - I had pneumonia and a partial lung collapse. On the 20th, They put me on antibiotics and an inhaler. On the 24th I went back to ER, I wasn&#39;t any better. They put me on a different antibiotic. On the 27th, I went back to the doctor  - because I was still coughing really bad and they put me on a different steroid. I was back to work on February 1st. I still have a cough - it hasn&#39;t ever gone away.  I still have to use the inhaler. I never had a cough before this and haventh had to use  inhaler.

Went home and within another 20 minutes had completely lost voice.  Went back to Urgent Care.  Was told again to keep an eye on it or go to ER.  They didn&#39;t even look at me.  My own Doctor was down the street so I went right to her office.  My doctor was not in, so another doctor came right out to look at me.  She checked my breathing and it was okay but I could not speak at all.  She put me on prednisone and Benadryl for several days.  Eventually felt better after meds.  Made appointment with allergist, for follow-up.   He said it was an anaphylaxis reaction.  Was told to not get second dose of Moderna shot. I have since had the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/30/2021 with no immediate adverse reaction, just side effects (chills, severe headache, fatigue, sore arm).

                                                Vaccine induced pancytopenia /  thrombocytopenia - STILL ONGOING WITH TREATMENT.  My mom felt very tired the 2nd day after the vaccine; blood taken ~5 days after vaccination showed lower HgB count (8.8 from her normal range of 11&#43;). She remained at home for recovery and then consulted a hematologist. During this period she still felt extremely tired / dizzy / headaches / couldn&#39;t walk up the stairs without breath. 13 days later - more blood sample was taken and now she is diagnosed with pancytopenia - lowered count of RBC (it down further), HgB (down further to 7.1), and Platelets (down to 80 from ~170 her first blood sample). And she was hospitalized. They gave her Prednisone, and a blood transfusion at the hospital. During this first stay - her RBC / HgB and Platelets seemed to have stablized and went higher but they didn&#39;t pay attention to her WBC - which went down to 2 (below normal range). A day later during follow up around WBC - it went lower to ~1.2 (her platelets ~117). She developed a fever - now it is considered a neutropenic fever and she was hospitalized once again (platelets was back down to 84 at the beginning of her stay). During this past week in the hospital, they gave her meds to induce WBC growth - which worked but it overshot to 12 (above normal range) and at the same time her platelets and RBC and HgB dipped again lower. Platelets dipped to 43 on Saturday along with HgB down to  7.1 after 2 days of sustained high WBC count so they gave her IVIG and another blood transfusion. After that, her WBC dropped a little further and is stabilizing around 6 along with HgB around ~10. However her platelets remain high volatile - it went to 51 on Sunday, dropped to 46 on Monday, and now it is 38 today. She was discharged from the hospital today and we have a standing order to have her blood tested everyday.

My symptoms got worse one the next week and a half. I went to an emergency room on 3/28/21 and was admitted to an ICU with a Saddle Embolus of Pulmonary Artery with Acute Cor Pulmonale. Many blood clots in my lungs and one very large one in the artery between my heart and lungs. I am now on Blood Thinners.

I reported to nurse and he called back saying if I get worse make an appointment.  Over night and into the next day I began having upper left quadrant pain with painful inspiration.  I thought it was gas and took something to help belch ( a soda) but still no relief. Saturday night I went to the ER,  a CT with contrast was done and a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism with infarction was made and I was admitted at that time. I am home now on oxygen and blood thinner Eloquis with permanent tissue death. I believe this could be vaccine related. &#34;

Urgent Care Doctor prescribed Eliquis for treatment. See Continuation Page for subsequent events/treatments.   04/07/2021:  Meeting with Primary Care Physician (PCP).  PCP changed treatment for the blood clot [acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT)] from Eliquis to Lovenox/Coumadin.  Additional tests ordered:  CBC with Differential; PTT; Comprehensive Metabolic Panel; Protime INR; Sedimentation Rate.  04/08/2021:  Meeting with PCP to discuss DVT.  PCP ordered Noninvasive Vascular Imaging - External Scan.  04/15/2021:  Meeting with PCP to discuss DVT.  PCP instructed to continue treatment with Lovenox and keep appointment with hematologist on 04/20/2021.  PCP ordered the following tests:  CBC no Differential; Comprehensive Metabolic Panel; Protime INR.  04/20/2021:  PCP changed recommended treatment of DVT from Lovenox to Eliquis.  04/20/2021:  Meeting with hematologist to discuss DVT.  Dr. agreed with PCP to change treatment from Lovenox to Eliquis.  Dr. ordered the following immediate tests:  Antiphospholipid Ab Panel; CK Total; Comprehensive Metabolic Panel; Dilute Russel Viper Venom Confirm; Fibrinogen; Lupus Anticoagulant Profile; NT-PRO BNP; Phospholipid, Hexagonal Phase; VAS Porto Hepatic Duplex.  Additional future tests were ordered as follows:  Antiphospholipid Ab Panel, CK Total; Fibrinongen; Lupus Anticoagulant Profile; NT-PRO BNP.  04/23/2021:  Meeting with hematologist to discuss DVT.  Dr. suspects the DVT is related to pre-existing conditions (includes vitamin K deficiency) plus the effect of the first Moderna vaccine.  Dr. concluded that vitamin deficiencies (due to malabsorption issues) are the root cause of several ills.  Dr. ordered an injection of vitamin K and recommended continued treatment with Eliquis.  Dr. also stated &#34;I think no to second vaccination #2.  She might be vaccinated later if vitamin def are resolved.&#34;  Dr.  plans to review the case in three months to determine if Eliquis treatment can be discontinued.  Dr. also ordered an &#34;ECHO Complete&#34; to rule out additional clots in the heart/lungs.

                                                I had a patient come in at 10:05am for a Moderna Covid vaccine. Just before 11am we received a call from the patient&#39;s roommate that the patient arrived home and collapsed, it was also mentioned her blood pressure was high. We explained that they needed to call 911 but the patient did not want to go to the hospital. We explained that this patient must go to the hospital and get evaluated. They did end up calling 911.  Approximately 45 minutes later I received another call from the patient&#39;s roommate that EMS did not believe this was a reaction from the vaccine. The roommate mentioned that she was in fact mistaken about the blood pressure and it was actually low (92/54 mmHg). She also mentioned that the patient was vomiting.   Around 1:45pm I received a call from the roommate to tell me that the patient had died.

I had terrible pain and bloating. I became light headed and weak, I had chills and a slight fever. This lasted three days. I went to urgent care, they sent me to my doctor. they ran tests and could not find any reason for my bleeding. It has since stopped but I still have some pressure by my overies.

Within a few minutes my entire right side, except my face started to go numb. I had pins and needle feelings in most of my right side also. I believed I had somehow pinched a nerve and thought that it would right itself. My right arm was uncontrollable if I tried to lift it. It would swing wildly up/down and sideways. I was unable to grasp or hold anything. No changes for better or worse on 4/19/2021 so I went to the ER. I had two CT scan, one with and one without contrast. They said they suspected a stroke. I still thought it was probably a pinched nerve, seeing as my face and speech weren&#39;t affected. After leaving the ER, my pcp had me get an MRI and the results came back as a stroke. I&#39;ve also had a heart and carotid sono.  I had no previous health issues and was taking no medications. The stroke didn&#39;t prevent me from walking but the pins and needle feeling makes it painful. My entire right side is sill numb with pins and needle feeling in my hand and foot. I&#39;m still unable to use my hand because I can&#39;t grasp or hold anything. I am going to occupational therapy for my hand. My doctor has me taking an aspirin once daily. I have had very little change since the onset. I was a young and healthy 58 yr old female with no medical issues.

Went to pharmacist who had me sit down, within 30 seconds could not swallow. Pharmacist injected me with Epi Pen and called 911. Paramedics arrived gave more epinephrine, oxygen, started breathing treatment. Lost my voice as throat started to tighten more. Taken to Hospital where I was given Benadryl, steroids, stomach meds, more fluids and another breathing treatment since my lungs were so tight, I could only take shallow breaths. The crated my lungs, did blood work and kept me overnight for observation because I have a history of secondary reactions when I experience anaphylaxis. I was released from the hospital on 2/20/2021 at 2pm.

I fainted and cut my forehead in the fall.  I was shaking uncontrollably following this.  My husband bandaged my forehead and checked me for a concussion.  Sometime after 2am I realized I was in atrial fibrillation.  I have a Kardia app that confirmed this.  I tried at home methods to go back in rhythm.  At 8am I called my cardiologist.  He advised me to go to the emergency room.  At this time the Kardia app indicated I was no longer in Afib but still had a fast heartbeat.  At the emergency room I had a normal EKG, CAT scan, blood work and chest X-ray and went home about 11am.

She even looked like she was gasping for air. An epipen was administered and within seconds she was able to breathe. 911 was contacted upon initiation of the reaction. EMS arrived within minutes after administering the epipen. She was assessed by paramedics and it was determined that the patient would be ok. I called husband in the afternoon to check on patient and he stated that she was good. I also followed up on 03/05/2021 with the patient and she stated that other than soreness that she was fine. I let patient know that since she had a reaction to the first dose, that she would not be able to receive the second dose.

                                                Pain started on inside of right calf on 3/23/2021, but continued to spread up and down from just above ankle to groin area. Three areas were extremely painful to touch. Diagnosed as blood clots in the saphenous vein. Put on ibuprofen, keflex and famotidine on 3/29 and advised to elevate and use moist heat to help clots resolve. Pain started subsiding on 4/3 but is still there, just not as bad. Referred to vascular surgeon, on 4/6/2021. He recommended following advice from  since they seem to be resolving and are not in the deep femoral vein. As of today, 4/13/2021, pain is still there although somewhat improved.

Dose 2 - 1:45 p.m. 4/16/2021 - two days later, like clock work, period cramping, heavy spotting. Dose 1 - spotting lasted 14 days, stopped the morning of my pelvic ultrasound to determine if there was something serious going on. Dose 2 - spotting started two days after vaccine, counting the days to see how long this lasts, with cramping. I am 59, no kids, never been pregnant, last period at age 39, menopause at 42 and still in menopause.  What is going on Moderna? A vaccine should not interfere with hormones or hormone replacement therapy. A vaccine cost me additional procedures  - still waiting on the bill for the ultrasound and several doctor appts, and lab work.

                                                Patient received the vaccine around 7:17pm on Wednesday, May 26th, 2021. She waited for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. She reported a funny/metal taste in her mouth and upon investigation, case reports showed this is a possible side effect of the Moderna vaccine. The reports said this was a self-limiting side effect with an unknown cause. The patient did not report any other side effects such as pulse rate, sweating, nausea/vomiting, headache, anaphylaxis, etc. Patient did not seem concerned. She called a week later to report that she had a stroke 72 hours later on Saturday, 5/29, in the evening. She reported experiencing a similar taste change when she received the contrast dye during her CT scan. She also had muscle cramps prior to the stroke. She is now out of the hospital and can no longer walk.

                                                On the 7th, I had the rash. The 8th is when I had the body aches and chills. The 9th is when I started with the diarrhea, nausea and chest pains which started at 4pm after all day having experiencing the diarrhea. Chest pains stopped at 7pm. The 10th I woke up and couldn&#39;t breathe and had to sit on the bed to iron my uniforms. First night I was having the chest pains, I was really hot and later that day it dropped and went down low. I took an ambulance after taking baby aspirin at home. The ambulance came home which they hooked me up to the EKG, checked normal vitals and ran tests. They took me to the hospital and gave her 3 nitroglycerin tablets. I swear I have PTSD from this because the pain was unbelievable from 12 on a 10 level scale. The pressure backed off once I took these tablets. The hospital gave me heparin and nitroglycerin drips. I stayed in the hospital for a day in a half. It was an embolism going into my heart. I left the hospital with Eliquis and dropped the dosage down after seeing a cardiologist and pulmonologist. I was at work after a week after getting a cardiac cath. I work in an elementary school so I went back to school after this. They believe it was the vaccine but were not certain. I didn&#39;t want to take a chance which is why I am reporting it.
