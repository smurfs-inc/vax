                                                Patient received Moderna Covid vaccine on Friday evening 1/8/21.  She awoke Saturday am around 2AM with a severe headache.  She also developed a fever during the day.  She did not seek treatment until Sunday and went to Hospital ED.  She was treated and released same day.  She went back to hospital on Monday as she felt worse and she was admitted at that time and treated for a bloodstream infection and meningitis.  We are not sure it was caused by the vaccine.  She consulted her PCP and her PCP feels it may be more coincidental given her medical HX.

                                                On January 4 at 2:00 pm I suddenly started to bleed from the nose from the left nostril and then from both. The event lasted more than 35 minutes so I had to go to the ER. The diagnosis was Epistaxis. I was discharged because at the time of the medical evaluation I removed a large clot from my mouth and the bleeding stopped.  Appointment with primary physician for diagnosis and appointment with ENT was ordered. On January 5 at 4:15 am I had another episode of nasal bleeding lasting 25 min. After removing a clot through the mouth, the bleeding stopped. At 4:00 pm I presented Epistaxis again so I had to return to the Emergency Room. I was reevaluated and the instruction was to visit the ENT and Afrin prescription for three days and Claritin D q 12 hrs PRN. From January 6 to 9, I began to eliminate a serous-bloody vaginal discharge. That began with the elimination of a clot and progressively diminished day by day.  January 11, 2021, the ENT evaluated me and indicated that it did not observe polyps or anatomical problems. I had not previously prolonged nosebleeds. Previously two minor episodes happened to me, a year ago that resolved in less than 7 minutes. I didn&#39;t have a cold or any other symptoms.  I want to raise the flag because it was a strange event that occurred after the vaccination and that I had not experienced before in that way.My next dose is January 29, 2021. I am awaiting clot test results

No other symptoms.  For 2nd vaccine, the vaccine itself was extremely painful (burned and pain at site and tingled down to fingertips for a few hours. Applied pressure as I bled for 10 min after administration. Followed by ice off and on for 20 min for first 2 hours.  At 22 hours, I started to feel nauseated and lightheaded and had mental fogginess. The following morning, I awoke around 3am and was very ill with flu like symptoms. mild temperature of 99.8, chills, body aches, fatigue, rapid pulse, headache, sore throat, and mental fogginess. This lasted for approx. 36 hours. The worse symptoms were the headache, fatigue, and severe body aches that lasted for 72 hours after vaccine.

                                                On 1/30/2021, I developed a mild headache followed by an acute change in my vision.  I went to  the emergency room 24 hours later after the symptoms had not resolved and was found to have a left superior quadrantanopia and a 2.3cm x 1.9cm hemorrhage in my right occipital lobe. I was admitted to hopsital and discharged today 2/3/2021.   My headache has resolved but I continue to have a visual field deficit.  I had been scheduled to receive the second dose of Moderna on 2/1/2021 but was unable to receive it due to my hospitalization.

Initially, pt experienced palpitations and tightness in throat after vaccination  and wasn&#39;t sure if she was experiencing swelling in her arms.  BP was 130/79 and HR 93 initially.  Pt started to feel better without intervention but given diphenhydramine as a precaution while we continued to monitor her.  10 mins later she started to have tingling in lips and tongue and visible lip swelling  in addition to palpitations.   Immediately administered Epipen (0.3mg) x 1.  EMS was called.  No worsening but not improvement after 5 mins so a second dose of Epipen (0.3mg) was administered.  By the time EMS arrived (9 mins after first epipen dose) pt was feeling better, swelling had resolved, no throat tightness.  Pt was transported to local hospital by EMS for monitoring.

                                                I developed a sudden, sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my head while at work. I had not fallen nor had any injuries/illness. I went to ER; CT scan was concerning for clot in sinus so I was sent via ambulance to inpatient neurology where further MRI/MRV scans determined it was not in fact a clot, but a small bleed of unknown origin. Again, I had no injuries. I was hospitalized while multiple scans were completed along with lab work. Home now following up with neurology, still have head pain, unable to fully work, etc. Hematoma is still there but not growing.

                                                During the 15 minute observation following the 1st Moderna vaccine dose, the patient reported her tongue &#39;felt thick,&#39; flushed skin, redness on face, neck, hands, BP=98/60, HR=100.  Patient felt &#39;jittery&#39; and &#39;heart racing.&#39;  Was transferred to ED for evaluation given that patient reported her tongue &#39;getting tighter.&#39;  In the ED, the patient was treated with diphenhydramine 25mg x 2 doses, methylprednisolone 125mg x 1 dose, famotidine 20mg x 1 dose, and NS IV fluids.  Hypoglycemia was ruled out with CBG=87.  The physician avoided treatment with epinephrine due to it being listed on her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;shortness of breath.&#39;  Symptoms resolved over the next 3 hours.  The patient was discharged home with a new prescription of oral prednisone taper.  Subsequent follow-up with her primary care provider, in consultation with an ID provider, recommended that this patient NOT get a 2nd dose.  Covid-19 vaccine was added to her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;anaphylaxis.&#39;

                                                Have had tiredness since 2nd vaccine in February and noticed shortness of breath when walking or going up stairs in mid March.  Around 4/1, I started having left rib pain preventing me from sleeping on my left side and then could not breath during a massage on 4/8.   On April 9th, I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms (clots) in both lungs, reducing my lung capacity to only 30% of normal.  This could be due to Loestrin birth control but I have taken hormones in the past for IVF and when younger for birth control.  The reaction may be due to a combination of vaccine, Loestrin and iron but triggered by vaccine.  I am currently on Eliquis to treat pulmonary embolisms.

                                                3/2 - Received the first round of Moderna vaccination. No immediate side-effects noted.  I talked with my physician prior to getting the vaccine due to medical conditions and medications that I am taking. I was taking Xarelto due to chronic DVT/Blood clots in my left leg.   After 2.5 weeks I noted my left leg was swelling and I started to have discomfort in my leg. No noticeable changes to my leg at this time that made me concerned about getting the second vaccine.   3/30 - I received my second vaccination in the morning. I ended up going into the hospital at 4 pm due to numbness and pain in my left leg. I ended up being admitted to the hospital due to a DVT behind my L knee and in my femoral/iliac veins. I was also diagnosed with May-Thurbers syndrome. All the physicians, hematologists, and surgeons were surprised that I ended up with a severe blood clot as I was on Xarelto for over two years without an incident or problem. I did not have a fall or any change in my life that would have caused this issue to happen and they were all stumped.  I was switched to a heparin drip while Xarelto was clearing out of my system and in two days I had two stints put in my femoral/iliac vein on my left leg.  I was changed over to Lovenox and Coumadin 5-7.5 mg before leaving the hospital. There were no concerns and I was in the hospital from 3/30 to 4/3/21.  After I was discharged from the hospital I went to my primary care follow up on Tuesday 4/6/21. I was having increased pain behind my knee and overall not feeling well. I ended up having more labs completed and another ultrasound to indicate I had a small DVT behind my knee from my procedure.   On Friday 4/9/21 I went in for my INR and found my coumadin was within therapeutic range. When I got home I changed into comfy clothing and noted that I had a red/purplish rash looking dots/bumps from my toes to my knees on both LE, my Left was more significant than my right. I went back into the doctor and I was prescribed a topical steroid to help decrease the edema, pain and redness.   Saturday 4/10/21 - my legs became painful to the touch, they felt like they were going to burst due to pressure, and the rash/reddness was looking worse and spreading. I was sent back to the ER and was admitted back to the hospital. They diagnosed me with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, removed me off of coumadin, and started me on Arixtra. The hematologist, physicians and staff did not know what to do and I was now deemed medically complex and had to be monitored for a few days and gave me prednisone. Once removed from coumadin the rash/pain/swelling subsided and started to diminish. I was discharged from the hospital.  I returned to work on Tuesday 4/13 and after returning home I had increased pain, pressure and rash that now was visible from my knees to my hips and this was not present in the hospital. My physician is asking for a biopsy and increased my prednisone to stay at 20 mg a day.  At night I have to elevate my legs or they become swollen and will become painful.   4/16/21 I wore compression tights per physician guidelines and when I came home from work I had new spots and rashes on my feet, they were swollen and had increased pain. My left ankle had a rash on it as well. After elevation and a nights rest the rash started to diminish and the rest of my legs have started to diminish or disappear.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 20 Jan 2021 at 18:00, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection, the patient began to have tongue swelling. She was given diphenhydramine and epinephrine by epi pen. She went to the emergency room where she displayed symptoms including a fast heart rate, wheezing, and shortness of breath with an angioedema or anaphylaxis like appearance. She was given more epinephrine, famotidine, scheduled diphenhydramine at 50 QAs intravenously (IV), IV steroids, was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She was on the ventilator for approximately 18-20 hours following admission. She eventually responded to a high dose of dexamethasone. She was also given duonebs for her shortness of breath, regular sedation for the ventilator, and a dose of ketorolac. Consent was given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events were unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred approximately 10 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration. She was treated with epinephrine, famotidine, diphenhydramine, IV steroids, intubated and placed on a ventilator.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

The employee worked her regular schedule 4/2/21 and 4/5/21 with no stated complaints.  On 4/6/21, received notification from the Employee that she was to be off work through 4/12/21 as her physician feels that the vaccine has damaged her heart.

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on 1/1/21.  Initially, I had a sore arm for 24 hours but otherwise no problems.  Then, on day 8, my left deltoid area started itching and there was a red, slightly raised area just larger than a golf ball. I called the  hotline at that time and took a Benadryl.  Then, 24 hrs later, the area had expanded to over 3 times the size and felt warm. I actually went and saw a friend who lived in my neighborhood who is a general surgeon and he thought I should get it checked out to make sure it wasn&#39;t an NSTI.  Being Saturday at 9pm, I went to the ER  where they started me on Keflex/Bactrim for a presumed cellulitis.  By the next morning, the redness and itching were gone and my arm felt totally back to normal the next day after that. Unfortunately, on day 3 of the antibiotics (Tuesday the 12th), I had symptoms of anaphylaxis (chest tightness, wheezing, throat clearing, lip swelling, hoarse voice, impending doom sensation).  I took Benadryl 50mg and got my epi pen ready but did not use it.  (I have a tree nut allergy).  The symptoms resolved completely about 1 hour later.

                                                Nurse did hit a capillary and I bled immediately after injection- enough where it ran down my arm and went onto floor. I felt pretty okay except for the feeling of my arm hot and fuzzy and fuzzy fingers on my left hand until my &#34;leave time&#39; of 10:03 am. I stayed a little longer, and was home by 10:30 when I became extremely nauseous, dry heaving, left side of face numb. Headache started at 10:40. Tried calling medical facility but was on hold for soo long- no one answered so since I don&#39;t have insurance I decided to just rest and drink fluids. By 11:40 my face was back to normal, no longer nauseous but extremely lethargic and was the rest of the day. The following day I felt ok -slight swelling on my arm at injection site and a bruise that I still have.

                                                The evening (3/20/21)I received the vaccine I noticed fatigue, headache and chills. The next morning I developed shortness of breath. The day after that my left left began swelling for no reason, was slightly discolored and warm to the touch. As the week went on my shortness of breath became greater and my leg more swollen. On (3/26/21) I sent to the ER by my doctor. Had a ultra sound and discovered an extensive DVT in my left groin down to behind left knee. Had a CT and discovered blood clots in my lungs. I had never had any underlying health conditions or been on medications, don&#39;t smoke, no complaints prior. Was transported to hospital spent 2.5 days in ICU before being moved to a regular bed for a total of (4) days hospitalized. The doctor installed two sheaths on each side of groin, injected my lungs with medication to blast/dissolve the clots and installed a filter in the main artery to catch any clots that may break away from leg. I was also put on a Heparin drip while in ICU. The next day the doctor went and the procedure was a success dissolving the clots. He removed the sheaths. I went back to ICU. The next day (3/28/21) a second utlra sound was done to left leg and DVT is still in left leg. Have been described Eliquis blood thinner.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving injection in right arm I felt a BOOM flush all over my body like I just had an IV Contrast.  Then I became dizzy, my heart started racing, I started cold sweats and felt tightness in my mid upper chest to the base of my throat.  The ED RN on site took my BP and HR and had me lie down because I felt that I couldn&#39;t breath.  She called paramedics who took my BP and HR, then did a 12 lead EKG.  They transported me to the ED.  I was worked up for cardiac, lung, chemistry.  My troponin-HS was slightly elevated and a cardiologist was called.  He did an echo on my heart, liver and right kidney -- normal.  Chest X-ray was normal.  A second 12 lead EKG was done, normal sinus.  Hematology, Chemistry was normal.  Was in the ED from 11:30 to 4:00 p.m.  Advised by ED Doctor, and Cardiologist, that it seems the stress of the anaphylaxis reaction stressed the heart which caused the spill of troponin.  Advised to see my cardiologist and get a stress test.  I have already informed my Primary Care Doctor and he has prescribed me an EPI-PEN to carry.  I have no history of allergic reactions/anaphylaxis reactions to vaccines.  I am up to date with all other vaccines and just had my yearly flu shot in November 2020.  This was my first allergic reaction/anaphylaxis reaction to a vaccine.

Her husband reported she had not unexpected fatigue,  malaise, and fever for 1 day but better after that.  On Monday she began complaining of shortness of breath.  This progressively worsened and she started having presyncopal episodes.  On Saturday she was unable to come down the stairs in the house so husband planned to take her to the hospital but she stood up and passed out and woke up quickly.  He decided to call EMS.  By the time she presented to our hospital she was cyanotic and agonal breathing.  On moving her from EMS stretcher to ED bed she had PEA cardiac arrest.  She underwent mechanical device CPR with only brief (&lt;1 min) ROSC x1.  She at some point did have a shockable rhythm.  Cath lab was notified and she was taken emergently to the cath lab with ongoing mechanical device CPR.  Peripheral VA ECMO was placed after about 1.5 hours.  Pulmonary angiogram was done which showed massive saddle PE with near complete obliteration of the right pulmonary tree and some filling defects in the left tree as well.  At that time she had severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 24.  She also had no gag or corneal reflex, minimally responsive pupils, and no response to noxious stimuli.  Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted with some result.  She was transferred to the SICU with increasing pressor requirement, and DIC.  Ultimately, the venous catheter of the ECMO circuit malfunctioned thought to be secondary propagating IVC thrombosis.  Family decided to withdraw care and she passed away.

On  3/6/2021 at 11:24 AM I presented  with dizziness, slurred speech, a feeling of my lip dropping to the right, and weakness in left upper extremity.  Called my daughter whom arrived within 10 minutes. After asking me some questions and exercises she  said my strength in the left upper extremity was weak compared to the right.  My daughter took me to ER, at check in I said I think I had a stroke. I was admitted, and neurology was consulted. In the ER they called it a TIA, and after imaging a  diagnosis of stroke was made.    Acute frontoparietal infarct, ASA/plavix, lipitor, PT/OT, Neurologist follow up.    After discharge I have been meeting with PT/OT following exercises. Met with my PCP and continued medications Aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg. Still have muscle aches, and pain in the left upper extremity- especially 3rd and 5th digits.

The patient denied having any allergies, past medical history or concomitant medications.  Therefore, no medical history or concomitant medications were reported.  On 14-Jan-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #: 251L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10-Feb-2021, approximately twenty-four days prior to the onset of events, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #: 16M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Mar-2021 the patient had a &#34;TIA&#34; (transient ischemic attack). She was sitting down and when she got up, she got dizzy and her left arm was paralyzed. The right side of her face was drooping, she had slurred speech and she was confused. The patient went to the hospital where she was hospitalized for 2 days. The MD (medical doctor) said she had a &#34;7 mm focal diffusion.&#34;  Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event(s); therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event(s) is not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, TIA, dizzy, her left arm was paralyzed, right side of her face was drooping, slurred speech, and she was confused, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient a 46 yo female with a history of Bechet&#39;s presenting to the ED yesterday due to a history of progressive bruising with later appearance of petechiae and gum bleeding.   CBC yesterday revealed an isolated thrombocytopenia with platelets of 19k (&gt;340k all previous checks), suspected ITP.  She was given 1 unit of platelets, solumedrol x 1 and IVIG.  Platelets this morning have responded but more likely related to the platelet transfusion.    Today I discussed continuation of IVIG and transitioning over to pulse dexamethasone 40 mg x 4 days q 14 days for 4 cycles in order to put the ITP in remission.   Considerations for precipitating event leading to the ITP include autoimmune condition recently undergoing dose adjustment, history of recent infection (viral gastroenteritis), and post Covid 19 vaccination induced ITP-currently described incidence between 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 and seen between 1-3 wks after vaccination.     This is unlikely to be related to vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) as there is no sign of clotting.  In addition she received an mRNA vaccine (Moderna) which has not been reported to cause VITT. A HIT antibody was sent.

                                                Three days after initial Moderna Vaccine, I developed signs and symptoms consistent with DVT. I presented to my PCP&#39;s office for evaluation on Thursday; February 4 and was sent for an ultrasound at Imaging. Ultrasound of right leg showed 2 DVT&#39;s. I was started on Pradaxa but experienced an adverse reaction (excessive bleeding with menstruation) which resulted in an emergency room visit on 2/8/2021 and 2 additional days of prescribed bed rest.

                                                2/5 I received the 1st does of Moderna. The next day I had a massive headache. As the days went on my neck started to heart. The days continued and my back started to hurt. I thought my pain was just radiating down my back from my neck. ON 2/12 I have record of going to the pharmacy to get Lidocain patches. I continued on with pain from neck to middle of back. I made appointments with chiropractor and went there complaining that my back and ribs were out. This continued. On 3/5 I got the 2nd dose. I reacted as expected but this went on for 4 days. Went to a convenient care clinic where the dr ordered chest xray and D-DImer for suspected PEs. I got a call immediately to go to ER as my D-Dimer was high at 4.3. I went back to Local ER and had a CT Scan. The CT scan showed MULTIPLE PEs with infarct. I was admitted. SInce then I have been back to the ER and still struggling and have many tests coming up. My pulse is consistantly tachycardia. The ER docs do not want to entertain the thought that is was the vaccine because i was a smoker and on hormone replacement therapy. HOWEVER, I smoked for over 30 years and was on that HRT for almost 3 and never showed any signs of a clotting issue. I can pinpoint with pictures, and bank records of when the pain started and it reflects back to the 1st dose.  Who knows but after the 2nd does and out of the hospital I struggled with covid symptoms including the &#34;foggy&#34; head and that continues as well as other health related PE issues.  They may not want to contribute it to the vaccine but I know when this all started and it does need to be reported incase others. I have a whole story to tell that doesn&#39;t cover in writing!

                                                Roughly 7 to 10 days after injection I presented with raised, red and itchy injection site.   Roughly 13 days after the injection I presented with a tight right calf muscle that felt similar to a constant &#34;charlie horse&#34;. It  continued to worsen over the next 5 days until my right foot went numb and cold on Sunday April 4. I called my doctor the next day (Mon April 5) and they got me in that day and I went to the hospital the same day for an ultrasound. The hospital confirmed I had a blood clot in my lower leg.

                                                7 AM 3/25/2021 - Patient called out to husband from the bathroom where she experienced a syncopal event, then passed out.  An ambulance was called and she was revived for a short period of time.  She was taken to Hospital where she coded 3 times.  She was then life-flighted to second Hospital.  According to the hospital records, tests conducted over the course of several days determined that she had no neurological activity.  Initial reports in the records indicate pulmonary embolism, cardiac and respiratory arrest.  She was on life support for the remainder of her time.  Organ donation is being pursued at present and results of this are pending at time of this report submission.  Date of death is unknown until organ retrieval is accomplished.  Family will be contacted in the next few days to ask further questions about any other kinds of vaccine-related reactions that may have happened more immediately to days after the vaccination on 3/17/2021.  A co-worker thought that she had shortness of breath for 3-4 days before this critical event occurred on 3/25/2021.

                                                Woke up on 4/4 with a golf ball sized, raised welt at the injection site. It was hot and very red. The next day, it was even larger, by 4/7, it had completely gone away.  Everyone thinks I should also mention that I was admitted to the hospital with chest pain, high BP/Pulse on 3/31, they did a D-Dimer on me and it was elevated, suggesting a clot has formed and is in the process of breaking down. I had a CT of my chest and no PE was found, but I had thickening of my left lobar pulmonary artery wall, further supporting the suggestion of a possible blood clot. After an echo stress test, I was discharged the next day on HTN meds. I was experiencing chest discomfort prior to my vaccine, but again, EVERYONE is telling me I need to report this, so I am. :)

Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                Patient post vaccine administration approx 20 minutes. Reported feelinging tightness in chest, spreading to throat. Patient was taken to observation portion of clinic. Patient was hypoxic in 70&#39;s. Supplemental oxygen applied. Oxygen saturation increased to 88. Epipen administered and albuterol nebulizer treatment started while waiting for ED/Rapid response team to arrive. Patient transferred to ED for further observation.  From the physician that treated the patient: &#34;It was a bit of a bizarre presentation. She reported throat tightness after the vaccine. She had a completely normal exam and no other complaints. no signs of airway/oral/pharyngeal abnormality. no respiratory abnormality. Unfortunately she was significantly hypoxic when I took her vitals. as low as 76%. Good waveform. I even checked the pulse ox on myself because I didn&#39;t believe it. In addition, with supplemental oxygen, her sats went up. I had to pull the trigger and treat her even though she looked well and I had no objective exam findings to explain her profound hypoxia. She received IM Epinepherine and Albuterol neb. By the time she was in ED she was satting 100% and her throat tightness resolved. So, not sure how to answer your question. Clinically I pulled the trigger and treated her for anaphylaxis following a vaccine administration. I wish it was a problem with my sat monitor but I don&#39;t believe it was. I was using a life-pack with wave form and verified with two other people that the O2 saturation function was working properly. Intuitively, it doesn&#39;t make sense but I think we should probably consider it a reaction to the vaccine. &#34;

                                                Left side stroke-like symptoms. I was walking and 20 minutes in I started having left leg weakness. This then turned into full left side numb/foggy feeling. I was with my son (and I&#39;m a nurse) so I asked him to test for signs of a stroke. I could smile evenly but it didn&#39;t feel like it. I had strength in both hands and could lift my arms. I was able to communicate what to look for to my son without slurred speech. But I was not stable on my left foot and felt as if I was listing to the left side. My left side was foggy. I moved my arm but flet it in slow motion. When I got home, I sat down and stretched. The symptoms went away and I was able to continue the day without episode. The episode lasted 20-30 minutes as I was walking home still. In hind sight, I did have a similar eposide after the first dose (Moderna lot 037K20A on 1/29/20) while exercising at home but sat down and thought it was due to a hard workout. That time it was just a weak left leg that was giving out on me and lasted 5 minutes because I stopped the workout.

Then, 9 days later my left side went numb.  My arm, leg and face went numb. 20 minutes later all feeling did come back.  I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a TIA.  I had many tests completed.  (MRI, EKG, CT SCAN, Echocardiogram)    The only thing that was found was that I have a PFO in the heart.  I am healthy, I eat great, exercise daily at the gym.  AFter an overnight hospital stay and being put on PLAVAX and aspirin my life has changed forever.  I had a doctor&#39;s appointment to discuss the PFO, a meeting with a neurologist and they are not sure why.  The paperwork shares that I had a TIA or a migraine which is not possible because I do know what migraines are like as I had these as a young child. I am now looking into closing the PFO.  I am going to get a second opinion on this based on what happened.

I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

Patient reports feeling fatigued, having cough, and feeling more short of breath for the last day, and has developed central chest pain which is pleuritic in the emergency department.  She reports that the chest pain is 4/10 in severity and does not radiate.  Her caregiver at bedside reports that the patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for the last 3 or so weeks.  Of note, she becomes dyspneic with limited exertion, such as going up a flight of stairs, at baseline.  She had a fever of 101.4 °F at home earlier today, but denies chills or diaphoresis.  He had 1 episode of nonbloody vomiting earlier today.  Denies nausea at this time.  She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday, 4 weeks after the first.   They note that approximately 5 years ago, she had a prolonged admission for which she was transferred to OHSU and was on ECMO for a time before making a nearly full recovery.  She has had the baseline dyspnea on exertion since that time.   Review of Systems  Constitutional: Positive for fever and malaise/fatigue. Negative for chills.  HENT: Negative for sore throat.

Slightly anxious appearing.  HENT: Moist mucous membranes. No posterior oropharyngeal erythema or exudates. NECK: Supple. No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic rate and regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No pain with palpation of chest wall.  PULM: Normal effort. No use of accessory muscles. Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. ABD: Soft. Non tender. Non distended.  EXT: No lower extremity edema. SKIN: No suspicious lesions noted on the exposed skin.    EKG: 04/09/21  Rhythm: Sinus tachycardia  Rate: 111  Axis: normal  Intervals: normal   Concern for possible inferior infarct noted, but felt less consistent with true ST depression  Recent Imaging: Chest x-ray, 04/09/21:  FINDINGS: LUNGS: Slightly low lung volumes.  There is hazy reticulonodular interstitial opacity seen within the left mid and both lower lung zones suspicious for interstitial pulmonary edema. CARDIAC: Slightly worsened mild cardiomegaly. MEDIASTINUM: Normal. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. LINES/TUBES: None. BONES: There is mild rightward convexity curvature of the thoracic spine along with minimal multilevel degenerative change. OTHER: Surgical clips overlie the left lung apex medially and the right upper abdominal quadrant.   IMPRESSION: 1. See above.   CT angiogram pulmonary:  FINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  -Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  Considerations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (&#34;tea and toast&#34;), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   - Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 07 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 07 Jan 2021, a few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced an anaphylactic response.

                                                Chose not to get second shot; Deep Vein Thrombosis; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning a 50 year-old, female who received Moderna (mRNA-1273) and developed deep vein thrombosis, and chose not to get second shot.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product was not provided.   On 07Jan2021 (previously reported as 16Jan2021), approximately one week prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 025L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  A week post vaccination, she had a thick painful cord down injection arm and was misdiagnosed with tendonitis. After a second opinion, she was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. On 01FEB2021, an ultrasound confirmed a blood clot and subsequently, she went to the ER. A computerized tomography (CT) of the lungs ruled out pulmonary embolism. Based on these events, the patient chose not to get the second shot.  Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.   The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the event.   The outcome of the events deep vein thrombosis and chose not to get second shot were unknown.   Follow-up information received 08Feb2021 included additional event, date of first dose was updated from 16Jan2021 to 07Jan2021, diagnostic test and treatment.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 50 year-old, female who experienced deep vein thrombosis. Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Clot blood (blood clots in heart and lungs for last 15 years) and Thrombectomy (40 clots removed from heart and lungs from past 15 years). Concurrent medical conditions included Systemic lupus erythematosus (bad lupus).    On 15-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 10-Feb-2021, the patient experienced THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced THROMBECTOMY (two clots were removed) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and LEG AMPUTATION (surgery (a leg was amputated)) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced REHABILITATION THERAPY (patient was sent to rehabilitation center). On an unknown date, the patient experienced GANGRENE (Gangrene) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION INTERRUPTED (Missed her second dose as the hospital where the patient was admitted did not have Moderna vaccine). The patient was hospitalized on 10-Feb-2021 due to THROMBOSIS, then on 27-Feb-2021 due to LEG AMPUTATION and THROMBECTOMY. The patient was treated with Surgery for Gangrene. On 01-Mar-2021, THROMBECTOMY (two clots were removed) and LEG AMPUTATION (surgery (a leg was amputated)) had resolved. At the time of the report, THROMBOSIS (Blood clots), PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION INTERRUPTED (Missed her second dose as the hospital where the patient was admitted did not have Moderna vaccine) and REHABILITATION THERAPY (patient was sent to rehabilitation center) outcome was unknown and GANGRENE (Gangrene) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   As per the patient&#39;s doctor, it was too late and dangerous to remove clots from the patient&#39;s leg and eventually, the doctor had to amputate the patient&#39;s leg because of gangrene.  No concomitant medications were reported.

                                                waited the required 15 minutes at the vaccination site.  As I was driving home, my throat swelled up, breathing was labored, and I became dizzy.  I quickly pulled over to a gas station and called 911.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported me via ambulance to the hospital.  En route, I was administered 50 mg of Benadryl.  Diagnosis was anaphylactic reaction to vaccine.

She was then transferred to Emergency Department. Per their report: The patient presents with a swollen discolored left lower leg.  She does have  discoloration and I am concerned for massive DVT and cerulea dolens.  She does  have really minimal pain to the leg except to the groin, she has intact pulses,  I have low suspicion for acute ischemia/arterial clot.  She does complain of  some mild dyspnea with exertion above baseline so I do have concerns for  possible PE.  She is hemodynamically stable, appears in no distress.  She is on  oral contraceptives, mild obesity, no other significant VTE risk factors.  I am  going to empirically start her on heparin, I have also ordered a CT PE and a CT  abdomen pelvis to check for proximal propagation of the DVT along with a left  lower extremity duplex Doppler ultrasound.    Duplex ultrasound also showed extensive left lower extremity DVT up to the  common femoral, she does have bilateral PEs without evidence of significant clot  burden or heart strain, she is hemodynamically stable with normal pulse  oximetry.  The patient also has clots proximal up to her IVC.  I discussed this  with Dr.  of vascular surgery for possible thrombolysis therapy of the  left lower extremity.  She was discussed with SOUND for admission.

It was reported to me by her immediate supervisor that she tested positive for COVID-19 the day after her first vaccination.  She became symptomatic around January 21, 2021. She was scheduled to return to work on January 29, 2021 but did not come in. She died on February 2, 2021.

She denied any rash, feeling of swelling in her throat or tongue and had no trouble breathing. Patient declined to have EMTs called because she did not feel it was anaphylaxis.  A dose of 50mg of Benadryl was via orally and she was closely monitored.  Her blood preassure was 128/84 and heart rate was 80.  She had offers to drive her to either the ER or urgent care but declined saying it was isolated to her lips and the tip of her tongue.  Patient is a nurse and was aware of what to watch for.  Pharmacy staff continued to observe her for an additional 45 minutes.  At that time she said the issues were resolving and she would like to go home.  She was counseled on what to look for with worsening reaction but said she felt more frustrated that anything.  Pharmacist encouraged her to reach out to her PCP and also explained we would be unable to give her the next shot at a clinic.  She was advised to speak more with her doctor regarding if she should get a second dose.  Patient was followed up with 2 hours after vaccination by phone and reported symptoms resolved and she was just tired from the Benadryl.  Patient was also called the day after and said she had a bad headache but otherwise no other signs of adverse reaction.

Some hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills, headache, started vomiting and my blood pressure started bottoming up that is when I was rushed to the ER. I was admitted and stayed 2 days. They said it was not related to the vaccine. First they told me it was sepsis. Then they told me it was pneumonia, not sepsis. Then said it was a bacterial infection. I sincerely do not know what I had. I am doing better now. My PCP did not recommend me to receive the second dose.

                                                a couple hours after the vaccine, I experienced a bit of rapid heart rate, which resolved after a few minutes. The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

It felt like I would stop breathing and then take 4 gasps for air, and this repeated all night and into the morning. Eventually it stopped the following day, every now and then on the following day I would repeat it but not as often.

Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma and Allergy. Concomitant products included EPINEPHRINE (EPIPEN) for Allergy, ALBUTEROL SULFATE for Asthma.    On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced the first episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced the second episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 11-Apr-2021, last episode of ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       The patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction of constricted throat, face and neck turning red, tingling and numbness in her face and throat, red bumps on her face and throat, and her face felt like it was burning. She used her EpiPen and it wasn&#39;t enough (didn&#39;t improve the reaction), so she went to the emergency room. They gave 2 prednisone tabs and prescribed prednisone and gave her IV saline and antihistamine. They released her 2 hours later. Her doctor advised her against getting the second dose. After the patient recovered from initial anaphylactic reaction on 12Mar2021, she had 2 episodes of anaphylactic reaction on 09APR2021, requiring the use of two EpiPens, Benadryl, Prednisone, and albuterol. On 10APR2021 at 0100 another anaphylactic reaction requiring EpiPen, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Albuterol. And at 4pm another anaphylactic reaction requiring Benadryl, EpiPen, and albuterol. Currently she has recovered.

                                                Patient vaccinated on 1/22.  The next morning (1/23), patient experienced diminished sensory and motor function in left arm and leg, as well as facial numbness.  Presented to the hospital on 1/24, and was found to have a small stroke in pontine medullary junction.  Discharged on 1/25.  There is some suspicion that her COVID infection in December may have precipitated this, and patient is currently being evaluated for coagulation disorders, primarily antiphospholipid antibody testing.  It is unlikely that the vaccine contributed to this, but given close timeline between the two, filing this report.

                                                vaginal bleeding.  I have not had a period in over a year and 2 days after the shot I started bleeding. After talking to others that have had the vaccine, several have had breakthrough bleeding a couple days after the vaccine and thought nothing of it, but people aren&#39;t reporting because they think its just them. I think it should be reported, and maybe some investigation  follow up as to why this may have occurred.

Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The events, sore arm, headaches, atrial fibrillation, and shortness of breath, were unknown. The event, very tired, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 54 years old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation and non-serious unexpected event of dyspnea, and non- serious expected event of injection site pain, fatigue and headache. The event of headache occurred 1 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 039K20A. The event of injection site pain occurred 2 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 039K20A. The event of atrial fibrillation, dyspnoea, and fatigue occurred 11 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 039K20A. Treatment included Cardizem drip, heparin, Xarelto and Lopressor. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This patient was at work two days after her vaccine and went to the bathroom. When she did not come back to work after around 20 minutes, she was found unresponsive and an ambulance was called. The patient was declared deceased at the  ER with the cause of death initially as cardiac arrest however a full autopsy was performed and  Coroner&#39;s office is awaiting that report at this time. We did not know of the death until we went back this week to complete the second round of vaccinations. Since the death happened in such close proximity to the vaccination date we felt it prudent to report.

                                                Woke up at 1 AM  sweaty and heard pounding. Got up and checked heart rate and it was varying 130-180 bpm. Had my husband take me to ER. They determined that I was in afib. They gave me some meds and my heart went back into rhythm after an hour or so. I had fever and headache for 3 days and then cleared up. I have had the afib episodes 2 more times since then. I had never had heart issues before getting the vaccine.

The paramedics noticed the patient was in PEA and resuscitated her and brought her to the ER. The patient appeared to have an NSTEMI and she was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism that led to the cardiac arrest event. Patient was taking to cath lab and was found to have normal coronary arteries with no evidence of coronary artery disease. Patient was also in sepsis and had an extensive bilateral pneumonia. Patient is currently inpatient and intubated.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Familial hypercholesterolemia, Peripheral arterial disease and Stent placement (has stents in her iliac ery). Concomitant products included ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM (ATORVASTATIN [ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM]), ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (BABY ASPIRIN) and SERTRALINE for an unknown indication.    On 26-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 27-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (possible stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOSIS (small clot that went through and resolved on its own) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MONOPLEGIA (Loss use of left leg/couldn&#39;t use her leg) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and PARAESTHESIA (tingling in left arm) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 27-Mar-2021 to 28-Mar-2021 due to CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT, MONOPLEGIA, PARAESTHESIA and THROMBOSIS. At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (possible stroke), THROMBOSIS (small clot that went through and resolved on its own), MONOPLEGIA (Loss use of left leg/couldn&#39;t use her leg) and PARAESTHESIA (tingling in left arm) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Computerised tomogram: Inconclusive. In March 2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: Inconclusive.   The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.  No treatment information was provided.   Patient reports an MRI and CT scan was done, and she was informed that they suspected she had a small cot that went through and resolved on its own.  Company Comment: Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However patient&#39;s hx of familial hypercholesterolemia, peripheral arterial disease and stent placement are confounding factors that may play a possible contributory role.

However the patient was diagnosed with a positive COVID-19 test on January 4, 2021.  Patient complained of nausea, vomiting, back pain, and sharp chest pain.     On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture). She was taken to the hospital that evening on February 8, 2021. Patuent experienced a second seizure while at the hospital during a CT scan. Patient later was able to come home February 11, 2021 in the afternoon. Patient now has to wear a neck brace for up to 12 weeks, cannot drive, cannot work for up to 12 weeks, and is still recovering cognitively from the concussion.

                                                Moderna #1 vaccine given at 130pm March 11th 2021. Pt had history of asthma and frequent nebulizer use and had it in car with her for drive-thru vaccine clinic we did at location, which has a large parking lot. We gave 80 doses. Pt checked off anaphylaxis on the intake form so Dr spoke to her and she changed it to no history of anaphylaxis and only has history of asthma. So we gave her the vaccine. About 5 minutes later in car parking lot she started to use her personal nebulizer. I saw her in passenger side of car using a personal nebulizer so I talked to her and her daughter to find out what was going on. They said she has exacerbations all the time and this was not out of ordinary for her. I checked pulse ox and did a lung exam, etc, and she was stable.  She seemed baseline according to history by her and her daughter.  As she seemed at baseline and clinically was comfortable and conversant whole time, and she felt better after her nebulizer, I told them to have a low threshold for going to ER or calling 911 if her asthma was worse or different than her usual symptoms.  They agreed. According to daughter, she did well until about 24 hours the next day. The daughter said she was fine and she went to store and when she returned EMTs were intubating patient and apparently the patient used her epipen and called 911 herself. Approximate time of expiration was 230pm on March12th 2021.

                                                Got her vaccine, went home and her son mentioned to her around 7:30 that her face looked strange.  He told her that it looked like Bell&#39;s palsy.  She didn&#39;t notice anything herself, but her son and husband noticed that something was wrong.  The next morning she got up and her face was swollen on the right side and she could then tell that something was different.  She went to work and the nurse at work suggested that she get it checked out.  She went to the doctor and they diagnosed her with Bell&#39;s palsy on Friday, 2/12/21.  The doctor told her to come back on Saturday to ensure that it didn&#39;t worsen, it did not change.  The doctor ordered a CAT scan and she had that done, and then she wanted to confer with another doctor she wanted her to get an MRI.  She got that done, and told her that she had a mini-stroke from the vaccine.  They initially put her on Prednisone thinking it was Bell&#39;s palsy.  Saturday evening she took her 2nd dose of that, but told her not to take it anymore as that was not the issue.   The doctors then said that they saw some pneumonia, and is being treated for that.  She goes back to see the doctor this afternoon.

                                                Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) in a 57-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 008B21-2A and 010A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Mastectomy bilateral on 20-Jan-2021 and Radiation therapy. Concurrent medical conditions included Breast cancer and Lung cancer (Has not been operated on as of yet).   On 08-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 05-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized on 10-Apr-2021 due to PULMONARY EMBOLISM. At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood Clot in the Lower Left Lung) outcome was unknown.            No concomitant medications reported.  The patient developed a blood clot in the lower left lung, and was hospitalized. The doctor told her that because of cancer, radiation and recent mastectomy surgery she was at risk of developing blood clots. Treatment medication included apixaban for six months. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Company Comment: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s underlying cancer, radiation and recent mastectomy surgery were considered to be risk factors for developing blood clots.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Arm started to feel sore as the day went on and was very sore by nighttime. Next day, arm started to feel better and over the next 3 days was no longer sore.  On the morning of the 30th, woke up feeling fine, took a 3.5 mile walk and felt fine. Around 12:30 pm, experienced sudden pain and a burning sensation in the chest and both upper arms. Thought it was possibly heartburn ; took a Prilosec. The discomfort (mild but steady) continued so checked blood pressure which was 141/91. Called cardiologist and went to emergency room per instruction, around 1:30. Admitted overnight with the diagnosis of a mild heart attack and performed a heart catheterization where they found no major blockage. One artery noted 30% blocked but that overall heart function looked good. Discharged on 12/31/2020. -reported by patient via email, on 1/3/2021 @ 4:49pm

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 04 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the right arm for COVID-19 infection.  On an unspecified date, a few days after vaccination administration, the patient experienced red rash around the injection site which was tender and itchy and was diagnosed by a nurse as cellulitis, which later resolved.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient began coughing.   On 18 Jan 2021, the patient went to urgent care for a COVID-19 test and the results came back negative. The patient was prescribed dexamethasone for three days, but symptoms did not improve. She again went to urgent care where X-rays was performed which showed pneumonia and partial left lung collapse, she was prescribed erythromycin.   On 24 Jan 2021, patient went to emergency room and was given amoxicillin and advised to see their doctor.   On 27 Jan 2021, her doctor prescribed prednisone and the symptoms started to get better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported, although the patient expressed concern about getting the second injection.  The outcome of events, cough, pneumonia, and partial left lung collapse (pneumothorax), was reported and resolving. The event, injection site cellulitis, red rash around injection site which was tender and itchy, was reported as resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the report lacks critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications.  Noting that cellulitis and pneumonia are usually caused by an infectious agent, both events are considered unlikely associated with mRNA-1273. Pneumothorax is confounded by the pneumonia.

I went back on 20th - and they did x-rays - I had pneumonia and a partial lung collapse. On the 20th, They put me on antibiotics and an inhaler. On the 24th I went back to ER, I wasn&#39;t any better. They put me on a different antibiotic. On the 27th, I went back to the doctor  - because I was still coughing really bad and they put me on a different steroid. I was back to work on February 1st. I still have a cough - it hasn&#39;t ever gone away.  I still have to use the inhaler. I never had a cough before this and haventh had to use  inhaler.

Went home and within another 20 minutes had completely lost voice.  Went back to Urgent Care.  Was told again to keep an eye on it or go to ER.  They didn&#39;t even look at me.  My own Doctor was down the street so I went right to her office.  My doctor was not in, so another doctor came right out to look at me.  She checked my breathing and it was okay but I could not speak at all.  She put me on prednisone and Benadryl for several days.  Eventually felt better after meds.  Made appointment with allergist, for follow-up.   He said it was an anaphylaxis reaction.  Was told to not get second dose of Moderna shot. I have since had the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/30/2021 with no immediate adverse reaction, just side effects (chills, severe headache, fatigue, sore arm).

                                                Vaccine induced pancytopenia /  thrombocytopenia - STILL ONGOING WITH TREATMENT.  My mom felt very tired the 2nd day after the vaccine; blood taken ~5 days after vaccination showed lower HgB count (8.8 from her normal range of 11&#43;). She remained at home for recovery and then consulted a hematologist. During this period she still felt extremely tired / dizzy / headaches / couldn&#39;t walk up the stairs without breath. 13 days later - more blood sample was taken and now she is diagnosed with pancytopenia - lowered count of RBC (it down further), HgB (down further to 7.1), and Platelets (down to 80 from ~170 her first blood sample). And she was hospitalized. They gave her Prednisone, and a blood transfusion at the hospital. During this first stay - her RBC / HgB and Platelets seemed to have stablized and went higher but they didn&#39;t pay attention to her WBC - which went down to 2 (below normal range). A day later during follow up around WBC - it went lower to ~1.2 (her platelets ~117). She developed a fever - now it is considered a neutropenic fever and she was hospitalized once again (platelets was back down to 84 at the beginning of her stay). During this past week in the hospital, they gave her meds to induce WBC growth - which worked but it overshot to 12 (above normal range) and at the same time her platelets and RBC and HgB dipped again lower. Platelets dipped to 43 on Saturday along with HgB down to  7.1 after 2 days of sustained high WBC count so they gave her IVIG and another blood transfusion. After that, her WBC dropped a little further and is stabilizing around 6 along with HgB around ~10. However her platelets remain high volatile - it went to 51 on Sunday, dropped to 46 on Monday, and now it is 38 today. She was discharged from the hospital today and we have a standing order to have her blood tested everyday.

Just before 11am we received a call from the patient&#39;s roommate that the patient arrived home and collapsed, it was also mentioned her blood pressure was high. We explained that they needed to call 911 but the patient did not want to go to the hospital. We explained that this patient must go to the hospital and get evaluated. They did end up calling 911.  Approximately 45 minutes later I received another call from the patient&#39;s roommate that EMS did not believe this was a reaction from the vaccine. The roommate mentioned that she was in fact mistaken about the blood pressure and it was actually low (92/54 mmHg). She also mentioned that the patient was vomiting.   Around 1:45pm I received a call from the roommate to tell me that the patient had died.

Pt was monitored for vaccine reaction with no known adverse reaction. Approximately  18 hours post-vaccine, she was found deceased in her sleep at 0540 on 2/20/21. Per circumstances/pt history, it is presumed that the patient aspirated while sleeping, perhaps secondary to a seizure. Coroner was notified and declined as coroner&#39;s case. VAERS notification being made due to pt death within 24 hours of receiving a vaccine.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction. Shot given around 9am. Around 11am symptoms appeared: extremely hot/flushed, nauseated, felt ill, difficulty swallowing. Went to pharmacist who had me sit down, within 30 seconds could not swallow. Pharmacist injected me with Epi Pen and called 911. Paramedics arrived gave more epinephrine, oxygen, started breathing treatment. Lost my voice as throat started to tighten more. Taken to Hospital where I was given Benadryl, steroids, stomach meds, more fluids and another breathing treatment since my lungs were so tight, I could only take shallow breaths. The crated my lungs, did blood work and kept me overnight for observation because I have a history of secondary reactions when I experience anaphylaxis. I was released from the hospital on 2/20/2021 at 2pm.

I fainted and cut my forehead in the fall.  I was shaking uncontrollably following this.  My husband bandaged my forehead and checked me for a concussion.  Sometime after 2am I realized I was in atrial fibrillation.  I have a Kardia app that confirmed this.  I tried at home methods to go back in rhythm.  At 8am I called my cardiologist.  He advised me to go to the emergency room.  At this time the Kardia app indicated I was no longer in Afib but still had a fast heartbeat.  At the emergency room I had a normal EKG, CAT scan, blood work and chest X-ray and went home about 11am.

She even looked like she was gasping for air. An epipen was administered and within seconds she was able to breathe. 911 was contacted upon initiation of the reaction. EMS arrived within minutes after administering the epipen. She was assessed by paramedics and it was determined that the patient would be ok. I called husband in the afternoon to check on patient and he stated that she was good. I also followed up on 03/05/2021 with the patient and she stated that other than soreness that she was fine. I let patient know that since she had a reaction to the first dose, that she would not be able to receive the second dose.

                                                My reaction after the shot was mild, slight headache and fatigue. 2.5 weeks post vaccine I had a Grand Mal Seizure. I don&#39;t know whether or not it is related but I had a seizure 30 years ago and no problems since that time so it made me wonder whether or not it was a result of the vaccine.
