Presented to ED with newly diagnosed AML, in MDS with WBC counts ~250, 000.    He had a normal (EX ANEMIA) CBC on Jan-21. He had COVID vaccine #1 on Jan-25.  About 4-days later he developed diffuse dermititis and severe fatigue. He had an  ED visit on Feb-8 for these issues and was prescribed Prednisone and Cefalexin  (completed Feb-15).  CBC was NOT done at that ED visit. He called HEME clininc  on Feb-16 (see also the Hematology Note) stating that he was just NOT feeling  well in general with increased fatigue and DOE. He noted that the dermatitis was  mostly resolved. We rechecked CBC on Feb-17 (results available about 4-PM) that  indicated ACUTE LEUKEMIA.  Presents to the MC with MDS on FEB18.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.   On 15JAN2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly (Lot number: 026L20A). On 16JAN2021, the patient noted a start date for Pneumonia.  On 10FEB2021, the patient called the medical information call center and reported, &#34;he is on antibiotics for pneumonia. His 2nd question is can he delay the 2nd dose since he is suffering from pneumonia. Patient was administered 1st dose of vaccine on 15/Jan/2021 in his left non dominant arm. The lot# was provided, but expiration date is unknown. Patient experienced some expected side effects, which he is not concerned about&#34;.  The event(s) were arm swollen, tired, achy, lingering shortness of breath, muscle weakness in the injection arm, and tested positive for pneumonia 1 day after receiving the vaccine.  The action taken for Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) Vaccine was reported by the patient as Tylenol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the events of fatigue, arm swelling, myalgia, muscle weakness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the event of Pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related. Further information has been requested.

                                                Approximately two weeks after receiving my first dose of the vaccine, I started experiencing upper body bilateral joint pain, primarily in shoulders and wrists.  This pain has continued since then for approximately six weeks now.  In addition, my right arm, hand, and fingers are swollen, and the tips of my fingers on the right hand feel slightly numb. I have been taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen, but still have the symptoms described above.

                                                Approximately 8 hrs after the second Moderna vaccination I starting having chills. These continued and increased in intensity along with the onset of fever. I did not have an accurate means of taking my temperature at the time. Over the course of the night on the 17th/18th of February the chills and fever never subsided, even with two doses of Tylenol. The day of the 18th, fever and chills continued along with a feeling of intense malaise. My sternum was very sore and it hurt to breathe as a result of the prolonged shivering. I had no appetite and ate absolutely nothing the day of the 18th. In the early morning hours of the 19th my fever broke as did the chills. However, later in the day, a thermometer was obtained and my fever was 101.4 degrees. When taken at bedtime, it was down the 99 degrees and returned to normal later with no future spikes. On the morning of the 20th when I awoke, I noticed a stinging soreness in my mouth and lip area, followed later in the day with my nostrils and inner nose. This turned out to be an intense outbreak of Herpes. The roof of my mouth, gums, upper surface of my tongue, lips, nostrils, and inner nose ultimately became covered and extremely painful. These lesions were not typical blebs, but were tiny, albeit most painful. After five days they resolved and I have had no further issues. As a possible area to investigate - I had had the second Shingles booster 14 days prior to my first Moderna COVID vaccination. I understand Shingles is also a Herpes family virus.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

                                                Patient had a sore arm on the evening of vaccination.  The next morning at 8am he had a fever of 103 degrees, violent shaking, and his lips were numb.  He was transported by ambulance to the ER and admitted.  He received IV therapy and acetaminophen.  He states he vomited February 4th.  An X-ray was performed on his abdomen and he was given a diagnosis of Ileus.  The next day, February 5th, he was able to have a BM and eat.  After he was able to eat, he was released from the hospital.  Shortly after being released from the hospital his lips started breaking out in fever blisters.  He estimates he had 50 or so cold sores and his lips were extremely swollen and red.  After seeing his regular health care provider, he started a round of Valcyclovir.  On February 10th, the date he reported the adverse reaction, he stated his lips were getting better and he still had more Valcyclovir to take.

At first, he looked like he was having a vasovagal/ syncopal episode: he became non-responsive, stared straight ahead.  then shortly thereafter he started to take be gasps for air, his lips turned blue.  It soon became clear that he was having an anaphylactic reaction. we called for an ambulance,  we administered one dose of an Epipen, and administered oxygen. His pulse ox was in the low 80&#39;s.   within a minute or two, he started to react and started to moan, breathe more normally, then began to speak to us.  His BP was checked and was 118/83.  His oxygen sat went up to 100%. after a few minutes,  We took the oxygen off and his sats dropped into the 80&#39;s so we restarted the oxygen.  We are rural, so it took the ambulance 30 minutes to arrive. He was very stable at the time that he was  taken to an emergency room for further evaluation.

                                                I had Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on Wednesday February 3 at 11:30 AM . After the vaccine I went home and had virtually no pain. Around 10PM that night I felt some pain in the toes on my left foot. When I looked, I noticed that my toes were red and appeared slightly swollen.   My big toe was the worst. It was sensitive to the touch and very red. I also felt a short intermittent sharp pain that would last a second or two. It would happen every 3-4 minutes. The next day the redness was gone on all but my big toe.  As I write this today Saturday February 6 at at 11 AM. My big toe is still sore, but does appear a bit better.   I have had gout once in the past. So, gout or Covid ?   The people at were great.

From ER MDs note: EKG was normal sinus rhythm, narrow QRS, delayed transition, minimal lateral st depression V4. Patient IV access on arrival, would Brady down to the 40s 1 time as low as 27 but remained alert, blood pressure is not dip.  Troponin was mildly elevated and decision was made to transfer the patient.  Prior to transfer is necessary to rule out pulmonary embolism, intracranial injury Patient wished to proceed with CT angio chest and noncontrast CT of head which were without acute findings.  Patient given aspirin 81 mg to supplement the 81 mg he had earlier today.  Discussed with hospitalist, patient was accepted in transfer. Suspect this is combination of patient&#39;s beta blockade with underlying sinus node dysfunction.  Patient does have prominent lower extremity swelling and suspect pulmonary hypertension despite treatment with CPAP but cannot exclude valvular heart disease.  Patient was went to Hospital.  Symptoms thought to be unlikely from seizure.  Doubt CVA, ongoing cardiac ischemia.

He was initially tachycardic, febrile and had leukocytosis 18K, with admission labs with creatinine 1.8, lactate 2.4. He had need for supplemental oxygen and was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Respiratory viral panel including SARS COV2 PCR was neg. Blood cultures from 2/24, 2/27, 3/3 were negative. CT chest showed some prominent mediastinal adenopathy which was increased from prior CT 2017. Also had axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2/27 he had a code blue called for bradycardia in context of receiving ativan for a CT study. Antibiotics  were changed to Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, acyclovir on 2/28. Multiple attempts by multiple providers at doing a lumbar puncture have been unsuccessful.  Bronchoscopy 3/2 with left lower lobe secretions. Cultures negative. He has stayed incessantly febrile and working diagnosis is probable underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm immunostimulated by vaccine. At this time a bone marrow and lymph node excisional biopsy is planned. Patient is unstable to proceed for MRI imaging at this time due to hypotension.

By 8:00pm I began to feel weak, tired and poorly. By 11:pm I had developed a fever and aches and pains in most joints and muscles which mimicked flu symptons. During the night I became chilled and found it hard to sleep from all of the discomfort. Most of these symptons were almost gone by the next night except for the swelling, which took another 2 days to go down. I have had no other symptons since then.

This spontaneous case was reported by a physician assistant (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of RASH (rash from the elbows to the wrists in both arms) in a 79-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 004M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history reported. ). Concomitant products included SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) for an unknown indication.    On 01-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 11-Feb-2021, the patient experienced RASH (rash from the elbows to the wrists in both arms) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PERIPHERAL SWELLING (Moderna arm) and RASH MACULAR (a very red splotch that was 4x3inches for the first 3 days but know it has been spreading reaching). At the time of the report, RASH (rash from the elbows to the wrists in both arms), PERIPHERAL SWELLING (Moderna arm) and RASH MACULAR (a very red splotch that was 4x3inches for the first 3 days but know it has been spreading reaching) outcome was unknown.

                                                About 4 days after the second dose my lymph nodes near the injection site started to hurt. Over the next few days the pain got worse so that I couldn&#39;t lie on that side of my body. The symptoms progressed towards my shoulder and neck and other lymph nodes became painful. The next phase a few days later was red spots and blisters around the injection site on my chest near my neck on my left side. At the present time the blisters have mostly gone away but they&#39;ve been replaced by welts where the red spots were these are swollen and red. All of these symptoms are accompanied by fatigue and muscle pain also around my left shoulder. I have been treating it for the past 3 days with ice and am now taking an antihistamine Benadryl.

He was admitted 12/25 with hypogycemia and mild weakness and sent home He was given his first dose of the Moderna vaccine 1/4/21 at approximately 9AM covid vaccine clinic He developed weakness the next day  (1/5) prompting admission to a hospital and then transition to subacute rehabilitation briefly  Work up at hospital revealed progressive respiratory failure and pneumonia requiring intubation and progressive ascending weakness and sensory loss without upper motor neuron changes.  MRI : nerve root enhancement LP : protein 40, &#43;/- 80 lymphocytes, cultures negative B 12 and B6 normal extensive CSF testing still pending campylobacter and Musk antibodies negative Neurology diagnosed likely AIDP (Guillain-Barre) and an EMG is planned for the near future.  Neurology felt the cause of his GBS was likely his covid infection verses his Moderna vaccination He was treated with plasmapheresis.  Client received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and zosyn and doxycycline when progressive leukocytosis and procalcitonin elevation was noted. Candida was cultured from tracheal aspirates but felt most likely d/t colonization with an option to treat further if he did not continue to improve. He is now extubated, unable to swallow and has profound weakness and distal sensory loss. He will transition to Acute rehab in the near future.  Comorbidities:as described in the above section and... DM2, CKD3, HTN, DJD, BPH ( h/o prostate surgery), h/o Lumbar surgery and hernia repair, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia.  Possible etiologies of his AIDP ( GBS)  would include his recent covid infection, the Moderna Vaccine, or other undiagnosed infection. He got his flu shot 9/25 ( fluzone sanofi) so this is not likely to be the culprit

                                                Around 4:30am on the day after administration of the vaccination, patient went into ventricular tachycardia and his ICD attempted anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). Per electrophysiology note after interrogation of patient&#39;s ICD: &#34;Multiple VT episodes beginning around 4:30 AM, and continuing intermittently through 10:15 AM, approximately. There were 19 treated VT episodes, mostly terminated with ATP therapy. There was a single 24J shock delivered at 9:43 AM after a VT episode lasting 1 min, 4 seconds, with average ventricular rate 171 bpm. This appeared to be an appropriate shock after exhausting 8 ATP attempts. On 5 other occasions the patient required 4 or more ATP sequences to terminate VT. The remainder terminated with 1-2 ATPs. Reviewing the far field electrograms, there appear to be 2 distinct VT morphologies. Average ventricular rates for both are about 170-180 bpm.&#34;  Patient presented to the emergency room, where he received amiodarone IV, and was admitted to an inpatient cardiology service. He was restarted on amiodarone and was noted to be hemodynamically stable and not in VT; however, he opted to leave the hospital AMA on 3/15. As noted previously (item 11), he has a history of VT and had discontinued amiodarone due to side effects about 6 weeks prior to this episode. As amiodarone has a half-life of around 45 days, it is thought that his rhythm control was suboptimal at the time of this vaccination, and there is no evidence that it was the vaccination that caused the VT episodes on 3/14.

                                                On 02/17/2021, patient received the second dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine in the left arm. Approximately 3 days post-administration, patient developed pain, swelling and erythema of the shoulder extending to the posterior/proximal anterior sections of the arm. Patient was unable to move arm due to swelling and presented to the Medical Center Emergency Department on 02/22/2021. A CT of the extremities revealed cellulitis, myositis, and possible fasciitis without abscesses. Subsequent MRI found myositis and cellulitis without evidence of osteomyelitis. Patient began to develop erthematous blotches and an Infectious disease consult was placed. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin). After cultures were obtained, patient was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. Two sets of blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics and a left arm swab showed no growth (finalized). On 02/26/2021 patient underwent incision and debridement of left arm with findings of edematous soft tissue without abscess or necrosis. On 02/28/2021 all antibiotics were discontinued per Infectious Disease provider due to lack of concern for infection.

                                                Close to &#34;urea sepsis&#34;; severe UTI; A spontaneous report  was received from consumer concerning a 82-years old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced severe UTI/urinary tract infection and close to urea sepsis/sepsis.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications was not provided by the reporter.  On 16-Feb-2021, the patient received second of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number: 006M20A) in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 16 Feb 2021, the patient developed a severe UTI. Close to urea sepsis. Took antibiotics.  Treatment medication included antibiotics.  No lab tests were mentioned.  The events severe UTI and close to urea sepsis were considered to be serious with criteria of important medical event.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events severe UTI and close to urea sepsis was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded

PTA bowel obstruction led to a syncopal episode following use of laxative, and several episodes of vomiting in the days prior . Upon admission Patient was receiving conservative therapy for a partial obstruction when he developed increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory status and eventually developed significant hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Neurology was consulted for altered mentation in the setting of respiratory failure. Patient with ascending paralysis. MRI of the head and neck as well as CTA were obtained x2. Patient was ultimately diagnosed with Guillain-Barre, variant and received 5 days of Intravenous Immune Globulin therapy.  Patient&#39;s small bowel obstruction resolved and ultimately patient required percutaneous tracheostomy tube and gastrostomy tube placement for prolonged respiratory failure and neurologic compromise.  The patient had uneventful ventilatory requirements and ultimately was performing intermittent spontaneous breathing trials; however, still had episodes of apnea, but improved.  He was tolerating tube feeds at goal with resolution of his small bowel obstruction, which was thought secondary to his Guillain-Barre.  The patient did develop abnormal LFTs which were thought secondary to cholecystitis not requiring operative intervention, with improving LFT findings on antibiotics.  The patient had a nonobstructive cholecystitis.  The patient&#39;s mentation was improving to the point where he was able to communicate and open his eyes upon discharge, as well as was working with Physical Therapy for strengthening.  He was able to move his upper extremities and followed commands and lower extremities were improving in strength as well. Patient was discharged via private air flight to acute care ICU facility.

                                                Admission Note: ? Weakness - Generalized     Patient reports feeling weak prior to dialysis, but demanded clinic to perform dialysis. Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.

En route while in ambulance, he experienced a convulsion with rhythmic shaking in all limbs lasting several seconds.  He had a second episode requiring midazolam and levetiracetam. On arrival to MGH ED, the patient was afebrile, heart rate 133, blood pressure 173/93, oxygen saturation 99% on a nonrebreather.  He was found to be severely encephalopathic, mute, and not answering questions or following commands.  He was admitted to the neuroICU and intubated for airway protection given his poor mental status. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of meningoencephalitis, but these were discontinued after his CSF was not concerning for a bacterial infection herpes simplex encephalitis.  Antibiotics were discontinued. He was extubated on hospital day 2.  After extubation he had persistent mixed receptive-expressive aphasia that was slowly improving over time. At discharge from the hospital, he was able to occasionally say a simple sentence, could repeat simple phrases, and could follow simple commands. He was discharged to Rehab

                                                Patient has long standing COPD and asthma. He has been stable on his home medications for years. No hospitalizations for these issues in the past. During Covid times he has been very restricted to his home with no visitors. Approximately 5 days after receiving the 2nd Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, he started having increased difficulty with breathing. Over the next few weeks he continued to get worse and required home oxygen and an adjustment with his medications. He was started on steroids and antibiotics about 3 weeks after the vaccine and then hospitalized on 3/16/2021 with COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. He tested negative for Covid at that time. He was in the hospital for 9 days and discharged home on steroid taper and home oxygen. A few days after being at home, he had gradual onset of subacute dementia/delirium. All workup has been negative. MRI/MRA normal. He is currently continuing on oxygen and again on steroids and mental status may be starting to improve.     The concern here is that patient was stable and had been stable on his medication regimen for years. He was doing well until approx 5 days after his second Covid vaccine when he started having worsening pulmonary complaints and eventually ended up in the hospital. He continues to be on oxygen at home and was recently started back on steroids. There has been no explanation for his subacute onset of Dementia/Delirium. MRI/MRA normal. This has been discussed with both Pulmonology and Neurology specialists.

                                                fluid overload; fatigue; Swollen lymph nodes; This spontaneous case was reported by a physician (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of FLUID OVERLOAD (fluid overload) in an 86-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Co-suspect product included non-company product IBRUTINIB (IMBRUVICA) tablet for Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.    Concurrent medical conditions included Allergic reaction to drug, Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Blood pressure high, Swollen lymph nodes, Swelling, Fatigue, Allergy to chemicals and Fruit allergy (Cantaloupes). Concomitant products included ATENOLOL for Blood pressure high, COENZYME Q10 [UBIDECARENONE], TURMERIC [CURCUMA LONGA RHIZOME], SELENIUM, VITAMIN D3, VITAMIN B COMPLEX, CALCIUM and FISH OIL for Supplementation therapy.   On 10-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 11-Mar-2021, the patient started IBRUTINIB (IMBRUVICA) (Oral) 420 milligram once a day. On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 11-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LYMPHADENOPATHY (Swollen lymph nodes). On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FLUID OVERLOAD (fluid overload) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Apr-2021 to 05-Apr-2021 due to FLUID OVERLOAD. At the time of the report, FLUID OVERLOAD (fluid overload) was resolving and LYMPHADENOPATHY (Swollen lymph nodes) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, Weight: 182 pounds 182 Pounds. On an unknown date, Weight: 194 pounds 194 Pounds.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The reporter stated, the patient had been taking Imbruvica for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia for almost one month, but he complained that the drug had not helped to reduce the swelling, which might be caused by swollen lymph nodes. The swelling started before he started to take Imbruvica. The patient also said that the Imbruvica had not helped with his fatigue. He emphasized that he had no side effects from Imbruvica. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient was hospitalized for fluid overload, and 4.9 liters of fluid was removed from his body. He was discharged on 05-Apr-2021 to go home with a prescription of furosemide, to be taken orally daily, for the treatment of fluid overload. When he was admitted to the hospital, he weighed 194 pounds. When he was discharged from the hospital, he weighed 182 pounds. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. The chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a cofounder; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.
