Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                The shot was administered in my left arm.  I experienced localized swelling and axillary lymph node tenderness immediately after injection under my left armpit.  The right side of my face also became numb for about 5 minutes.  The next morning the areas around my eyes were swollen and I had two styes in my right eye.  I do not know if these were related.  These symptoms lasted approximately 3 days.  Some minimal swelling and tenderness seemed to remain, and approximately a week later I experienced a painful resurgence of the swelling at the injection site that was far larger, harder and more painful.  I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen.  These relieved the symptoms within 48 hours.

Approximately 48 hours later (evening 01/14/2021) started to notice increased inflammation about the size of a &#34;quarter&#34; on left side of chin. I did have a pimple/ingrown hair at this site prior to the injection which was mostly healed but not entirely healed. The next morning, 01/15/2021, I experience mild facial numbness to the left side of my chin and mild facial paralysis resulting in an asymmetrical smile, and mild swelling to the left side of my face. Two day later (morning 01/17/2021) with my symptoms not worsening but showing only a little improvement, I went to my local urgent care for evaluation. Provider was not 100% sure of the diagnosis but felt this could be a case of shingles or folliculitis. I was treated with a 7 day course of acyclovir and a 10 day course of doxycycline hyclate. The numbness subsided 2-3 days after treatment began. The facial paralysis and swelling showed much improvement (90-95%) after completing the acyclovir on 01/24/2021; however, I feel there is still a little more improvement to go.

Then one week later on 1/26/2021 I started having vaccine shoulder itchiness I didn&#39;t think anything of it and then my arm swelled and got hot. The next day on 1/27/2021 it had a red area around it and was hot. I have never had a fever or anything else except minor pain the day after the vaccine.  I continued ibuprofen and benadryl at night it took the itch away and was bearable. I want to know if I should get the second shot? I have it scheduled for 2-15-2021 @ 2:00 pm PST I also have pictures

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

He has never had them before, since the vaccine he had swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under the chin, and head. His skin has felt itchy and burns a times. Three days ago his skin hurt to touch and last night on April 25 he started getting a rash under his arm. This morning it had spread across his back and chest. We went to the Doctor and he was diagnosed with shingles.

                                                Entire left arm, all the way from shoulder to the fingers swelled up to 1.5 times the normal size. The left index figure and thumb started tingling and became numb. The pain is present in the front and back of the left shoulder as well. Saw a Dr and she told me to take 4 x 200mg Motrin every 6hrs for next 4-5 days. She also gave Tylenol 3. The pain was so acute that I asked my doctor to just chop off my arm. I couldn&#39;t sleep, I couldn&#39;t stand, sit or lay down. It hurt all the time. Lost all strength in the left hand and arm.  Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help with the pain. The swelling went down quite a bit in 3 days. Motrin caused a flare up of Crohn&#39;s.   Saw another Dr 5 days later. She prescribed gebapentin, flexrel, norco, toradol, etc. It&#39;s now been almost 20 days since the injection. The pain has subsided but not completely gone. I am still unable to do much work and it hurts just to sit! I still have pain and still do not have my strength back. I am still unable to go back to work.

I experienced no pain throughout the entire event, only felt tightness in skin on calf from swelling.   Bilateral ultrasound performed &amp; results negative for DVT in both legs. Final Dx is Superficial Thrombophlebitis. Treatment plan is to elevate affected left leg &amp; apply warm compress when possible &amp; wear compression stockings when standing for extended periods.

My tongue also felt slightly swollen and a little bit of dry mouth.  symptoms disappeared   By the next day.

                                                It was the Moderna Vaccine. I had a prescheduled meeting to get some tests done on the Monday, following my vaccine (02/22/2021). The results of those labs showed a severe inflammatory response. My blood platelet levels were at 27, and my CRP was at 15. I started bruising easily, which I have never done before, and I had serious body aches and fatigue. I met with Dr.  on Tuesday, March 16, 2021 to do some follow up tests. At this point, my platelet levels were up to 96, much improved, but still low. He said that it could very likely be connected to the vaccine. I had the first dose on January 23, 2021, and the second dose on February 20, 2021. I now have to get additional tests to see if these levels improve.

                                                After my first dose vaccine, I developed two large lymph nodes in the sub clavicular aspect of my clavicle, left side.  I went to see my surgeon who palpated them and said that they would go down in one or two weeks.  These lymph nodes are still present today and I am concerned because I do not know when they will go away.

He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

                                                Approximately 54 hours after receiving shot I noticed a couple hives on the lower portion of my body.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and went to bed around 10pm.  I woke up around 1am on 3/20 and noticed that my lips were very swollen and I had several hives on the lower half of my body.  Additionally my scrotum was enlarged.  Other than the physical symptoms I felt fine - no fever, body aches, pain, or respiratory issues.  I decided to go back to bed after taking 2 Advil.  I woke up at 7am and was still having a reaction so I decided to go to the ER.  While at the ER the gave me steroid and Benadryl which immediately started working to reduce the reaction.  They took blood work which came back &#34;essentially perfect&#34; according to the Dr.  I was discharged and prescribed an epipen, and a steroid which i took for two days.  I was instructed to follow up with my primary care physician which I did on 3/26.  The ER Dr believed that my reaction was caused by something that i had ate; however, to the best of my knowledge, I am NOT allergic to any foods.  Shortly before the reaction I had eaten a can of ravioli and some bread.  The can from a 12 pack that we bought at the grocery store approximately 6 months ago.  It as the last can in the pack and I did not have a reaction to any of the previous cans.  I met with my family Dr&#39;s PA the following week and she indicated that while there is no way to know with 100% confidence that the reaction was from the shot, she noted that it was highly unlikely that my reaction was from the ravioli can.  The PA informed me that I needed to use extra caution should I decide to get the second shot.  I am scheduled to receive the second shot on 4/14.

                                                ~12-18 hours after injection pt began to feel itchy with steadily worsened over the next ~36 hours.  At that point he began to have angioedema and bilateral hand swelling  and large generalized wheals. He never had difficulty breathing or swallowing. He was seen by another provider and given a solu-medrol injection followed by high, tapered dose of prednisone.   3 days after treatment pt returned to clinic and was seen by me. Swelling has resolved though he continues to have generalized urticaria. He is taking his prescription as instructed. No difficulty breathing or swallowing. Pt instructed to keep cool, continue his medication, and to f/u immediately for any worsening symptoms or concerns.

                                                Had a slight fever that developed overnight, aches at lymph nodes and fatigue.  Felt normal but tired at about 11am.  Also the expected arm soreness at the injection site.  I had the same symptoms with the first shot but more intense and lasting all the next day.  For the first shot I had just gotten over a cold earlier that week.  Also on the second shot I made a point of drinking a lot of Gatorade the night of the injection and another the morning after. Otherwise I did things about the same for both.

My entire left arm was swollen TWICE its normal size. The injection site was extremely tender to the touch. I could barely use my arm. I had to assist that arm with my other arm. I was extremely lethargic/tired/fatigued. So much that I was in bed 95% of that 24-36 hour time frame; unconscious!!! I was having sporadic &#34;head changes&#34; all day. I was very scared and worried!!! I was unable to perform task at home as well as was unable to work!!!

Went for a run to get the body moving and  try and hopefully reduce the swelling. However, this instead resulted in an inflammatory reaction in the toe joints of the left foot (and to a lesser degree in the right foot) that has persisted to the present day of May 16th - almost 2 months. The inflammation may be slowly receding, but exercise rapidly brings it back.

                                                Starting about 2-3 weeks after my 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID19 vaccine, I started experiencing daily joint/nerve pain and swelling.  It affects different parts of my body each day, but the usual targets are my fingers, wrists, knees, and ankles.  Sometimes, it is a pure nerve pain.  Other times, it is paired with swelling, especially in the knees and fingers.  I&#39;ve experienced pain like this in the past, but very infrequently (once every few months at the most).  But the pain has been on a daily basis ever since late-March/early-April and still persists today.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

Symptoms after 2nd shot01/19/2021 - slight fatigue recovered after 24 hours.  4 days after 2nd shot - Developed cold sore on lower lip area. To my recollection, I have never had a cold sore before which is a bit concerning. I understand that I may contracted HSV-1 and not have know it as child. I am curious if somehow the COVID vaccine somehow compromised immune system to a degree that the HSV-1 is now active? May very well not classify as an &#34;adverse event,&#34; but since I haven&#39;t heard of any such issues I thought I should report.

I had it checked out at the walk in clinic and they said it was an allergic reaction and to take Benadryl along with icing the arm.  I was not the best at following this but once I started doing this is started to get better and was cleared up within a week.

                                                I received my first dose of the COVID vaccine on January 12, 2021.  I had a headache on the night of Jan 15 so took two Tylenol pills.  I woke up with a worse headache so took two Excedrin Migraine pills in the morning.  At about 10 am I started a 10 mile run, which is not unusually long for me.  I finished before noon and when I urinated , it was almost all blood, which has never happened to me before.  I went to the emergency room.  They gave me IV fluids and took some blood tests.  My creatinine levels were abnormally high but the doctor felt I overexerted myself and was too dehydrated even though the workout was not unusually for me.  On January 18th, I developed a quite painful lump in my left armpit, that lasted about a week.  I saw my primary care physician on Jan 23rd for a follow up.  He thought the lump was a swollen lymph node from the vaccine and was not concerned.  He scheduled blood tests and an ultrasound of my kidneys, all of which came back normal. I received my second vaccine shot on Feb 9th.  I developed a headache that night and have had a headache most of the time since.  I have taken several pills of Excedrin Migraine over these few days.  I also traveled to San Diego on the 10th and did a fairly long and arduous hike up a mountain on the 11th.  Although it was intense, it?s the type of hike I do several times a year and not completely out of the ordinary.  I was also a bit dehydrated again.  I woke early morning on the 12th with another headache so I took two more Excedrin MIgraines and went back to bed.  When I awoke about 6am, I urinated blood again.  I urinated blood for several hours and have finally drank enough water to end the blood urination. I normally work out intensely several times a week and do have bouts of dehydration.  But I have never urinated blood before.  I can?t help but believe it?s no coincidence that the two times in my life I?ve urinated blood have coincided with COVID vaccine shots.  Not sure how my exercises, dehydration, and use of NSAIDs  have contributed but something is going on and it needs to be investigated.

I went in the ambulance they brought me to the emergency room where they gave me Benadryl a steroid and some IV fluids. as soon as I receive the Benadryl my throat started to open up and my lips both started to go down . My lip continue to swell for the next three days on and off often on. Every time it swelled up I took Benadryl and every time sure enough it went away . The day I came home from the hospital I thought I was doing much better until that following night I became severely nauseous. I don?t know if it was something that they had given me in the hospital or still a reaction that was going on in my body, but I had some sort of stomach bug I threw up that whole day, had chills sweats  and a pounding headache that would not go away for over 48 hours .I was unable to eat or drink for 24 hours and had to go to an urgent care where they provided me with some medication for nausea. My concern right now is I am hearing that the second shot hits a lot harder than the first one and if this was a reaction to the shot I am very afraid of what will go on if I get the second one.  I cannot take a chance with my life.  I really want to shot I work in an environment where I am working with the department  which is why I was able to get the vaccine so early I feel safe being vaccinated I am very disappointed that this happened I just cannot take a chance having a family etc. Also I have very bad medical in Sherance so I am dealing with all of the bills from this hospital stay I have a  deductible which I can?t afford and then only 50% is covered afterwards. That is the reason I do not go to the hospital under no circumstance unless I am dying which that night I was that scared I felt the need I had to go.

Around the seventh day I had chills and night sweats, and severe aches and pains and lethargy. Around this time I started to notice swollen lymph nodes throughout my body ? five around my head and ears and three in the groin area.  I also found lumps in my neck and rib cage, though I?m not sure if these are lymph nodes. Three weeks later the lymph node swelling has diminished, but they haven?t disappeared entirely.

                                                Shortly after the 2nd shot, at the 24hr mark, I felt the normal vaccine symptoms: swelling, joint aches, headache. I got over that in a week. Simultaneously, I had an acute flareup of my gout. I thought it was just joint pain, but when the normal symptoms went away, I realized the joint pain in my legs was still present. I haven&#39;t had a gout flare up in 2 years. The pain was the worse I have ever experienced. Within 5 days, I contacted a doctor. I was given a colchicine prescription. A week later, the gout cleared up. The weird thing is I feel like it is coming and going. It is unusual because when I have a gout attack, it is something that comes and leaves for about a year. Now, the gout is coming and going which is concerning to me because I have been taking care of it and it has been under control for some time now.

After the patient showed me the swelling, I suggested that they be evaluated at clinic care or the ER if unable to contact their PCP.  In the meantime,  I recommended that he take Benadryl and ice the affected area.

It kind of leveled out but stayed numb all of work. I was still swollen after work.   Woke up on Sunday and my arm was hurting bad. numbness had dissipated.   ate then suddenly felt flush and hot. fetal position on the bed for a half hour then I had to drag myself to work. felt bad the first few hours but as the night went on I felt better.   I could always feel it behind my eyes. early on it felt like I was discharging a bunch of stuff from them. My body was literally numb on the left half. I could feel the middle of myself from my scalp to my toes.

It is similar to the reaction I have to penicillin. It happens sometimes when I?m ill with a flu or cold, but I?m not sure if the reaction is due to the illness or OTC or prescription medication. I?m not concerned for my health. I just wanted to report the reaction.

I was worried about getting second dose then I noticed that people had this as a common side effect on their collar bone. I was very sleepy the day after the shot and very foggy.  I didn&#39;t wake up until 10 AM and then worked until about 1230 PM then went and laid back down. It wasn&#39;t for several days until I noticed the lump on my collar bone.

This began to radiate pain outwards and upwards over the course of few days. By the fourth day, the pain and swelling had spread to entire jawline and neck, right side. Visit to ER confirmed periodontal abscesses, in total 3. After one week of antibiotic, symptoms returned with greater pain, spreading back to entire right neck and jawline into right ear. As of this writing, it has been 19 days since the second Moderna shot and the lymph nodes in the entirety of my right side hurt.

                                                ANAPHYLAXIS: Pt received his second Moderna COVID19 shot on 12Apr2021 at approximately 2:30pm. He waited the required 20 minutes to check for any adverse reaction and then left the facility to drive home. On his drive home, at approximately 3:30pm, he started feeling light headed and lost consciousness, striking a telephone pole. He was gasping and struggling to breathe, so the ambulance treated him with oxygen. When he arrived at the ER , the doctor assessed his condition and confirmed that he was experiencing an anaphylactic reaction related to the COVID vaccine and treated him with an epinephrine injection, steroids, benadryl, and nebulized albuterol.to open his airways. He remained at the ER for ~ 6 hours for observation until his blood oxygen levels increased and he was stable to be released. The car accident resulted in PT suffering a fractured sternum as confirmed via Chest CT Scan by his primary doctor. PT has no history of any allergic reaction to any medication or vaccine. Although he does have well-regulated asthma, this incident was not characteristic of any asthma-related reaction he has ever experienced.

Severe pain when touched,  and slowly backing off after full 48 hours. It?s been 10 days and Left arm shoulder has about 85% mobility. Swelling in armpit also still present but almost gone.  I have a lock jaw kind of sensation still lingering as well.  No infection detected at injection point. Worried for dose two.

                                                Swelling inside collar bone area on side of injection. Possibly lymph node. First time noticing swelling is approximately 7 days after 1st injection.  Over the next 3 weeks, swelling decreased to almost normal until 2nd dose.  After that, swelling was noticed approximately 48 hours later and correlated vaccine with swelling. Between the 1st and 2nd dose, I visited MD, Physical Therapists, Massage therapist.  Other symptoms included popping of collar bone when shrugging shoulder.

                                                He says he got his second COVID shot (Moderna) on Saturday and says his lymph nodes in his neck and armpits got swollen and sore which was similar to when he once got bit by a black widow. His energy has been low, and he has been feeling dizzy with a fever on Sunday and Monday. He has not been able to go back to work since the shot. He says that on Sunday he wasn&#39;t able to get out of bed. He got the shot because his mother&#39;s nursing home required it in order for him to see his mother.

                                                Patient  developed episode of diarrhea shortly after 1st shot in series,  this was followed by  lower extremity swelling and mild dyspnea on exertion, that quickly exacerbated after the 2nd shot on 5/15/2021,  that resulted in severe dyspnea on exertion, severe lower extremity swelling with approximately 25 lb weight gain, orthopnea and hemoptysis. Patient reported temperatures of 99.2 F to 99.8 F.   Outside CT chest abdomen pelvis angiogram showed moderate to large acute segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli with trace right heart strain and right lower lobe pulmonary infarction, moderate right pleural effusion, acute splenic vein thrombosis with extension to the proximal portal vein and associated splenic infarcts, bilateral renal infarcts, and evidence of portal hypertension. He was transferred to the Hospital for further management. Upon presentation here he was tachycardic but with stable blood pressures and requiring up to 5 L by nasal cannula. Initial laboratory studies were notable for WBC 21.0, INR 1.8, D-dimer 11653, NT pro-BNP 17684, troponins 603 to 579 to 574, CRP 127. He was started on a heparin infusion. He was admitted to the MICU for further management.   Bedside ultrasound demonstrated reduced biventricular contractility. He was given two doses of 40 mg intravenous furosemide with about 3.5 L of urine output since admission (net negative 3.1 L). His oxygen was weaned to 1 L by nasal cannula. Lower extremity venous and arterial Dopplers were negative.  Subsequent imaging  demonstrated a transperineal inferior infarct with akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior and inferior lateral walls with apical and mid ventricle akinesis secondary to a complete occluded RCA.  moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade noted.  Upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated acute DVT in the lower right IJ, innominate, subclavian and proximal axillary veins.  MRI  venogram was negative for clots, but multiple acute and subacute enhancing infarcts within all 3 vasculature distributions consistent with embolic etiology were noted.  TTE showed of mural thrombus along the septal and inferior walls of the LV apex,  severely enlarged left ventricle with EF of 20%, severe hypokinesis.    Patient was aggressively IV diuresis, with improvement in respiratory status.  Maintained on  high-intensity heparin for pulmonary emboli, DVT, and diffuse arterial and venous thrombosis.  He was bridged to warfarin.  Patient was  prescribed LifeVest for primary prevention. Started on beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor given EF.     Patient planning on discharge 6/5-6/07, outcome pending.

                                                Nearly two weeks after injection, I now have a 4 inch diameter circle of redness with slight swelling and itchy.  I noticed it after showering two days ago.  It almost looks like a localized allergic reaction but it did not appear until 2 weeks after the shot.  It is slightly warmer to touch than the rest of the area but it is not painful at all.  I had similar markings plus moderate pain around the injection site1-2 days after the shot but they quickly dissipated.  I am not sure if this should be reportable or not but I was a little concerned considering the amount of time that has passed since the shot and considering I am due for my second shot in a couple of weeks.

                                                I didn&#39;t have any adverse affects until 5 days after I received the vaccination. Early in the afternoon on Wednesday 1/20 I noticed that my lymph nodes in the armpit of my left arm and on the left side of my neck were swollen and sore. This worsened as the day went on. I also noticed a pimple had formed and came to a head in the exact spot of where the needle stick had been. It &#34;popped&#34; that day and a small amount material came out. My lymph nodes have remained sore and swollen since 1/20. On the 7th day after (1/22) I noticed a couple of smaller, dime sized red blotches/rash on my left shoulder and left side of my neck. I also noticed that the injection site on my left shoulder was sore, swollen and hot to touch. On the 8th day (1/23) I noticed that there were more of these dime sized red blotches/rash across both shoulders, my back and a small area in the center of my chest.  It continues to be like that as of today (1/25). On the 9th day, (1/24) starting just after noon, I began to feel poorly. Achy and just generally not very good. I had a few bouts of diarrhea throughout the afternoon. I also had a pretty strong headache when I awoke on the morning of the 24th. Today, (1/25) I awoke again with a headache although it was not as sore as yesterday. I don&#39;t feel great today, but I do feel better than I did yesterday. The rash looks the same and my lymph nodes seem to be slightly less swollen and less sore.

In the course of trying to bring warmth to the body, I showered and ended up having severe vomiting. The body aches, fatigue, and overall sickness stayed with me for over 48 hours. Two days post vaccination, my left arm was swollen with severe redness. I am still struggling with fatigue and body aches (4 days later) but have regained mobility and strength.

Pt showed photos of lip swelling, and he reported it to his health care provider.  His health care provider sent an email that recommended not receiving the second dose of Moderna. However,  pt was automatically scheduled from his first visit to get second dose, and pt showed up to site to discuss it and showed this vaccinator the email and photos and described this course. This vaccinator did not administer second dose of vaccine and recommended discussing alternatives with MD.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

                                                I have not been sick all year.  About 12 hours after the shot, I had a fever, extreme pain and moderate swelling in left arm.  Nausea.  24 hours after vomited.  Extreme fatigue, slept 13 hours straight. 48 hours still fever and fatigue but improving. 72 hours, fever and nausea gone, but still fatigued.    96 hours later felt completely fine. .....   But here is where I find it very strange.  At 120 hours after, my 10 year old daughter develops the exact same systems.   She DID NOT receive any vaccination.  She develop a fever and vomitted approimately according to the same time frame I did.   I find this extremely strange considering we have been very viligant about wearing masks outside our home.    We asked around and we do not know of anyone who has had the flu nor come in contact with someone who had the flu.  I find it extremely bizarre that my whole family has not been sick all year and then 12 hours after I get the vaccine, I get sick and throw up and 4 days later my daughter also gets sick and throws up.    From what I understand, this might just be a bad coincidence, but I felt I needed to report it.  Thank you.

Muscle soreness when I raised my arm above my shoulder. If I was going to examine someone for a rotator cuff injury - with the arm above that is where the soreness was. Nurse practitioner took picture of my hand that first day and the next day Dr looked at it. I had these symptoms for two weeks. My fingers are still kind of sore now. I had to try a few things to get the ring off my finger but otherwise no treatment.

On Friday, I feel little gland swelling on right side neck and on Saturday the swelling is bit more prominent. While swallowing food and drinking water, I am feeling awkward in neck.

                                                Night of 2nd vaccine woke up with a high fever, and severe headache. Fever lasted 36 hours and peaked at 104.8 (with Tylenol).  Fever was over 103 degrees for majority of 24 hour period. Fever went away after 36 hours.  However, headaches have continued constantly (17 days and counting).    Went to the Dr. on 2/19/21.  They wanted an CT Scan of head and sinuses.  Dr. Prescribed cefuroxime 250 MG tablet in case of sinus infection and ibuprofen 800 MG tablets.  Insurance did not approve a STAT CT Scan, so Dr. told me to go to the ER if headache persisted.  Went to the ER on  2/23/21.  Dr&#39;s indicated Blood pressure was very high (180/120).  I do not have a history of high blood pressure.  They did a CT scan (normal) EKG (normal), and blood work.  They inserted an IV with migraine cocktail to alleviate headache.  Unfortunately no change.  While in the ER they gave me:  - Sodium Chloride - Tylenol - Metoclopramide (injection) - DiphenhydrAMINE (Benedryl) (injection) - Dexamethsone  - Ketorolac (Toradol)  They prescribed methylprednisolone (steroid).  Went back to primary doctor on 2/25.  Blood pressure remains high (average 158/112 throughout the day), headaches continue (constant).  They did more blood work, urine sample, and another EKG.   They also ordered a STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM.  The prescribed lisinopril 10 MG tablet for blood pressure.

Concurrent medical conditions included Penicillin allergy (Not sure about the allergy).    On 15-Apr-2021 at 1:52 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 15-Apr-2021 at 2:22 PM, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty in breathing) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required), SWELLING FACE (Swelling of face) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required) and SWOLLEN TONGUE (Swelling of face and tongue) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required). At the time of the report, DYSPNOEA (Difficulty in breathing), SWELLING FACE (Swelling of face) and SWOLLEN TONGUE (Swelling of face and tongue) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   EpiPen and 50 mg of Benadryl were given intramuscularly as a treatment for the events. 9-1-1 was called for further evaluation. No information on concomitant medications.

The main, additional side effect I want to report is lymph-node shooting pains under my right armpit and throughout my right arm and forearm that occurred on 2/11 and 2/12 (one and two days after). Three days after the shot, I noticed slight lymph node shooting pain on my right jaw, under ear.   I?ll be getting the second shot...it beats COVID-19 by at least a mile!

Less than 24 hours later developed chills, sweat, aches and pain.  By 30 hours after the injection I developed pain in my lower back that spread to my right ground.  In 48 hours I was now experience excruciating  pain in my groin with a constant and intolerable pain down my leg into the knee area which continued for hours.  I was unable to find a position of comfort and was taken to the ER .  I was immediately given a morphine drip which was not successful and then administered Dilaudid for the pain which was able to calm it down but not end it.  At the time of this writing (About 72 hours after 2nd injection) I am unable to stand or walk without pain in my groin and knee area.  Part of my thigh and Knee are have developed numbness and extreme discomfort.  I can finally only sit with much pain.  This Moderna Vaccine was administered through my employer.

                                                On the evening of 04/01/2021 I noticed a sudden itching sensation in my right arm and when I scratched it discovered the area to be swollen.  Upon self examination I found the area be swollen in a disc shape approx 3 inches across and 1/2 to 3/4 inches deep. It is feverish to the touch.  This is a sudden presentation.  The area was not swollen or feverish earlier in the day.  An online searh found tht &#39;Covid arm&#39; seems to describe the symptoms and I intend to take Tylenol if necessary.

                                                patient self reported tetracycline allergy that resulted in difficulty breathing and hives.  Reaction happened many years ago. I asked patient to wait an additional 10 minutes for a total of 25 minutes so we could keep him under observation.  After his 25 minutes patient reported that his fingers felt swollen and he had taken his wedding ring off to show me.  Patient also reported that his lips felt &#34;tingly&#34;.  I observed the patient and noted no flushing, no sweating, no rapid pulse.  I took the patients blood pressure and it was 121/80.  I gave the patient Benadryl  and asked him to wait for another 15 minutes so I could observe him.  After the 15 minutes I observed the patient again and he still had no flushing or swelling and he reported that he no longer felt &#34;tingly&#34; and felt fine.

                                                He got the vaccine, started to get the headache within 45 minutes, ran some errands and after a couple of hours he felt like something was burning on his buttock, and noticed a really bad red rash on the left side on the left cheek from the crack outward. It was extremely hot to the touch and very sore, kind of throbbing and swollen and progressively got worse. He was just not feeling well, nauseous and dizzy and went to sleep but when he woke up it had spread to the other cheek. It looks like he got burned or scalded red/purple in color. He has no reaction on the arm itself, but only on the buttock and a blistery, blood red, leathery feeling rash/blotch on his entire buttock to both hips on both sides. It is difficult for him to sit. He also had headache, the muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea.  He did not vomit but had not eaten anything. He has had a high fever up to 103 until this morning 4/8/21 which is about 99-100.  He woke up soaking wet today. He has not been able to turn his neck, and not able to lift his arm above his waist level since the vaccine, and not able to turn his neck to the left at all. He can turn it 5-10 degrees, but right is okay. He took some Benadryl over the last 2 days for the reaction but it has not. He also has taken aspirin/Aleve for the fever. He was so sock and had no energy and could not sleep but could not keep his eyes open either, was not able to open them. He did write his doctor when the rash was only on one side, which they did not give him any advice as he was not feeling any worse at that time. He was at 101 fever throughout the day and then at night went to 102. He was hoping that the rash would be better, but actually worse as described above. He has not had any appetite, trying to drink fluids but made him nauseous, and he normally drinks water all day long. His normal temp is 97.7. He has been taking showers to try and keep his fevers down and the water hitting the rash feels like somebody is pouring scolding water on it. He did call Moderna on 4/6/21 asking if this was a reaction that anybody has reported, and he is waiting for somebody to call him back.

I will say that I am not sure this is related to the shot but wanted to report it as it is different from any other skin reactions I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s been three weeks now and it still itches and burns as much as it did three weeks ago.  I have tried applying Triamcinolone Acetonide .1% steroid cream which does help.  I have also tried antibiotic ointment covered by bandages overnight (no effect), Eucerin (no effect), and Aquaphor (no effect).

Was just reading about COVID-Arm, and it sounds like the same thing.  While it&#39;s only been 7 days since my first shot, I&#39;m going to continue to monitor, apply ice, and use Benadryl as needed, and if it doesn&#39;t go away in another week, will schedule a doctors appointment to be safe.

                                                Patient got his Covid vaccine this past Thursday, 2 days ago.  He experienced typical side effects of a sore left shoulder and some fatigue but was feeling well until this afternoon around 1:55 PM when he noticed throbbing of his left hand.  He looked down and noticed that there was a purple discoloration to his middle finger and distal palmar aspect of his hand.  He felt like there was maybe some swelling as well and that he might have been having an allergic reaction so called the emergency department for further advice and came in for evaluation.  By the time I arrived to the emergency department the patient&#39;s left hand was no longer swollen and there was only a small purple discoloration to the palmar proximal middle finger.  I was concerned that the patient developed a small blood clot that was resolved upon evaluation.

                                                About 24 hours after receiving vaccine, noticed very slight pain and small blistering in right cheek  area on face.   Did not think too much of it at first, however the area grew a little and swelled up.  Consulted with my doctor and they diagnosed Shingles.  Am currently prescribed Valtrex for shingles.

                                                Noticed severe pain in right hand and wrist two days after receiving vaccine. I then began to have severe pain in both shoulders, both knees, both hips, and both elbows. The pain started on 4/10/2021, and became very severe over the course of that week. The pain started to lessen starting the week of 4/2/2021 and has seemed to improve but the right shoulder still has shooting pains when moved certain ways. My right hand is still swollen and I  cannot make a full fist. I am unable to fully bend my knees. My left elbow still has shooting pains when moved into certain positions

I had a loss of appetite, nausea, and no energy.  My fever lasted for approximately 30 hours before subsiding.  I alternated Tylenol and Alieve during my time with fever.  On Sunday, February 7, I began having mouth sores and fever blister on my lips.  For this, I used Lysine, both tablet and lip ointment.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

When that pain subsided during the second day after the shot, I started to get some swelling and pain in my left armpit. Discomfort was such that it interfered with my ability to sleep through that night. The following day (Day 3 after injection) the discomfort mostly subsided but still has not completely gone away. Currently on Day 6 after injection. No treatments or medications have been applied to alleviate the issue.

Left arm is still painful and with reduced strength as of 4/28/2021. States arm is still swollen but has improved. Patient saw his primary care provider (not at our clinic) on 4/23/2021 and was given a shot of Toradol for pain. Patient also kept existing appointments with neurosurgery and pain management for failed back surgery. Neurosurgeon advised it could be nerve injury and that it will heal over time. Told patient that nerve in arm could be in a different location due to his history as a body builder. Patient states arm is better but still painful and weak.

                                                On 4/13 Patient underwent aortic root replacement with saphenous vein graft reconstruction of the right coronary artery. He had no prior coronary disease. This operation was done for an enlarging aortic root aneurysm in the setting of Marfan syndrome. The right coronary was anomalous and needed vein extension for reimplantation. He recovered very well and was seen in our clinic on 4/23, with no unusual findings. He had a normal echo, EKG and DVT study performed.   On 4/28 he had his first Moderna COVID19 dose. on 5/1, he developed malaise, myalgias, painful lymph nodes, chills, and chest pain. He called my clinic and was instructed to go to the ER, but then felt better and didn&#39;t go. He was then found unresponsive later that afternoon and was pronounced dead on arrival of EMS.

                                                I had no noticeable issues with my first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. I had the following issues after my second dose (April 29, 2021):  Day 2 (April 30), 28 hours following injection, I experienced an internal feeling of ?jitteriness?, shortness of breath, and accelerated pulse. Pulse oximeter showed my oxygen saturation dropped to 92 percent (my normal is 98-99) and my resting pulse rate increased to 120 bpm (my normal varies from 66 to 75). Aforementioned symptoms subsided after 6 hours.  Day 3 (May 1) following injection, local swelling and pain in muscle at site of injection (upper left arm). Arm swelling and pain subsided by Day 7.) Day 4 (May 4), noticed two swollen lymph nodes (size of pea and small marble) near collar bone area of neck (same side as injection).  Day 31 (May 29), both lymph node swellings still exists (as of this reporting) though not as prominent.

Called 911 and paramedic took EKG and informed me I was having a heart attack on the way to the hospital.  Once at the hospital they measured my TnT-Gen5 and the baseline was 2658 ng/L with another test taken an hour later showing 2873 ng/L which led to additional tests listed in box 19.  Final diagnosis was perimyocarditis and I received a prescription of Colchicine 0.6 MG to be taken twice a day for 6 weeks and then follow up with a cardiologist.

                                                One week after 2nd dose noticed left ankle and calf area swollen much larger than right ankle.  Slight pain and tightness in left upper chest, upper back, and into left arm occurring often.  Symptoms have persisted for over a month.  Was checked for a blood clot in left leg but results were negative.  Seeing my doctor for additional tests, probably an echo next.  Symptoms have persisted daily since about one week after the 2nd dose.  Concerned symptoms are consistent with myocarditis.

Peaked with chills and sweats 16 hours post injections.  Fatigue for the next two days.  Cold sore appeared 2 days post injection. Tinnitus noticed  (double pre-existing tinnitus levels) 20 hours post injection.  Tinitus still present over 30 days later. Checked permanent damage box because I have no way to know if the tinnitus will subside.  The tinnitus is what reminded me/prompted me to submit this.

                                                I began with chills on Weds. morning around 10am that only got worse not matter what I did. My arm continued to hurt but I thought it was just the injection pain. I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit. Dr. feels this was and allergic reaction and recommends I do not get the second injection.

I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

                                                The second evening after having my 2nd Moderna dose my left arm completely froze up. I was only able to lift my arm above my head with assistance from my right arm. Eventually I was able to lift my arm without assistance and the same phenomena happened the third evening where my shoulder was frozen and immobilized.  The frozen shoulder has abated but there is still moving poi&#39;s of major swelling in the upper arm. There has been persistent but slowly abating symptoms of deep soreness, arm weakness and weak grip strength. Swelling persists in the upper front portion of left shoulder. I can not do extended tasks with the arm because it does not have strength nor stamina.

                                                I experienced &#34;Moderna Arm&#34; on the day following the injection, but it subsided after a couple of days. Eight days later, though, it returned (swelling/redness/milder pain) -- accompanied by swelling in my right ankle and tightness/some tingling/mild pain in my right ankle/upper calf. I suffered a blood clot for the first time in each leg in early November; the more serious of the two was in the vicinity of my upper calf in my right leg. In December, I began to experience sensations in my right ankle that were similar (albeit more intense) to what I later experienced after my vaccine; the post-vaccination symptom in my right calf was also similar (but milder) to what I had experienced from the DVT.

Throughout the second day, I experienced headache and fatigue that did not alleviate until the morning of the third day.  After the headache and fatigue alleviated, I noticed a large swollen gland under the left armpit.  This slowly diminished over time and was mostly gone by the fourth morning.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving vaccine I broke out in a cold sweat and was dizzy. That lasted for about ten minutes. The next day I woke up to pain running from the right side of my jaw to my right ear. The injection site in my right arm was more sore than any other vaccine shot I have ever had. The glands in my neck were swollen and my right side shoulder and neck area were sore. I experienced waves of fatigue over the next four days. The pain to my ear that seemed to mimic a really bad ear infection continued for six days. I went to the minute clinic at the Pharmacy where I received the shot and was checked out. There was nothing wrong with my ear and they could not find anything wrong with me other than my glands were swollen and I had a general amount of swelling on the right side of my next going into my shoulder. While the pain in my ear has lessened some it is still there now eight days after the vaccination. I have also experienced some GI issues. I am extremely regular and do not have issue going to the bathroom. My gut was not normal and I did not have normal bowl movements for more than a week. I also have had something akin to a rash on my arms that looks like prickly heat. It seemed to me that my immune system overreacted to the vaccine. I have contended for months now that I had Covid back in March of 2020 right before the shutdown. I believe I caught it during business travel at the very beginning of March 2020. My concern is whether I should get the second Moderna shot if my immune system is already this revved up with antibodies.

I took ibuprofen for pain and continued to work Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  I came home Saturday night around 8pm.  I could barely walk the pain  was so bad.  Took my boot off and saw that the redness was spreading to the top of my foot towards my ankle. My wife took me to the ER. I was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescribed Cephalexin 500mg 4 times a day for 10 days. The infection resolved after finishing the antibiotic.

This subsided and then on day 3 he developed severe substernal chest pain and came to ER where his hs-cTnI was &gt; 2000 ng/L and peaked at 6700 ng/L.  His ECG, echo and cardiac cath were normal but MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular dysfunction. He is doing well clinically and we are managing expectantly.   This appears to be immune mediated myocarditis from the Moderna vaccine

Symptoms began to improve at 36 hour mark. 72 hours after injections only symptom that remains is lymph node inflammation.

Seen 9 days after vaccine administration, he has inflammatory polyarthritis, with R hand significantly swollen, L hand mildly so; bilateral shoulder pain with decreased ROM, bilateral hip pain and spine pain.  saying he can feel every joint - difficult to move around (unusual for this 52 yo male).    He increased his ibuprofen to 800 TID and increased his tylenol to 1 g TID without relief.  Pt was given a shot of steroids (SoluMedrol) on 2/27 with some improvement by 3/1, but not completed resolution of swelling, grip strength or pain.

                                                About 4 hours following the 1st part of the vaccination (i.e. around 8:30 pm), I felt the skin of both my cheeckbones swelling and flaring up. By the following morning, I felt that skin area, as well as the area around both of my eyes to feel as if I had sustained second degree burns. Additionally, the skin around my eyes particularly, presented with extreme dryness and geriatric symptoms, such as wrinkling and streched thinned skin, as if I were an elderly person (over 75 years old, and not 52).  The flaring/burning subsided after 4-5 days. However, the skin dryness around the eyes has persisted to this day (i.e. 5 weeks past the 1st vaccination). A day after the 2nd part of the vaccination, I felt moderate dizziness and headache, which lasted for about 24 hours. Also, light soreness and skin stiffening were experienced at the arm location where the shot was adminmistered.

                                                No reaction to first shot. Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

                                                54 days after the first vaccination with Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine, and 25 days after the second vaccination, at approximately 0730 on Day 1, a 52 year old male, height 175.2cm, weight 95.5kg, without significant medical history or prodrome, had an acute onset of dyspnea manifesting as a small sigh at intervals of 4-6 minutes, which increased in frequency to intervals of 2-3 minutes over the course of the day. At approximately 1400 he had a one minute episode of tachycardia &gt;120 bpm. At 1515, his forehead became diaphoretic. He had neither chest pain nor a pericardial friction rub at any time. He went directly to the local emergency department. Additional information for Item 18:   Blood pressure at admission was 155/87, pulse 97, respiratory rate 22/minute, SpO2 98%, and Temperature 37.2. ECG at 1539 interpreted as: &#34;NSR at 85, Lateral ST depressions; ST elevations in aVR, ischemia / Posterior wall MI&#34;.  ECG at 1541 showed: NSR at 82, unchanged from prior ECG. ECG at 1552 interpreted as: &#34;Sinus tachycardia at 102, ST depressions remain in lateral leads but now also in V3 and V4; persistent ST elevations in aVR CW evolving posterior wall MI&#34;. PR depression in leads II and V4-6, and reciprocal PR segment elevation in aVR (pericarditis ECG Stage 1) Atypically for pericarditis, ST depression, rather than ST elevation, was present in leads V3-V6.  Owing to a working diagnosis of an evolving posterior wall myocardial infarction,  an emergent cardiac catheterization was performed, which demonstrated non-obstructive CAD and a small myocardial bridge. Initial laboratory values were notable for a white blood cell count of 11.89 K/mm3 (4.5 - 11.5), monocytes 1.1 K/mm3 (0.0 -1.0), 9.4% (2.0 - 9.0),  neutrophils 7.9 K/mm3 (1.5 - 6.6), 66.9% (40.0 - 75.0). Troponin was negative at admission and 18 hours later. D-Dimer was negative. Viral panels including SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV were negative. He was admitted for overnight observation. On Day 2 an echocardiogram was normal with no effusion, and ECG was notable for the absence of PR depression and persistent ST depression in leads (PR segment normalization part of pericarditis ECG Stage 2)... His dyspnea persisted, with a moderate sigh every 1-2 minutes at rest. He was discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of coronary vasospasm or a pulmonary etiology, and told to follow up with his pmd. Over the next several days, his dyspnea was continuous and progressively worsened, and he had diaphoresis of the forehead every morning approximately 0900 until Day 20. Sleep remained normal. On Day 5 he was sighing deeply more than once per minute at rest, causing him distress, and ECG showed (?persistent ST depression in V4-6 with reciprocal changes in aVR). On Day 12, ECG showed T-wave inversion in V1-6 and ST depression in V3-6 (ECG Stage 3); a computed tomography of the chest was normal; and blood tests notable for normal monocyte count .57 K/microliter (0.0 - 0.8), normal CRP 2.15 (1.0-3.0), and an ANA titer of 1:80 (elevated) described as a speckled pattern, which is associated with several autoimmune diseases. Repeat echocardiography on Day 26 showed a small, generalized pericardial effusion and was otherwise normal. Cardiac MRI on Day 29 showed delayed gadolinium uptake. Pulmonary function tests on Day 38 were normal. Stress echocardiography on Day 44 was normal. Cardiac CT angiogram on Day 46was normal. The patient was diagnosed with pericarditis of unknown origin and started on aspirin 650 mg p.o. b.i.d. An ECG on Day 80 showed PR depression in II and V4-6, continued ST depression in II and V3-6, without T wave inversion (T wave normalization c/w ECG Stage 4). Symptoms progressively worsened from onset to nadir around Day 12, on which he had continuous moderate dyspnea upon awakening with severe dyspnea with mild exertion. Symptoms then generally improved until after Day 47, he began to have alternating periods of several days without symptoms followed by several days of  mild dyspnea.  Clinical symptoms resolved on Day 85.

                                                a 52 y.o. male sent for evaluation due to symptoms which have now lasted for months and began occurring shortly after he received his second Materna vaccine.  He had his first Madrona vaccine on 3/26/2021, and his second vaccine on 4/23/2021.  Initially he noted headaches, neuralgia, chills and sweats, and just suspected these would dissipate as had been described in the media.  His headaches and neuralgia did resolve, but he continued to have significant night sweats and fatigue.  He had one episode where he passed out and struck his head.  This has not recurred for over a month.  He has had 2 episodes of vomiting bilious material these were significantly spread out.  He has noted a 20 pound weight loss and difficulty sleeping.  He does report that in the last few days his symptoms seem to have improved, and his appetite has improved as well, but he has not noticed any weight gain yet.  He did have low-grade fevers the highest being in the 101 range.  He had no visual, taste, pulmonary, genitourinary, rheumatological, or dermatological complaints.  Apart from the 2 episodes of vomiting he has had no GI issues.  His wife is present and concurs with his history.  He has had a significant work-up from his primary care provider who included an LDH in late May that was normal, CBC with differential which was benign, a Monospot which was negative, CRP that was elevated at 85 with 0-10 being the reference range, a negative ANA, negative RA, and a sedimentation rate of 42, blood cultures were performed and were negative.  Labs earlier in the month noted similar findings.  His basic metabolic panel and liver enzymes were also normal.  He was also reportedly screened for Lyme and was negative but I do not see this test result.   He denies any childhood infections of significance. The also went to a safari in 2019.  They traveled recently prior to the onset of his symptoms but he reports no known bites or scratches by ticks, insects, mosquitoes, or other animals.  No one else in the household has been sick.  He did receive the BCG vaccine as a child.  They also report a chest x-ray was performed and was benign.  He was given a 10-day course of amoxicillin and reports no significant improvement while on this.

The next day his symptoms got worse so he took Benadryl since he thought he was having an allergic reaction but he continued to get worse.  The third day his speech was getting worse, his face continued to swell and droop and he still had severe headache on the left side.  Pt ended up going to the ER where they did a CT, EKG, Chest X-Ray, blood work, gave him IV fluids and steroids. The ER Dr. consulted a Neurologist which told him he had the symptoms of Bell Palsy so they did the stroke protocol but ended up telling him his symptoms were from taking the Covid Vaccine.   He was told to finish his medicine that they prescribed which is steroid and antibiotic and if he did not get any better to come back for FU.

The fact that they appeared 6 days after the vaccination was administered was interesting to me.

He reported the symptoms were since approx the 5/17/21. Pt said it possibly started sooner on the 15th. Pt came in  today 5/21/21 because he received an ultrasound at a clinic by referral from his pmd and was dx with a DVT to the left calf. His pmd then referred him to come to ER where I triaged him in the triage department. He mentioned that began feeling bad after the Moderna Shot he received on 4/28/2020 and stated the now he has this new problem that he never had in the past. Only hx was mild htn he said.

Significant swelling of tongue where I couldn&#39;t close my mouth. I also  had a sore throat with pustules that were treated with antibiotics as well as swollen glands in my throat. Very similar to my symptoms from when I had COVID back in March 2020.  I was prescribed antibiotics for the swollen tongue and pustules.

                                                Patient manifested with flu-like symptoms (myalgias, fatigue, cough, abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath) with high-grade fevers (TMax 103F) approximately 4-6 hours following administration of 2nd Moderna vaccine on 5/4/2021 per patient&#39;s wife. The symptoms progressively worsened to the point that he presented to an outside hospital on 5/12/2021 at which time he was found to be tachycardic and febrile (T 103.1F). Labs at that time were notable for significant thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate, elevated procalcitonin. Chest imaging showed bilateral airspace disease. CT of the abdomen noted hepatosplenomegaly with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. He was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Labs on 5/13/2021 were notable for a markedly elevated ferritin level, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, elevated CRP, elevated transaminase levels, hyperbilirubinemia, markedly elevated CXCL-9 level, markedly elevated IL-18 level, normal natural killer cell function. Of note, while his blood and urine cultures were negative, he was found to have elevated EBV viral load on peripheral blood draw. He had a bone marrow biopsy which reportedly showed rare evidence of cells with what appeared to be erythrocytes within their cytoplasm, concerning for HLH.  Given strong clinical and serological suspicion for HLH, he was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of care. Upon transfer to our facility on 5/18/2021, his inflammatory markers were persistently elevated. He unfortunately developed worsened renal and respiratory failure, and required both hemodialysis and intubation respectively. He was continued on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, however we additionally initiated high-dose steroids as well as anakinra for treatment of HLH. Given EBV viremia, we also began rituximab therapy. He was successfully extubated, however as of 5/26/2021 remains dialysis-dependent with continued improvement in urinary output. His post-intubation course has been complicated by encephalopathy of unknown etiology. We have consulted infectious disease to proceed with a diagnostic lumbar puncture to ascertain potential CNS pathogens explaining the cause of his altered mental status. MRI of the brain showed no evidence of pathology. CNS involvement by HLH remains on our differential.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Obesity.   On 16-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 15-May-2021 at 2:00 PM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 15-May-2021, the patient experienced ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), DYSPNOEA (Stuggling to breathe) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (Struggling to walk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). In May 2021, the patient experienced SEPSIS (Acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), CARDIAC FAILURE ACUTE (Acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), CARDIAC ARREST (Cardiac arrest) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), INFECTION (Blood infection) and PYREXIA (Fever). On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (Seizures) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and THROMBOSIS (Bood clots) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 15-May-2021 to 25-May-2021 due to DYSPNOEA, GAIT DISTURBANCE, SEIZURE and THROMBOSIS. The patient died on 25-May-2021. The reported cause of death was Cardiac arrest, Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, ards and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the time of death, SEIZURE (Seizures), THROMBOSIS (Bood clots), DYSPNOEA (Stuggling to breathe), GAIT DISTURBANCE (Struggling to walk), INFECTION (Blood infection) and PYREXIA (Fever) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-May-2021, Blood pressure measurement: elevated (High) Twice normal. On 15-May-2021, Glycosylated haemoglobin: elevated (High) High. On 15-May-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Required intubation and was placed on ventilator.. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: negative (Negative) 1 negative COVID antibody test. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negatie (Negative) 3 negative COVID antigen tests.         No concomitant medications were provided.  It was reported that within few hours after second dose of vaccine patient was struggling to walk and to breathe. The reporter and her husband went to see the patient and took him to an emergency room (ER). In the ER his blood pressure was markedly elevated (twice normal) and his oxygen level was low and by midnight he required intubation and was placed on a ventilator. His HbgA1c was noted to be elevated. Two days after admission (17-May-2021), he developed seizures which the medical team believed to be due to blood clots and he was anti-coagulated. It was determined that he did not have blood clots on his heart valves as the source of the clots. The source of the blood clots was never identified. He later developed fever and was diagnosed with a blood infection and treated with antibiotics. At one point his oxygen requirement on the ventilator went down to 65% but later returned and remained at 100%. He ultimately died on 25-May-2021 and as per copy of his death certificate he had 4 causes of death as cardiac arrest, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis.  Treatment included, anticoagulants, antibiotics, intubation and ventilator.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-219410 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Cardiac arrest; Acute hypoxic respiratory failure; ARDS; Acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis

This was very uncharacteristic.  The abnormal EKG triggered a nuclear stress test and echocardiogram, conducted several weeks later.  All normal.  I&#39;m fit and active for may age and in otherwise good health.  I had an additional issue on the same date as the abnormal EKG.  Foot pain and swelling in the right foot, and four weeks later, the left foot.  The rheumatologist&#39;s diagnosis is gout with appropriate treatment plan, but tests are inconclusive.

                                                Initially there was soreness at injection site which lasted about a week, lessening with each day. I was incredibly fatigued for about three days after. Also, the entire right forearm felt sore for about a week, as well. The day after vaccine shot, my right testes was achey and sore (and still is uncomfortable) Also, the top side of my right foot was very tender. During the course of the week, that part of my foot became lightly swollen as did the front of my right leg, up to the top of the shin bone. Today?s date: 1/22/21 5:19 pm and leg and foot still tender and slightly swollen.

                                                At 5 days post vaccination, patient developed severe left shoulder pain, originally thought to be secondary to chronic shoulder pain and a recent fall, over the next three days it progressed to swelling, severe pain, and limited ROM. He ended up being admitted to the hospital and CT scan showed development of significant soft tissue infiltration around sternum and sternoclavicular joints. This was originally thought to be infectious, but he never developed a fever or leukocytosis and we feel this was most likely an inflammatory process. I have no idea if this was actually a vaccine side effect, but given the proximity in both time a location and the known complication of shoulder pain with the vaccine, it seems reasonable to give you the information to monitor for other similar cases.

I had a similar response after having an unconfirmed covid infection two months earlier.  My symptoms have persisted for two weeks now, and I was advised by my PCP not to get the 2nd injection.

                                                Patient had usual post vaccination myalgias and lethargy for a few days after injection.  These resolved spontaneously.  However, about a week after vaccination he developed recurrent fevers 102°F.  He also had complaints of body aches and bilateral jaw pain.  He had extensive evaluation including laboratory testing for infectious etiologies of his fever and none was identified.  He was noted to have very high sed rate and CRP.  When no specific etiology for his fevers could be identified we decided to proceed with a short course of prednisone which did seem to help his fever and jaw pain.  After prednisone was stopped he had recurrence of fever and developed worse jaw pain and pain at the base of his neck. I examined him in clinic and found that he had a tender swollen thyroid.  I directed him to the emergency department where CT scanning of his neck confirmed evidence of thyroiditis.  TSH was undetectable and free T4 was about 2 times higher than normal.  He was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis.  However, his symptomatology seemed quite dramatic for subacute thyroiditis, and the timing in relation to his vaccination is concerning for possible adverse vaccine reaction.

About eleven hours after shot I had headache, feeling of irregular body temperature, nausea, body aches..  I took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea which helped.    About 24 hours after the injection I experienced sore armpit/lymph nodes of shot arm.   All but the symptoms except the sore armpit/lymph nodes  were mostly gone within 30 hours of the shot.  The lymph nodes felt better a day or two later.

                                                Swelling in both lower legs was first noticed while playing sports the day after the shot was taken. Legs still continue to swell when I am in a  prolonged sitting position (&#43;3 hours).  Usually, legs become swollen to a point in which I feel the skin is very tight and they become hard. I have been lying with feet up to relieve the pressure.   Q:  how long will this continue? should I see a doctor? should I take the second Moderna shot? Advice would be appreciated.

                                                Patient was given 2nd Moderna vaccine at about 7:30. Patient was pale and diaphoretic and was lowered to the floor by RN and another patient receiving the vaccine who was a cardiologist. He had several beats of clonus and then woke up. He was awake when his first vital signs were obtained. HR 110, BP 190/96, O2 sat 100%. When he was more awake he was assisted in to a reclining chair. BP monitored every few minutes and dropped as low as SBP 104, HR 70-80s. Pt reported that he periodically syncopizes, last 6mo ago. He reported feeling lightheaded after seeing his arm bleed and be swollen after vaccination. After about 1 hours the patient&#39;s vital signs were stable but he continued to have symptoms of lightheadedness which worsened when I sat him up (though BP was stable). EMS was called and he was transported to the ED.

Sore right arm.   4/24/21 In the morning headache and body ache.  Late afternoon severe body ache, chills, 101 degree fever.  800mgs of ibuprofen and 1000mgs of Tylenol every 6-8 hours did not bring the fever down.  Sore right arm.   4/25/21 Headache and body ache all day. Late afternoon headache continued but with severe body ache, chills, 100 degree fever, swollen lymph nodes in right arm pit,  red, hot and swollen rash between right shoulder and neck,  sore arm.  We called the emergency department  and they stated it could take up to 3 weeks before the painful swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit would dissipate.  They left it up to us whether to come in. We chose not to because we didn&#39;t feel there was anything more they could do for us.

By lunchtime, I am experiencing extreme fatigue, overall body soreness, loss of appetite, and increased pain at the injection site. By 3 pm I am home and in bed, dealing with chills/sweats as well. Couldn&#39;t find any comfort to sleep thru the night. In the morning of the 29th, I&#39;m still displaying all the issues listed above. I stay home from work and go back to bed. I awake at noon to find all the listed issues greatly reduced, but feel soreness in my jaw and feel swelling in the lymph nodes under the jawbone, more so on the right than the left.

                                                Had pain in my shoulder (and  neck on my left side) as soon as the shot went in. At roughly three hours after the shot, I felt I was slurring my speech (I had to make a very concerted effort to make proper sentences and not slur) and was very dizzy. I also was having a hard time with lights. For example, I was unable to look in the mirror in my bathroom as the lights above the mirror were too bright for me. At three hours after the shot, I had severe pain in my left shoulder. Overall, I felt as I had been sedated or drugged. I tried walking to the nearest convenience store to get some food and I felt I was experiencing vertigo. Several days after the vaccine I had a slight cough and sore throat. I am still experiencing a slight cough on some day sand a slight sore throat.   I had a subtle red patch in the left shoulder area a couple days after the shot. Eight or nine days after the shot, I had covid arm and had a very visible red patch on my left shoulder. I have pictures of this.  I have been feeling very tired and dizzy ever since the first shot. My glands in my neck under my jaw line are also swollen. I do not know if it is either  wise or safe for me to get the second shot, which is scheduled for this Friday as it seems that I still have not recovered from the first shot. Can my immune system really take another round of this?  There are a couple other things that I have noticed. I don&#39;t seem to be thinking very clearly and I have noticed a remarkable number of type-os and poor syntax in emails that I send at work; this is not normal for me.   Finally, after the shot, I noticed that my muscles, when doing a little exertion such as pushups, would build lactic acid quicker and more blood seemed to be delivered to my working muscles. I still have not regained my strength and tire more easierly when playing tennis or hitting against the tennis wall, for example. This is also not normal and not how I felt before the first injection.

                                                It started with body weakness; feverish; progressed to chills and high fever; moderate to severe body aches. And headaches severe sinus congestion. These lasted for about one week. I did Augmentin (I&#39;m a dentist). I took Mucinex and Vitamin C, Zinc, and Levothyroxine and Theraflu. These helped my symptoms. I got skin rashes towards end of first week of the symptoms and they still haven&#39;t gone away. They are on my hand back part of the palm. It&#39;s itchy and raised. And I have them on my lower legs, as well. I have recovered from flu like symptoms but not from skin rashes.

Went to the hospital and was checked for a stroke. No stroke detected. While during the exam, my tongue started to swell up and they decided to insert a tube for breathing. Woke up on Sunday after the swelling went down and the tube was removed. Was released from the hospital on Tuesday. Maintained a fever that week and on Friday, my fingers on my left hand and my left foot started to swell again, almost passed out. Went back to the hospital for observation and treatment for a staph infection from the first hospital visit.

When I mentioned my severe reactions, they told me they were filing a report upon my behalf. When done they told me it was the VAERS system and gave me a reference number (Ref-531994). I decided that not enough information would be in that report so wanted to submit myself because of my severe reaction and hospitalization. My PCP was not involved until after hospital for a follow up and I was seen by numerous doctors there, so I have no easy single POC until I dig more.  Mar 26, 2021 Received first Moderna COVID vaccine lot 018B21A. Apr 13, 2021 Pain in knees begins and over approx. 18 hrs. increase rapidly to point of pain walking. Compression of knees to sit worse.

Each swelling last between 18 to 36 hours. This swelling takes place from 21 Apr to 27 Apr.  When a finger swells it becomes red, hot to the touch, and extremely itchy. I have pictures. Apr 17, 2021 Wake to find tongue hugely swelled. Thought I&#39;d bitten in my sleep. Unable to eat, hard to swallow fluid past tongue. Lasts for a bit over 36 hrs. Apr 19, 2021 Knee pain begins spreading up thighs down calves. Pain also beginning in feet toes and ankles. Apr 20, 2021 Knee pain when bending prevents me from entering truck to drive. Apr 27, 2021 Knee pain eases slightly. Able to sit in truck for short period of time until too much pain. Apr 28, 2021 Receive second Moderna COVID vaccine lot 043B21A at 1pm. Apr 28, 2021 Approx. 2:30 pm knee/overall leg pain begins increasing rapidly to higher than before level. Over next three days increases to point where I cannot stand/walk due to pain. Unable to sleep due to pain also. Apr 28, 2021 Same Day-Around 4:30 pm notice voice is becoming raspy. By 6 pm my voice is completely gone. I have no voice for next approx. 36 hrs. Apr 30, 2021 Upper lip begins swelling in early afternoon. Enormous as everything else has been. Lasts approx. 36 hrs. but extremely tender for next 12 hrs. I have pictures. May 2, 2021 Go to ER in morning. Bloodwork/tests done. No conclusive results. Remain in ER overnight waiting for available bed at a hospital. May 3, 2021 Transferred by ambulance in afternoon to hospital. May 4, 2021 Begin seeing multitude of Drs. More bloodwork and testing. Still major pain w no relief. May 4, 2021 Suspected diagnosis is gout. I have never had gout diagnosed for me before but so be. May 4-7, 2021 Receive daily shot of anakinra. May 6, 2021 Begin noticing decrease in pain.

Less each day but still need for stability. Still have knee pain. Have higher level of pain in feet.  I had/have a major reaction to the Moderna vaccine. This should be investigated and reported on. Thank you.

                                                I had pericarditis 2 years ago and 4 days after my 2nd dose of Moderna I felt similar symptoms to when I?d had it. They subsided after a day but came back 3 weeks later. Because of my history of having had Pericarditis I had ultrasound and CT Scan and they showed some inflammation. Blood tests showed  C-reactive Protein levels high (70). On my own I googled if pericarditis was a side effect from vaccine as it was odd to me that my symptoms started so soon after. I read that there have been rare cases reported recently  but mostly in young people and they?ve subsided. Perhaps  because I had it two years ago it triggered a recurrent effect. I was prescribed 600 mg ibuprofen as before by Cardiologist and colchicine as before. My PCP suggested I might want to notify you.  I thought I should report this given what I read and that I&#39;m 55, so it?s different than other reports you?ve received.  I do not know if I have pericarditis again but the symptoms have been identical to when I did and the CRP level increase would suggest so. I had Echo and EKG and heart alright so it&#39;s not Myocarditis. Symptoms included: pain in abdomen chest area, pronounced in URQ this time but it migrated, increased when walking or lying down, difficulty sleeping in side, slightly elevated fever 98.9-95 when I?m usually in  96-98 range, breath hiccups, some nausea. Since taking colchicine and ibuprofen have been feeling better, just concerned that this seemed to have recurred, and started exactly 4 day after my 2nd shot.

This presentation required brief hospitalization for treatment of a presumed cellulitis and further diagnostic workup of fevers and lymphadenopathy.  The patient was treated with antibiotics for cellulitis and empirically for possible tick-borne illness (early Lyme, glandular tularemia) with notable improvement in the skin erythema and fevers.

This resolved within 5 days.  Within 24 hours of receipt of the second dose of Moderna vaccine I developed identical signs and symptoms in my right eye as well as a stye in my left eye and massive lymphadenopathy and swelling in my left axilla (the arm of vaccine administration for both vaccinations).  The eye conditions resolved within 10 days.  However, the lymphadenoapthy persisted for at least 4 months, with moderate resolution.  I continue to have some painless swelling in my left axilla.

On the 4th day, the swelling went down but it didn&#39;t look right so that&#39;s when I went to the Emergency room where they did the EKG. They let me go and got in touch with my doctor which I got an appointment on the 29th. I am experiencing heightened senses and pain. The pain is really bad in my forearm and elbow. It feels like it is weaker than what it was. I can&#39;t lift my arms over my head. It is more intense after the vaccine was administered.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 56-year-old, male patient, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273, and who developed anaphylactic reaction.    The patient&#39;s medical history included blindness and severe allergies to shellfish.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Losartan and Melatonin.    On 28 JAN 2021, approximately 15  minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Patient&#39;s wife called to indicate that her husband had an anaphylactic reaction to the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Patient received the vaccine on 28 JAN 2021 in his left arm. Patient&#39;s wife indicated that her husband texted her at 3.21 pm to let her know that he has gotten the shot, indicating that he must have received it around 3.19 pm. Patient&#39;s wife indicated that around 3.34 pm, patient said he&#39;d had an anaphylactic reaction, that he had administered a shot of epinephrine and that an ambulance was on its way. The patient&#39;s wife noted that the reaction happened within 15 minutes or so. Once in the hospital, the patient was administered Pepcid and Steroid orally. Additional treatment medication for the event included the previously epinephrine and a shot of Benadryl.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the event was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s significant medical history included severe allergies to shellfish.

                                                A severe, dull ache resulted at the vaccination site yesterday several hours after vaccination and radiated down my are, up my neck, and down my back. 1000MG of Tylenal helped, but the ache remains. The arm is swollen, warm to the touch, and black and blue. Today I have a mild fever, some hot flashes, nausea without vomiting, body weakness, and overall muscle aching. This is the sickest I&#39;ve been in years.

                                                I had extremely burning pain on my left hip and quadricep/thigh area that started without warning. Feeling like extreme leg cramps when standing or walking. I did seek medical attention with my orthopedic doctor and had hip xrays on my left hip. She saw mild to moderate arthritis in my hip joint. I was prescribed an anti inflammatory as well as taking tylenol to supplement.  The symptoms have not subsided and I plan on following up with my medical doctor. I have had bad spasms in my hip and thigh area and swelling from the top of my thigh to my knee.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 09 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine the patient had sore arm. On an unspecified date in Jan 2021, the patient had experienced a pull in his muscle in his calf and lower calf area got swollen. On 09 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of vaccine he had experienced a sore arm. On 11 Mar 2021, his leg got really swollen and on 12 Mar 2021, he visited hospital where it got diagnosed as DVT in his right lower calf. Treatment for the events included blood thinner Apixaban. Patient is concerned about possibility of indirect relation of events to the vaccine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the event DVT, leg got really swollen, swelling of the lower calf area and calf pain were unknown at the time of this report. The event pulled a muscle is not resolved. The event sore arm which the patient experienced for both the doses got resolved on 13 Jan and 14 Jan 2021, respectively.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association a causal association between the event of sore arm and the administration of mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The evens of DVT , pulled muscle and swelling of lower calf is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Events were all attributed to muscle strain.

                                                About 3 weeks after receiving the first Moderna shot I developed, what i believed to be a severe charlie horse in my left lower leg that lasted about. week and disopated.   A few weeks later May 9,2021; I noticed discomfort and swelling in the same lower left leg and my, medical alert service dog, kept alerting to it.  I had a regular appointment with my cardioligist on May 10,2021 and advised of my issue and he ordered an ultrasound. The ultra sound revealed blood clots on my llower left leg.  I have never had clotting issues in my life and absolutely believe that this colt was caused by the Moderna vaccine, since i have been on anticoagulants and asprin theray since 2008.

                                                Per MD Clinical Note 3/14/21, &#34;Further discussion with his daughter today-patient has not been able to walk and has had unclear mentation for approximately 8 years after an alcohol related decline.  Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.   Assessment and plan Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia  One week post COVID-19 vaccination  Agitation  Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD, Wernicke    -continue to trend the LFTs downward.  Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

                                                I saw patient on 4/5/2021 in a office setting. Patient received vaccine the evening of 3/27 (exact time unknown). He woke up the am of 3/28 with severe L hand swelling and itching. He then developed hives on trunk and neck. He reports 3-4 days after the vaccine he developed lip swelling. The swelling has gone down, but is still noticeably swollen on my exam on 4/5/2021. He still has wheels present on exam on trunk and neck.

                                                Two days after his covid vaccine injection, he began to feel soreness in his left calf. He thought he was just experiencing a side effect from the vaccine. The soreness got worse and worse until about 2 weeks later when he had significant swelling and pain and could not not walk on the leg. He went to the hospital ED on 3/18 for care. He was admitted to  Hospital on that date for tests and blood thinners. He was discharged on 3/20 but was instructed to return by his PCP for continuing treatment with blood thinners (Eloquis) until she could see him  on Monday - they agreed to keep him in the ED and he was discharged home on Monday to see his PCP.

                                                He got his vaccine, and on Easter he thought that he had a cramp in his leg, and asked his wife and told her that he had this.  By that afternoon he still had the cramping feeling, and started drinking water as his wife is a nurse and felt that he may be dehydrated.  Throughout the week he had a Charlie Horse pain in his left calf, and felt that it was getting worse and not going away.  The whole week he went to work and on the 7th day it started swelling and went to Hospital after he got off of work, and he saw a resident who said that his leg was swollen and told him that she was going to schedule an ultrasound.  He had that on Friday on 4/16/21, and was scheduled for 4:00 but due to the pain went to the ER and gave him IV and checked his blood work.  The ultrasound showed that he did have a blood clot and prescribed Eliquis and gave him a dose while in the ER.  He told him that he would be on 2 a dat for 7 days  and then 1 a day, but did not tell him how long.  He is supposed to see the resident this afternoon for recheck.   He is still having pain and wanting to know where he is going to do from this point.    He does work out every day at his home gym and has not smoked, and now wanting to know how this is going to affect his life from this point into the future.  He also jumps rope 3 times a day and now not able to do this.

Large areas of rashes occur on the upper part of both legs, upper body, neck and face. Waited for another day to see if the side effects will disappear on the 9th days. But the rashes become even worse. Seeing the Dr. on April 30th at 11:10am. She prescribed Prednisone 20mg  for 2 pills a day for 5 days. She also asked me to take Clariton 10mg 1 pill a day for 7 days. This is my second day after seeing the doctor. The swelling becomes less severe, but the rashes continue to be big.

                                                I suffered relatively severe reaction to the 2nd Moderna dose:  Very sore arm for 4 or 5 days, several hours of chills 14 hours after the injection, and swollen lymph nodes, including an egg-sized lump under the left arm that persisted for a week.  However, the significant event was a seizure 10 days after the injection.  This was a first seizure with no prior history or obvious cause.   Seizure began while I was asleep.  Wife heard odd noises, couldn&#39;t wake me and called 911.  I woke up in an ER hours later.  Neurologist said the MRI was clear, but EEG showed unusual activity in the left temporal lobe.  Prescribed Keppra (ongoing) and speculated that the seizure might be related to aging. He thought the timing of the event 10 days after the CoViD vaccine was coincidental.  However, I am reporting it out of an abundance of caution.

                                                The day of the shot, we noticed significant swelling in my neck on the right of center.  The swelling has maintained its size for now six weeks and one day.  I have a dull numbness in my 2-3 smaller toes of my left foot.  Sometimes I feel this numbness in my right foot, but not always.  My left arm and two smallest fingers also feel funny.  There is a dull pain in my left arm and dull numbness in my left smaller fingers.  The outside of my left leg also at times shares this numb feeling.  On the day I got the shot I immediately felt like I had a dose of caffeine, though that feeling passed after a couple of hours.  It did not feel significant enough to keep me from driving or leaving the facility, but it was noticeable. I experienced diarrhea for about a week and a half. For the first week after the shot I alternated nights of not being able to stay still sleeping, keeping me awake almost the entire night, 3 of the first 6 nights.  I visited my family doctor within one week of the first shot.  He advised me not to get the second shot and made note of the swelling in my neck. I visited him at five weeks because the swelling in my neck and numb feeling has not changed.  He scheduled a CT Scan which has been scheduled.

                                                Swelling in the left armpit same side as shot.  An area about 3 inches around bulging out about 1 inch.  Moderate pain.  It started about 2 weeks after the vaccine.  The swelling has started going down several times and then would swell back up again.  The same reaction happened after the 2nd dose, which was in the right arm.  Both armpits are still swollen 4/7/2021. The swelling is currently about 2 inches around and swollen out about 1/2 inch. There is not pain now it is only discomfort.  I reported this to the rescue squad president where I am a volunteer. They are the ones who told us to get the vaccine and made the arrangements.  I do not have a doctor.

With all the questions asked beforehand, why doesn&#39;t anyone ask if you already had COVID, and tell you you are more likely than others to have severe side effects?

                                                In a nutshell, patient was fine, got the first shot of the Moderna Vaccine on 3/24/21, then began to exhibit many covid-like symptoms starting around 4 hours later but 3 times nasal swap tested negative for COVID19 including before and after vaccination. Suffered with various attempts at treatments and tests for approximately a month and then was admitted to the ER at hospital on 4/28/21.  Wife (former smoker who lives in same house and has lung problems) who took the vaccine at the same time from the same lot suffered minor arm pain, aches and pains and fatigue but was fine the next day.  Patient (59) had normal blood pressure and clear lungs in good health, non-smoker, good weight, exercises regularly and strenuously, good diet, rarely gets ill. He works as a ship?s captain and engineer and has worked in boatyards for years doing physical work. Has tintinnitis and in one eye, glaucoma drops but is on no other prescription medicines. Details: March: had nasal congestion, cough and suspected bronchitis, aches and pains, no fever, PCR tested negative for COVID19, and was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin and then a run of amoxycillin), proair, advair discuss a couple of days, various vitamins/minerals, over the counter cold/flu medicines. Seemed to work with most symptoms going away prior to Marcch 24, 2021. March 24, 2021 morning: Got first shot of the Moderna Vaccine at pharmacy. Lot 045A21A at same time as spouse. That morning had no cough and felt ok. Approximately 4 hours later, patient started to cough, felt congested, felt like flu/pneumonia, trouble breathing, aches and pains especially in joints, extreme fatigue, headache, (but suffered no loss of taste or smell throughout 3/24-present) took Theraflu and went to bed early, slept well. Following days, struggled with intensifying symptoms. Felt like the vaccine gave him covid symptoms without the loss of smell/taste.  Spouse experienced minor pain at point of injection, some fatigue, aches and pains which went away by end of next day 3/25/21. Spouse had some lingering cough left over from earlier bronchitis before getting the vaccine which cough/congested breathing continued with no noticeable change. [Spouse was also not adversely impacted by the second shot of Moderna vaccine a month later.) Apr Wk1 &amp; Wk2: Increasing difficulty sleeping due to lung congestion or suddenly waking up wide awake for no reason. At end of Wk2, had some minor tremors in muscles for a couple of days. Suffered from extreme fatigue, congestion, trouble breathing, nightmares, aches and pains. Took azithromycin run then a run of amoxicillin, proair, prednisone, albuterol nebulizer, occasional Theraflu or over-the-counter cold/flu medicines, vitamins/minerals (including heavier doses of Vitamin D, Zinc, C, etc.), probiotic acidophilus, tonic water with quinine or Perrier, melatonin 10mg and magnesium 500mg at night, occasionally a Unisom sleeping pill. Started to lose appetite where rarely hungry. Would force himself to eat anyway, but occasionally vomited it up. Apr Wk3 4/13/21: Patient got another PCR covid test which was negative, chest xray, blood work done at Urgent Care. Showed some elevated liver/kidney enzymes and low red blood cell count/anemia, vague thickening of the plura, swollen lymphnode in the chest xray, no sign of cardiovascular issue. (Some yellow flags but nothing flashing red.) Dr. recommended followup tests and bloodwork and that he get GI/Cardio/pulmonary workups w/specialists. Patient continued to take antibiotics, pregnizone, albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals, and occasional cold/flu/cough medicines, etc. Added SuperB Complex. One day he had hot/cold chills for a few hours. Apr Wk4: While lungs felt clearer, still coughing and now occasionally vomiting productively or dry heaves, insomnia grew into bigger issue with hallucinations not just with nightmares but occasionally during the day where it was difficult to separate reality from dream, trouble remembering, started to feel paranoid/irrational sometimes, trouble sleeping was not due to lung congestion but more due to panic-attack like heavy breathing or sudden central chest/sternum pain (maybe from coughs), aches in joints, but biggest problem was extreme fatigue and tiring when walking up a flight of stairs, etc. Took some Tramadol occasionally for pain relief (but never with aspirin, Tylenol or cold medicine). Could be sitting comfortably watching a mellow tv program but suddenly need to breathe really heavy, hyperventilating and felt need to standup and walk around until it eased. Extreme trouble sleeping. Most comfortable position was kneeling with body bent over a pillow on the bed. [He&#39;d never had panic-attacks/heavy breathing issues before the Moderna shot and doesn&#39;t abuse substances.] Wk5: 4/24/21 feet swelled up and turned purple on the soles. Went for a walk around the block and raised feet. No longer on antibiotics or pregnizone, only taking the albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals/probiotics, melatonin and a OTC cough/flu medicine before bed. Knelt for hours while trying to sleep. 4/25/21, feet more swollen with fluid and more discolored. When searched online, they looked like &#34;covid toes&#34;. Took no medicines except nebulizer and took only a couple of vitamins/calcium-vitaminD and before bed a beer, melatonin, magnesium &amp; nyquil. 4/26/21, feet less swollen and no longer purple except a small line on the side of one foot. Patient indicated he had not knelt when trying to sleep prone during night. But only got a couple of hours of sleep, nighttime hallucinations and panic-breathing attacks. Daytime inability to focus, extreme fatigue, aches and pains, quick to tire on any exertion, vomiting food or dry heaves 2 or 3 times that day, panic-like-attacks with need to heavy breathe/hyperventilate. Wheezing with occasional rattle at end. Coughs sometimes productive, sometimes not but lungs didn?t feel very congested and oxygenation/blood pressure was good. 4/27/21, went to work in morning and was able to perform but very tired. In early afternoon, came home, ate, took nyquil and nebulizer and tried to sleep. 4/28/21, felt much worse, feet and knees swollen, extreme exhaustion, felt miserable. Went to work anyway. Came home around 2pm, ate. Felt much worse so we went to the ER at Hospital. Spouse provided MMC with his medical conditions, medicines, the info on COVID IGG serology test and informed them of the chest xrays and bloodwork that had been done at the Urgent Care center 2 weeks prior. ER indicated he needed to stay overnight and they performed additional bloodwork, xrays, scans and MRIs. The ER doctor called in specialists in Nephrology and Cardiology to provide consultations.

                                                12 Hours after vaccine pain in left arm 15 hours after vaccine, fever started and lasted on and off for two days.  Reached 102 and did not drop below 101 even using Tylenol or Ibuprofen. On day two fever went down but at about 36-48 hours went back up to 99.5 until finally going away after 48 hours. During the first 48 hours experienced body chills, fatigue, some nausea, body aches, some joint shooting pain randomly, headache. On days 2-3 started developing a hot red painful patch about 2 inches below the shot location. On day 4 it is light pink and almost gone, the pain has localized in one spot which seems to have some swelling under the skin (not the actual shot location).   Item 20 asks if there has been recovery.  That&#39;s not a yes/no answer as most symptoms have gone away, but the lingering pain and patch are still there, but seem to be getting better by the day.

My hand continued to swell for at least 24 - 36 hours and looked as though I had been stung by a stinging insect such as yellow jacket or hornet.  I was bitten by a mosquito on 17 May 2021 under my left eye and the whole side of my face swelled up as if I had been stung by a stinging insect again.  In both cases the area turned red and puffy and tender to the touch.  I have never had this issue until now.
