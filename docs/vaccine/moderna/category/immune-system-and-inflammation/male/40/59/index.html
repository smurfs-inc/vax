Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                The shot was administered in my left arm.  I experienced localized swelling and axillary lymph node tenderness immediately after injection under my left armpit.  The right side of my face also became numb for about 5 minutes.  The next morning the areas around my eyes were swollen and I had two styes in my right eye.  I do not know if these were related.  These symptoms lasted approximately 3 days.  Some minimal swelling and tenderness seemed to remain, and approximately a week later I experienced a painful resurgence of the swelling at the injection site that was far larger, harder and more painful.  I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen.  These relieved the symptoms within 48 hours.

Approximately 48 hours later (evening 01/14/2021) started to notice increased inflammation about the size of a &#34;quarter&#34; on left side of chin. I did have a pimple/ingrown hair at this site prior to the injection which was mostly healed but not entirely healed. The next morning, 01/15/2021, I experience mild facial numbness to the left side of my chin and mild facial paralysis resulting in an asymmetrical smile, and mild swelling to the left side of my face. Two day later (morning 01/17/2021) with my symptoms not worsening but showing only a little improvement, I went to my local urgent care for evaluation. Provider was not 100% sure of the diagnosis but felt this could be a case of shingles or folliculitis. I was treated with a 7 day course of acyclovir and a 10 day course of doxycycline hyclate. The numbness subsided 2-3 days after treatment began. The facial paralysis and swelling showed much improvement (90-95%) after completing the acyclovir on 01/24/2021; however, I feel there is still a little more improvement to go.

                                                I received my Vaccine on 1/19/2021, on Friday 1/22/2021 my arm pit/Lymph node started to hurt. Then one week later on 1/26/2021 I started having vaccine shoulder itchiness I didn&#39;t think anything of it and then my arm swelled and got hot. The next day on 1/27/2021 it had a red area around it and was hot. I have never had a fever or anything else except minor pain the day after the vaccine.  I continued ibuprofen and benadryl at night it took the itch away and was bearable. I want to know if I should get the second shot? I have it scheduled for 2-15-2021 @ 2:00 pm PST I also have pictures

Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

                                                Entire left arm, all the way from shoulder to the fingers swelled up to 1.5 times the normal size. The left index figure and thumb started tingling and became numb. The pain is present in the front and back of the left shoulder as well. Saw a Dr and she told me to take 4 x 200mg Motrin every 6hrs for next 4-5 days. She also gave Tylenol 3. The pain was so acute that I asked my doctor to just chop off my arm. I couldn&#39;t sleep, I couldn&#39;t stand, sit or lay down. It hurt all the time. Lost all strength in the left hand and arm.  Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help with the pain. The swelling went down quite a bit in 3 days. Motrin caused a flare up of Crohn&#39;s.   Saw another Dr 5 days later. She prescribed gebapentin, flexrel, norco, toradol, etc. It&#39;s now been almost 20 days since the injection. The pain has subsided but not completely gone. I am still unable to do much work and it hurts just to sit! I still have pain and still do not have my strength back. I am still unable to go back to work.

                                                It was the Moderna Vaccine. I had a prescheduled meeting to get some tests done on the Monday, following my vaccine (02/22/2021). The results of those labs showed a severe inflammatory response. My blood platelet levels were at 27, and my CRP was at 15. I started bruising easily, which I have never done before, and I had serious body aches and fatigue. I met with Dr.  on Tuesday, March 16, 2021 to do some follow up tests. At this point, my platelet levels were up to 96, much improved, but still low. He said that it could very likely be connected to the vaccine. I had the first dose on January 23, 2021, and the second dose on February 20, 2021. I now have to get additional tests to see if these levels improve.

                                                After my first dose vaccine, I developed two large lymph nodes in the sub clavicular aspect of my clavicle, left side.  I went to see my surgeon who palpated them and said that they would go down in one or two weeks.  These lymph nodes are still present today and I am concerned because I do not know when they will go away.

He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

As of today 1/12/21 I am still experiencing symptoms even while using Benadryl allergy tablets by mouth and anti-itch cream applied to the injection site.

Symptoms after 2nd shot01/19/2021 - slight fatigue recovered after 24 hours.  4 days after 2nd shot - Developed cold sore on lower lip area. To my recollection, I have never had a cold sore before which is a bit concerning. I understand that I may contracted HSV-1 and not have know it as child. I am curious if somehow the COVID vaccine somehow compromised immune system to a degree that the HSV-1 is now active? May very well not classify as an &#34;adverse event,&#34; but since I haven&#39;t heard of any such issues I thought I should report.

I had it checked out at the walk in clinic and they said it was an allergic reaction and to take Benadryl along with icing the arm.  I was not the best at following this but once I started doing this is started to get better and was cleared up within a week.

                                                I received my first dose of the COVID vaccine on January 12, 2021.  I had a headache on the night of Jan 15 so took two Tylenol pills.  I woke up with a worse headache so took two Excedrin Migraine pills in the morning.  At about 10 am I started a 10 mile run, which is not unusually long for me.  I finished before noon and when I urinated , it was almost all blood, which has never happened to me before.  I went to the emergency room.  They gave me IV fluids and took some blood tests.  My creatinine levels were abnormally high but the doctor felt I overexerted myself and was too dehydrated even though the workout was not unusually for me.  On January 18th, I developed a quite painful lump in my left armpit, that lasted about a week.  I saw my primary care physician on Jan 23rd for a follow up.  He thought the lump was a swollen lymph node from the vaccine and was not concerned.  He scheduled blood tests and an ultrasound of my kidneys, all of which came back normal. I received my second vaccine shot on Feb 9th.  I developed a headache that night and have had a headache most of the time since.  I have taken several pills of Excedrin Migraine over these few days.  I also traveled to San Diego on the 10th and did a fairly long and arduous hike up a mountain on the 11th.  Although it was intense, it?s the type of hike I do several times a year and not completely out of the ordinary.  I was also a bit dehydrated again.  I woke early morning on the 12th with another headache so I took two more Excedrin MIgraines and went back to bed.  When I awoke about 6am, I urinated blood again.  I urinated blood for several hours and have finally drank enough water to end the blood urination. I normally work out intensely several times a week and do have bouts of dehydration.  But I have never urinated blood before.  I can?t help but believe it?s no coincidence that the two times in my life I?ve urinated blood have coincided with COVID vaccine shots.  Not sure how my exercises, dehydration, and use of NSAIDs  have contributed but something is going on and it needs to be investigated.

                                                On the first day I had a huge lump underneath my armpit I did not become too concerned with that I read it was something that could happen regarding the lymph node. 10 days later I woke up at 3:30 in the morning and had to dial 911 my throat felt like it was closing and my lips were both swollen. I went in the ambulance they brought me to the emergency room where they gave me Benadryl a steroid and some IV fluids. as soon as I receive the Benadryl my throat started to open up and my lips both started to go down . My lip continue to swell for the next three days on and off often on. Every time it swelled up I took Benadryl and every time sure enough it went away . The day I came home from the hospital I thought I was doing much better until that following night I became severely nauseous. I don?t know if it was something that they had given me in the hospital or still a reaction that was going on in my body, but I had some sort of stomach bug I threw up that whole day, had chills sweats  and a pounding headache that would not go away for over 48 hours .I was unable to eat or drink for 24 hours and had to go to an urgent care where they provided me with some medication for nausea. My concern right now is I am hearing that the second shot hits a lot harder than the first one and if this was a reaction to the shot I am very afraid of what will go on if I get the second one.  I cannot take a chance with my life.  I really want to shot I work in an environment where I am working with the department  which is why I was able to get the vaccine so early I feel safe being vaccinated I am very disappointed that this happened I just cannot take a chance having a family etc. Also I have very bad medical in Sherance so I am dealing with all of the bills from this hospital stay I have a  deductible which I can?t afford and then only 50% is covered afterwards. That is the reason I do not go to the hospital under no circumstance unless I am dying which that night I was that scared I felt the need I had to go.

Got home from work and noticed my left side was kind of swollen. chest and back. It felt a bit like a bee sting. I slept on my left side. Woke up with numbness on my whole left side. face was numb. My wife said it was kind of like bells palsy. Face kind of twitched a bit. Hip was numb walking was slow and I was careful as I went to the grocery store . It kind of leveled out but stayed numb all of work. I was still swollen after work.   Woke up on Sunday and my arm was hurting bad. numbness had dissipated.   ate then suddenly felt flush and hot. fetal position on the bed for a half hour then I had to drag myself to work. felt bad the first few hours but as the night went on I felt better.   I could always feel it behind my eyes. early on it felt like I was discharging a bunch of stuff from them. My body was literally numb on the left half. I could feel the middle of myself from my scalp to my toes.

                                                Swelling inside collar bone area on side of injection. Possibly lymph node. First time noticing swelling is approximately 7 days after 1st injection.  Over the next 3 weeks, swelling decreased to almost normal until 2nd dose.  After that, swelling was noticed approximately 48 hours later and correlated vaccine with swelling. Between the 1st and 2nd dose, I visited MD, Physical Therapists, Massage therapist.  Other symptoms included popping of collar bone when shrugging shoulder.

                                                Nearly two weeks after injection, I now have a 4 inch diameter circle of redness with slight swelling and itchy.  I noticed it after showering two days ago.  It almost looks like a localized allergic reaction but it did not appear until 2 weeks after the shot.  It is slightly warmer to touch than the rest of the area but it is not painful at all.  I had similar markings plus moderate pain around the injection site1-2 days after the shot but they quickly dissipated.  I am not sure if this should be reportable or not but I was a little concerned considering the amount of time that has passed since the shot and considering I am due for my second shot in a couple of weeks.

                                                I didn&#39;t have any adverse affects until 5 days after I received the vaccination. Early in the afternoon on Wednesday 1/20 I noticed that my lymph nodes in the armpit of my left arm and on the left side of my neck were swollen and sore. This worsened as the day went on. I also noticed a pimple had formed and came to a head in the exact spot of where the needle stick had been. It &#34;popped&#34; that day and a small amount material came out. My lymph nodes have remained sore and swollen since 1/20. On the 7th day after (1/22) I noticed a couple of smaller, dime sized red blotches/rash on my left shoulder and left side of my neck. I also noticed that the injection site on my left shoulder was sore, swollen and hot to touch. On the 8th day (1/23) I noticed that there were more of these dime sized red blotches/rash across both shoulders, my back and a small area in the center of my chest.  It continues to be like that as of today (1/25). On the 9th day, (1/24) starting just after noon, I began to feel poorly. Achy and just generally not very good. I had a few bouts of diarrhea throughout the afternoon. I also had a pretty strong headache when I awoke on the morning of the 24th. Today, (1/25) I awoke again with a headache although it was not as sore as yesterday. I don&#39;t feel great today, but I do feel better than I did yesterday. The rash looks the same and my lymph nodes seem to be slightly less swollen and less sore.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

                                                Night of 2nd vaccine woke up with a high fever, and severe headache. Fever lasted 36 hours and peaked at 104.8 (with Tylenol).  Fever was over 103 degrees for majority of 24 hour period. Fever went away after 36 hours.  However, headaches have continued constantly (17 days and counting).    Went to the Dr. on 2/19/21.  They wanted an CT Scan of head and sinuses.  Dr. Prescribed cefuroxime 250 MG tablet in case of sinus infection and ibuprofen 800 MG tablets.  Insurance did not approve a STAT CT Scan, so Dr. told me to go to the ER if headache persisted.  Went to the ER on  2/23/21.  Dr&#39;s indicated Blood pressure was very high (180/120).  I do not have a history of high blood pressure.  They did a CT scan (normal) EKG (normal), and blood work.  They inserted an IV with migraine cocktail to alleviate headache.  Unfortunately no change.  While in the ER they gave me:  - Sodium Chloride - Tylenol - Metoclopramide (injection) - DiphenhydrAMINE (Benedryl) (injection) - Dexamethsone  - Ketorolac (Toradol)  They prescribed methylprednisolone (steroid).  Went back to primary doctor on 2/25.  Blood pressure remains high (average 158/112 throughout the day), headaches continue (constant).  They did more blood work, urine sample, and another EKG.   They also ordered a STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM.  The prescribed lisinopril 10 MG tablet for blood pressure.

                                                Patient got his Covid vaccine this past Thursday, 2 days ago.  He experienced typical side effects of a sore left shoulder and some fatigue but was feeling well until this afternoon around 1:55 PM when he noticed throbbing of his left hand.  He looked down and noticed that there was a purple discoloration to his middle finger and distal palmar aspect of his hand.  He felt like there was maybe some swelling as well and that he might have been having an allergic reaction so called the emergency department for further advice and came in for evaluation.  By the time I arrived to the emergency department the patient&#39;s left hand was no longer swollen and there was only a small purple discoloration to the palmar proximal middle finger.  I was concerned that the patient developed a small blood clot that was resolved upon evaluation.

Did not think too much of it at first, however the area grew a little and swelled up.  Consulted with my doctor and they diagnosed Shingles.  Am currently prescribed Valtrex for shingles.

I had a loss of appetite, nausea, and no energy.  My fever lasted for approximately 30 hours before subsiding.  I alternated Tylenol and Alieve during my time with fever.  On Sunday, February 7, I began having mouth sores and fever blister on my lips.  For this, I used Lysine, both tablet and lip ointment.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

He has been alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen to bring down the fever, then it will go right back up. He was covid tested today and was negative with a rapid covid test.

Slightly itchy, slightly painful, and very warm on second day.

                                                During the first and second day, my upper left arm was slightly tender from the shot. When that pain subsided during the second day after the shot, I started to get some swelling and pain in my left armpit. Discomfort was such that it interfered with my ability to sleep through that night. The following day (Day 3 after injection) the discomfort mostly subsided but still has not completely gone away. Currently on Day 6 after injection. No treatments or medications have been applied to alleviate the issue.

                                                Received Moderna COVID vaccination 4/1/21. About 27 hours later, he felt muscle spasming across his chest. He then developed neck pain, tingling that goes into right and left arms/fingers. Was started on oral steroids by his PCP on 4/6/21. Given worsening symptoms and new development of urinary retention. Patient was admitted to Hospital 4/8-4/11. Suspected to have cervical transverse myelitis.  Re-admitted 4/12 due to worsening generalized weakness, significant numbness, gait/coordination issues, and several falls. Differential diagnosis includes guillain barre syndrome vs. transverse myelitis. No MS on brain MRI. No cord lesion. Treatment included IVIG 0.5g/kg daily x 4 days, B12, 1 mg IM daily x 3 days. bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  4/7: MRI cervical spine: Small focal area of increased T2 signal within the central cervical cord at the C2 level without associated postcontrast enhancement. A demyelinating disease is leading differential consideration. 4/11: MRI brain: normal, no de-myelinating disease; MRI C-spine: severe cervical stenosis with flattening of spinal cord but no cord edema/enhancement.

He had no prior coronary disease. This operation was done for an enlarging aortic root aneurysm in the setting of Marfan syndrome. The right coronary was anomalous and needed vein extension for reimplantation. He recovered very well and was seen in our clinic on 4/23, with no unusual findings. He had a normal echo, EKG and DVT study performed.   On 4/28 he had his first Moderna COVID19 dose. on 5/1, he developed malaise, myalgias, painful lymph nodes, chills, and chest pain. He called my clinic and was instructed to go to the ER, but then felt better and didn&#39;t go. He was then found unresponsive later that afternoon and was pronounced dead on arrival of EMS.

                                                I began with chills on Weds. morning around 10am that only got worse not matter what I did. My arm continued to hurt but I thought it was just the injection pain. I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit. Dr. feels this was and allergic reaction and recommends I do not get the second injection.

I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

                                                The second evening after having my 2nd Moderna dose my left arm completely froze up. I was only able to lift my arm above my head with assistance from my right arm. Eventually I was able to lift my arm without assistance and the same phenomena happened the third evening where my shoulder was frozen and immobilized.  The frozen shoulder has abated but there is still moving poi&#39;s of major swelling in the upper arm. There has been persistent but slowly abating symptoms of deep soreness, arm weakness and weak grip strength. Swelling persists in the upper front portion of left shoulder. I can not do extended tasks with the arm because it does not have strength nor stamina.

                                                I experienced &#34;Moderna Arm&#34; on the day following the injection, but it subsided after a couple of days. Eight days later, though, it returned (swelling/redness/milder pain) -- accompanied by swelling in my right ankle and tightness/some tingling/mild pain in my right ankle/upper calf. I suffered a blood clot for the first time in each leg in early November; the more serious of the two was in the vicinity of my upper calf in my right leg. In December, I began to experience sensations in my right ankle that were similar (albeit more intense) to what I later experienced after my vaccine; the post-vaccination symptom in my right calf was also similar (but milder) to what I had experienced from the DVT.

This subsided and then on day 3 he developed severe substernal chest pain and came to ER where his hs-cTnI was &gt; 2000 ng/L and peaked at 6700 ng/L.  His ECG, echo and cardiac cath were normal but MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular dysfunction. He is doing well clinically and we are managing expectantly.

Seen 9 days after vaccine administration, he has inflammatory polyarthritis, with R hand significantly swollen, L hand mildly so; bilateral shoulder pain with decreased ROM, bilateral hip pain and spine pain.  saying he can feel every joint - difficult to move around (unusual for this 52 yo male).    He increased his ibuprofen to 800 TID and increased his tylenol to 1 g TID without relief.  Pt was given a shot of steroids (SoluMedrol) on 2/27 with some improvement by 3/1, but not completed resolution of swelling, grip strength or pain.

By the following morning, I felt that skin area, as well as the area around both of my eyes to feel as if I had sustained second degree burns. Additionally, the skin around my eyes particularly, presented with extreme dryness and geriatric symptoms, such as wrinkling and streched thinned skin, as if I were an elderly person (over 75 years old, and not 52).  The flaring/burning subsided after 4-5 days. However, the skin dryness around the eyes has persisted to this day (i.e. 5 weeks past the 1st vaccination). A day after the 2nd part of the vaccination, I felt moderate dizziness and headache, which lasted for about 24 hours. Also, light soreness and skin stiffening were experienced at the arm location where the shot was adminmistered.

                                                I woke up the following day and felt an itching or irritation on the inside of both elbows.  I discovered to pink, bumpy and inflamed areas, mildly itchy. This is all that I have at this point, aside from injection site pain, and maybe some dizziness or fatigue.

                                                No reaction to first shot. Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

The next day his symptoms got worse so he took Benadryl since he thought he was having an allergic reaction but he continued to get worse.  The third day his speech was getting worse, his face continued to swell and droop and he still had severe headache on the left side.  Pt ended up going to the ER where they did a CT, EKG, Chest X-Ray, blood work, gave him IV fluids and steroids. The ER Dr. consulted a Neurologist which told him he had the symptoms of Bell Palsy so they did the stroke protocol but ended up telling him his symptoms were from taking the Covid Vaccine.   He was told to finish his medicine that they prescribed which is steroid and antibiotic and if he did not get any better to come back for FU.

The rash was pink, slightly inflamed, and was slightly feverish.  I had mild itching associated with the rash.  The rash lasted approximately 48 hours.  I would categorize the symptoms as mild.  The fact that they appeared 6 days after the vaccination was administered was interesting to me.

On 11 Mar 2021, the patient reported that he experienced a moderate reaction; throat closure (not complete).  He stated that it felt like anaphylaxis.  He also reported having a numb tongue. He reported that the reaction was not immediate and that  it started about four hours after the vaccine.    Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovered/resolved. The outcome of the event, anaphylactic reaction, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 53-year-old male who experienced a serious anaphylactic reaction with serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation and throat closure.  Event onset occurred the same day as the first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment not reported. Atrial fibrillation resolved, and anaphylaxis resolving.

                                                Initially there was soreness at injection site which lasted about a week, lessening with each day. I was incredibly fatigued for about three days after. Also, the entire right forearm felt sore for about a week, as well. The day after vaccine shot, my right testes was achey and sore (and still is uncomfortable) Also, the top side of my right foot was very tender. During the course of the week, that part of my foot became lightly swollen as did the front of my right leg, up to the top of the shin bone. Today?s date: 1/22/21 5:19 pm and leg and foot still tender and slightly swollen.

On 27th - felt better; but my foot (right ball, top of foot and big toe and toe right next to big toe) started swelling up. I went to the Dr. - gave me meds for the swelling (Prednisone)(I don&#39;t have a history of gout). It went away and I was fatigued for two weeks. That went away and then got my second dose (on January 19th) my toe swelled up again and they tested it this time and it was URIC acid for gout.

                                                At 5 days post vaccination, patient developed severe left shoulder pain, originally thought to be secondary to chronic shoulder pain and a recent fall, over the next three days it progressed to swelling, severe pain, and limited ROM. He ended up being admitted to the hospital and CT scan showed development of significant soft tissue infiltration around sternum and sternoclavicular joints. This was originally thought to be infectious, but he never developed a fever or leukocytosis and we feel this was most likely an inflammatory process. I have no idea if this was actually a vaccine side effect, but given the proximity in both time a location and the known complication of shoulder pain with the vaccine, it seems reasonable to give you the information to monitor for other similar cases.

                                                Patient had usual post vaccination myalgias and lethargy for a few days after injection.  These resolved spontaneously.  However, about a week after vaccination he developed recurrent fevers 102°F.  He also had complaints of body aches and bilateral jaw pain.  He had extensive evaluation including laboratory testing for infectious etiologies of his fever and none was identified.  He was noted to have very high sed rate and CRP.  When no specific etiology for his fevers could be identified we decided to proceed with a short course of prednisone which did seem to help his fever and jaw pain.  After prednisone was stopped he had recurrence of fever and developed worse jaw pain and pain at the base of his neck. I examined him in clinic and found that he had a tender swollen thyroid.  I directed him to the emergency department where CT scanning of his neck confirmed evidence of thyroiditis.  TSH was undetectable and free T4 was about 2 times higher than normal.  He was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis.  However, his symptomatology seemed quite dramatic for subacute thyroiditis, and the timing in relation to his vaccination is concerning for possible adverse vaccine reaction.

                                                First symptoms to appear were noticeably sore right arm and fatigue about six hours after injection.  About eleven hours after shot I had headache, feeling of irregular body temperature, nausea, body aches..  I took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea which helped.    About 24 hours after the injection I experienced sore armpit/lymph nodes of shot arm.   All but the symptoms except the sore armpit/lymph nodes  were mostly gone within 30 hours of the shot.  The lymph nodes felt better a day or two later.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 56-year-old, male patient, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273, and who developed anaphylactic reaction.    The patient&#39;s medical history included blindness and severe allergies to shellfish.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Losartan and Melatonin.    On 28 JAN 2021, approximately 15  minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Patient&#39;s wife called to indicate that her husband had an anaphylactic reaction to the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Patient received the vaccine on 28 JAN 2021 in his left arm. Patient&#39;s wife indicated that her husband texted her at 3.21 pm to let her know that he has gotten the shot, indicating that he must have received it around 3.19 pm. Patient&#39;s wife indicated that around 3.34 pm, patient said he&#39;d had an anaphylactic reaction, that he had administered a shot of epinephrine and that an ambulance was on its way. The patient&#39;s wife noted that the reaction happened within 15 minutes or so. Once in the hospital, the patient was administered Pepcid and Steroid orally. Additional treatment medication for the event included the previously epinephrine and a shot of Benadryl.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the event was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s significant medical history included severe allergies to shellfish.

                                                A severe, dull ache resulted at the vaccination site yesterday several hours after vaccination and radiated down my are, up my neck, and down my back. 1000MG of Tylenal helped, but the ache remains. The arm is swollen, warm to the touch, and black and blue. Today I have a mild fever, some hot flashes, nausea without vomiting, body weakness, and overall muscle aching. This is the sickest I&#39;ve been in years.

                                                I had extremely burning pain on my left hip and quadricep/thigh area that started without warning. Feeling like extreme leg cramps when standing or walking. I did seek medical attention with my orthopedic doctor and had hip xrays on my left hip. She saw mild to moderate arthritis in my hip joint. I was prescribed an anti inflammatory as well as taking tylenol to supplement.  The symptoms have not subsided and I plan on following up with my medical doctor. I have had bad spasms in my hip and thigh area and swelling from the top of my thigh to my knee.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 09 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine the patient had sore arm. On an unspecified date in Jan 2021, the patient had experienced a pull in his muscle in his calf and lower calf area got swollen. On 09 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of vaccine he had experienced a sore arm. On 11 Mar 2021, his leg got really swollen and on 12 Mar 2021, he visited hospital where it got diagnosed as DVT in his right lower calf. Treatment for the events included blood thinner Apixaban. Patient is concerned about possibility of indirect relation of events to the vaccine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the event DVT, leg got really swollen, swelling of the lower calf area and calf pain were unknown at the time of this report. The event pulled a muscle is not resolved. The event sore arm which the patient experienced for both the doses got resolved on 13 Jan and 14 Jan 2021, respectively.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association a causal association between the event of sore arm and the administration of mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The evens of DVT , pulled muscle and swelling of lower calf is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Events were all attributed to muscle strain.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

                                                The day of the shot, we noticed significant swelling in my neck on the right of center.  The swelling has maintained its size for now six weeks and one day.  I have a dull numbness in my 2-3 smaller toes of my left foot.  Sometimes I feel this numbness in my right foot, but not always.  My left arm and two smallest fingers also feel funny.  There is a dull pain in my left arm and dull numbness in my left smaller fingers.  The outside of my left leg also at times shares this numb feeling.  On the day I got the shot I immediately felt like I had a dose of caffeine, though that feeling passed after a couple of hours.  It did not feel significant enough to keep me from driving or leaving the facility, but it was noticeable. I experienced diarrhea for about a week and a half. For the first week after the shot I alternated nights of not being able to stay still sleeping, keeping me awake almost the entire night, 3 of the first 6 nights.  I visited my family doctor within one week of the first shot.  He advised me not to get the second shot and made note of the swelling in my neck. I visited him at five weeks because the swelling in my neck and numb feeling has not changed.  He scheduled a CT Scan which has been scheduled.
