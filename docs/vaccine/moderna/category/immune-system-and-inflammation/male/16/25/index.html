By 1/24/21, there was less swelling, and discomfort and the erythematous rash had become eczematous in places and thicker than the previous day.  The palms didn&#39;t have an appreciable rash. However, Patient felt much discomfort there (not exactly painful) and some paresthesia. He felt that his fingers were swollen. By 1/24/21, the discomfort in both palms was worse.

Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

A ER note was  generated in a T-Con on a patient who got their 2nd Covid Vaccine and began experiencing chest pain approx. 12 hours post vaccine. Patient did not report to the ER until 28Feb21. It was discussed that he has myocarditis v pericarditis, elevated D-Dimer of 770, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated Troponin. Patient was transferred to Research Medical Center due to no available beds. Patient was referred to a Case Manager and Cardiology. The patient completed a follow up appointment with 509 MDG on 9Mar21 and reported Dull pain that has been affecting sleep. Cardiology reports shows Troponin was elevated to 9.1 decreased to 4.2 and back up again to 13.4. Cardiac revealed late gadolinium enhancement, possibly representing myocarditis and then at discharge possibly myocarditis.

For the record, I tested positive for Covid in September 2020.  Upon arrival at the ER at Hospital, white cell count was 14.3 and creatinine levels were at a level that the doctors were not comfortable with. Diagnose with Acute Kidney Injury. Tested negative for Covid.  Admitted and started on fluids and antibiotics for an unknown infection.  Clear chest ex-ray and given blood thinners as a precaution.  By Sunday night in the hospital fever was at 104. By Monday midday, fever was finally lower at 100.9 and received another blood thinner shot.  White cell count was 11 at this point.  Doctors wanted me fever free for 24 hours before being discharged.  Blood work still showed an infection and white cell count was still not where they wanted, an infectious diseases doctor was called on Monday.  On Tuesday, March 30, temp was finally within a normal range, kidney function was improved and the infectious diseases doctor finally examined me and determined that this was a very rare reaction to the first dose  of Moderna vaccine due to previous positive Covid in September 2020 .

The pain proceeded to worsen over the next week and moderate lymphadenopathy was also been noted. These lymph nodes are tender to palpation. Additionally some Parasthesias were felt down the left forearm into the hand possibly due to brachial neuritis or nerve pressure due to lymphadenopathy.   The parasthesias lasted approximately 2 days.  Lymphadenopathy is now present in the right axilla along with more severe adenopathy in the left axilla.  - PA-S2

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.
