No Medical History information was reported.    On 22-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-May-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (Took a generic version of Miralax and had anaphylactic reaction and ended up in ER) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (Took a generic version of Miralax and had anaphylactic reaction and ended up in ER) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. Treatment information was not provided.  Company Comment: Based on the reporter&#39;s description of the event after taking Miralax and the temporal relationship occurring closer to Miralax dosing, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the reporter&#39;s description of the event after taking Miralax and the temporal relationship occurring closer to Miralax dosing, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                Patient received second Materna vaccine 5/28/2021 around 630 pm.  Around 10 PM felt fatigue and headache.  Felt very fatigued and unwell and slept most of 5/29 - 5/30. On 5/31, began experiencing chest discomfort radiating to left arm and palpitations.  Presented to hospital which was notable for abnormal EKG with diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions, troponin peak of 25.  TTE revealed low normal systolic function with EF 50%, no valvular disease or wall motion abnormalities.  Cardiac MRI revealed subepicardial delayed myocardial enhancement in the mid, apex lateral wall of the left ventricle and adjacent pericardium consistent with myopericarditis.  Patient was treated with colchicine and improved.  Infectious work-up for cardiotropic viruses were sent, viral swab was notable for positive rhinovirus/enterovirus.  Patient&#39;s presentation and timing of vaccine should be looked into as it is unclear wheter this presentation can be entirely due to presence of virus as above.  This is notably at least the second presentation of teenager with myopericarditis on this cardiology service in the past 2 weeks in setting of recent Covid vaccination.

The dorsa of his feet had a slightly raised, pruritic erythematous rash that, over the course of the day, extended in places near to the ankle. Though not warm to the touch, Patient explained that they felt hot and painful. There was slight swelling. By 1/24/21, there was less swelling, and discomfort and the erythematous rash had become eczematous in places and thicker than the previous day.  The palms didn&#39;t have an appreciable rash. However, Patient felt much discomfort there (not exactly painful) and some paresthesia. He felt that his fingers were swollen. By 1/24/21, the discomfort in both palms was worse.

Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

                                                After the vaccine I had a sore muscle at the vaccination site, but that went away after a day. 5 days after receiving my first Moderna vaccine, I noticed a swollen lymph node under my armpit on the same arm that I received the vaccine on (left armpit), but went to sleep not thinking anything of it. I woke up at 9am the next day to intense body aches and skin sensitivity and the lymph node even larger. The body aches have remained all day, but have subsided from rest. I went to my local urgent care center to get a Covid-19 rapid test and it came back negative.

He has been having hot and cold flashes since then.  He has had a poor appetite.  He has had a dry mouth and trouble sleeping.  One day prior to admission, he then developed a chest pain that became constant and persisted, so he came into the emergency department on 05/19/2021 for further care. He has developed myocarditis after receiving the first of his Moderna Coronavirus Disease 19 vaccines.

The fatigue started the day after the vaccine and lasted for about 4 days. The lymph nodes became swollen 3 days after the vaccine was administered and stayed swollen about one week. They were very sore, even turning the neck hurt, and this lasted for about 4-5 days.

                                                Admission HPI: Right-sided chest pain began 2 days prior to admission (3/19) after getting out of car, without identifiable trigger. Pain was sharp, pleuritic, and worst with movement; didn&#39;t feel it when still. Pain not responsive to ibuprofen or heating packs. Reported 30-60 seconds of self-resolving heart racing during ocular migraine which has been his baseline for years. Not associated with SOB (at rest or with exercise), palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. No viral URI symptoms, N/V, or rash. He did receive his 2nd Moderna COVID vaccine about 1 week PTA, followed by 36hrs of fevers, chills, and body aches. Given persistence of pain, Patient asked his parents to present to urgent care.   In UC, he was noted to tachycardic with CXR with bibasilar atelectasis and b/l effusions, per report. Given continued tachycardia, decision was made to transfer to ED to r/o PE.      In ED, tachycardic to 104-116 and tachypneic 22-26. Had one episode of tachycardia to 182 iso ocular migraine. Endorsed chest pain but points to R middle abdomen when asked where worst. Exam was unremarkable. He received 1 dose of morphine which reduced pain from 10/10 to 0/10. Labs notable for leukocytosis (14.61), thrombocytopenia (422), elevated d-dimer (1.56), and elevated CRP (5.6). Otherwise normal chem and coags. COVID/RVP negative. CXR unremarkable. CTPA showed scattered PEs in b/l lower lobes with small pulmonary infarct in RML. No evidence of right heart strain. Heme was consulted who recommended starting him on lovenox and sending lupus anti-coagulant. Cardiology was consulted who recommended EKG, BNP, and troponin, all of which were normal and reassuring against right heart strain. ECHO was therefore deferred to the AM. The decision was made to admit.   Upon arrival to the floor, Patient was tachycardic 114 and tachypneic to 22, otherwise stable vitals. He denied any pain since morphine. Denied any unexpected weight loss; reports that car ride was short. Mom reports that Patient has been less active d/t cold weather and baseball being on hold. Denies family or personal history of clots. Last seizure ~13 years ago.  Hospital Course: (3/21 - 3/22)  Patient was admitted to the hematology service. He was therapeutically anticoagulated with LMWH injections and his anti-Xa level prior to discharge was 0.92. (goal 0.5-1.0) Lower extremity ultrasound with Doppler showed patent veins and no evidence of DVT and upper extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT, though there was potential evidence of collateralization seen in mid and distal third of right subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Since this was an unprovoked PE, a full thrombophilia workup was sent and will be followed up by the outpatient hematology clinic. Cardiology consulted regarding possibility of right heart strain and the tachycardia during migraine episodes. Echocardiogram performed on 3/22 was technically limited but showed no gross abnormalities. The cardiology team requested a repeat echo scheduled outpatient for 1-2 months after discharge.

It started at 1 am, he had a pretty normal night, he went to bed and woke up vomiting, that continued through the night, the vomiting continued, he had a head ache, he called me and told me that his stomach really hurt, I told him to check his blood sugar, he also had  hot flashes, chills, and body aches, but mainly he had vomiting, then the next day 5/14/2021 he was getting more sleepy and less responsive, his friends tried to give him water and different things, his blood sugar went up, his friends took him that afternoon to the ER because he started not responding to me, his friends would tell me he was sleeping, so they took him to the ER, they found that he was very dehydrated, they were giving him fluids and did blood work, he was very unresponsive when he arrived, he could not answer his questions, he had a friend that was there that told them he had the vaccine, the blood work said he had a very high white blood cell count they were worried he had sepsis, they found his kidneys were not working ok, because his levels were very crazy and chest pain and severe stomach pain, and he had pancreatitis, they ruled out a heart attack, he then was admitted because he was in DKA, diabetic keto acidosis, like a result of his type 1 diabetes that got flared up because of all his reactions. They admitted him to the ICU and he was there until 05/16/2021 and basically they were just giving him fluids, potassium and other things to help his body calm down and stabilize his blood sugar. He was released and he still continues that his heart hurts but doctors say that these things resolve after a while.

Swelling of lymph nodes occurred around 18-24hrs after the vaccination and remained for about 5-7 days. This swelling resulted in varying levels of discomfort (worse in the days shortly after vaccination) when engaging the muscles and tendons around my armpit, feeling like the lymph node was being ?pulled?. Around 2 months after second vaccination (today), there is no pain or discomfort, but I can still feel the lymph node in my right armpit versus being unable to in my left armpit.

A ER note was  generated in a T-Con on a patient who got their 2nd Covid Vaccine and began experiencing chest pain approx. 12 hours post vaccine. Patient did not report to the ER until 28Feb21. It was discussed that he has myocarditis v pericarditis, elevated D-Dimer of 770, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated Troponin. Patient was transferred to Research Medical Center due to no available beds. Patient was referred to a Case Manager and Cardiology. The patient completed a follow up appointment with 509 MDG on 9Mar21 and reported Dull pain that has been affecting sleep. Cardiology reports shows Troponin was elevated to 9.1 decreased to 4.2 and back up again to 13.4. Cardiac revealed late gadolinium enhancement, possibly representing myocarditis and then at discharge possibly myocarditis.

This is a young man with no precious hx of this. Hospital would not entertain the idea this was related to the vaccine. Was discharged with instructions to return if worse in the AM. Continued high blood pressure and heart rate  for another 24 hrs. Swollen lymph nodes by the next day. Blood work in hospital showed immune response happening but again hospital would not attribute to vaccine.

                                                I?ve started getting a full body rash. The rash is pretty itchy with some minor swelling but not that bad overall. It?s not at all in my right arm where I got the shot, or in my left arm for that manner. It seems to be nearly entirely concentrated in my stomach region and especially my hands which are somewhat swollen.  This reaction is pretty similar to my Penicillin reaction albeit significantly stronger.

On the 6th day after the shot, swollen armpit/armpit pain started. Not severe enough to justify seeking medical help. Lapse in arm pain to armpit pain was surprising.

Patient reports normal postvaccination myalgias and fatigue for the last 2 days but had onset of left-sided chest pain that radiates to his upper back and is worse with deep inspiration, some positions and movement of his left upper extremity.  He denies cough, shortness of breath or rash.  He is low risk for pulmonary embolism with PERC score negative for PE.  Screening EKG showed a sinus rhythm with elevated J point in anterior-lateral leads, ? ST elevation in 1 and AVL w questionable reciprocal changes in leads 3 and AVF.  Patient went to CXR.  Clinically very low risk patient for STEMI from CAD.  ? Myocarditis or pericarditis?  No hx of stimulant use or early CAD in family.  Upon reevaluating the patient, clinically he seems to have musculoskeletal chest discomfort, worse with palpation and movement of LUE. Repeated EKG - showed more definative ST elevation through anterior and lateral leads with reciprocal changes in 2, 3, AVF.  Slight ST elevation in AVL.  ? Pericarditis vs myocarditis.     Will call cardiac alert.  Evolving EKG changes.  Discussed with ED physician and Interventional Cardiology, we agreed, patient likely has acute myocarditis clinically.  Very low risk for CAD.  Gave aspirin and heparin.  They will evaluate him.   Labs coming back... wbc 17.4, normal chemistry.  Sending off CRP, ESR.  Troponin pending.   Patient and family appreciative and understanding.   1710 - Follow up call from cardiology.  Stat echo normal wall motion.  With elevated CRP and mild trop 1.6, patient has myocarditis with pericarditis.  Dr very appreciative for the detailed history and physical.  CP free.  Holding off on cath lab.

                                                presented to the emergency room with symptoms of chest pain. He received Moderna covid vaccine on Tuesday and since then he has been having symptoms of myalgias and chest pain. He mentions that the chest pain is substernal, gets worse with deep breaths. It gets worse when he lays on his back.  And feels better when he sits up. He also had subjective fevers. When he presented to the emergency room he was having crushing chest discomfort with a troponin level at 10 and was referred for an emergent coronary angiography with concerns for acute coronary syndrome.  Diagnosis/Impression: Acute myocarditis after Covid vaccination: Based on positional changes and pleuritic nature of the chest pain. Given troponin level left hand and ongoing crushing chest discomfort he was emergently taken to the Cath Lab where he does not have any significant coronary artery disease or thrombotic occlusions. LV gram shows hyperdynamic LV systolic function. At this time his symptoms are consistent with myocarditis.

Performed my daily routines uneventfully other than just not feeling 100 percent. By that evening the chest pain returned. On 4/18, I awoke with severe chest pains. I then presented to the ER where was presumed I was having a heart attack vs. acute pericarditis/myocarditis.

                                                * Tuesday, March 16th, I received my first Moderna shot. No immediate symptoms, felt fine. * Thursday, March 25th (9 days post-vaccination), I was sitting at my desk and experienced some kind of visual distortion (my computer monitor bounced up and down 4 times in quick succession, even though I was perfectly still). Got up from my desk and laid down, and it went away. * Tuesday, March 30th (two weeks post-vaccination), I started experiencing persistent dizziness/imbalance. It was manageable for the first couple of days, and I still went about my daily activities. * Thursday, April 1st, symptoms got noticeably worse. I had a really bad episode of vertigo/dizziness in the afternoon. This spell of bad symptoms lasted until Saturday evening/Sunday morning. I wasn?t falling down, but I would describe it as akin to being on a boat in rough seas or a plane flying through a storm. Pressure in head and ears was intense. I?ve had longstanding tinnitus, but pitch/volume definitely seemed to change somewhat. My neck was incredibly stiff, and my throat felt somewhat ?tight? (tonsils or lymph nodes in neck felt enlarged). Took ibuprofen and Benadryl on and off over next several days. * Tuesday, April 27th, symptoms are ongoing. Still having imbalance, dizziness, and non-spinning vertigo, though less severe than previously.

                                                Patient is 22 year-old, admitted to the Cardiology 3  Emergency Department with acute myocarditis shortly following the receipt of his 2nd Moderna COVID-19 vaccination.   He has a remote history of acute pericarditis (01/12/2014) following viral illness, which was treated with high dose ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d.  At that time, he presented with retrosternal chest pain worse with laying down and fever/myalgia, rigors and chills (T 103.3°F) with laboratory findings consistent with leukocytosis 17.3, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 43, but normal ESR 12) with a negative influenza screen.  ECG demonstrated diffuse ST wave elevations in leads I, II, aVF, V1-V6.  He had resolution of symptoms with NSAID treatment.   On this occasion, he presented with non-radiating retrosternal chest pain not responding to Ibuprofen 800 mg.  At the ED, ECG demonstrated diffuse ST elevation, troponinemia 629/725/712/1319, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 38.2, ESR 19).  He had normal D-dimer and SARS-CoV-2 PCR was undetected.  A cardiac MRI was obtained that demonstrated patchy subepicardial enhancement in the mid-apical lateral-anterolateral myocardium, suggestive of myocarditis.  EKG showed diffuse ST elevation.  He was treated with Toradol and fentanyl for pain management with improvement of symptoms.  He was then admitted to Cardiology 3 for further evaluation and management.   Upon admission, Infectious Disease was consulted given the novelty of his presenting symptoms and findings.  Extensive evaluation including connective tissue cascade, respiratory viral panel and tick bone panel have not yielded any significant findings.  They suspected this could be related to his recent COVID vaccine given that there have been reports of myocarditis that have occurred following COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccinations, though it is not clear whether there is a definite cause or effect.  Moreover, the association of myocarditis and the messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccinations appears to be controversial, not supported by recent FDA reports.  All in all, the Infectious Disease team recommended no specific therapies, but the case should be reported as a possible adverse event associated with the recent Moderna vaccination to VAERS.  The center where the patient received this vaccination should make this report. Emergency Management Director was notified to report the event.  They also felt that it may be reasonable to avoid the Moderna and perhaps even the Pfizer messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccination in the future to be conservative.   While inpatient, his troponin level continued to trend up and peaked at 1707.  An EKG was repeated and showed improvement in ST elevation from his initial EKG with no other acute changes.  His case was discussed with Dr., who felt that a steroid taper would be appropriate.  Additional chest pain was treated with PRN Ibuprofen 600 mg QID.  After initiation of steroids, troponin markedly improved to 706.  Due to his history of impaired fasting glucose, his blood glucose levels were monitored q.i.d.  While slightly elevated, he did not require any sliding scale insulin while inpatient.  We will plan to have his primary care provider assess his glucose level at his follow-up visit.  Additionally, while receiving NSAIDs and steroids, his blood pressure was elevated to the 150s to 160 systolic.  He was initiated on Coreg prior to dismissal.   He was dismissed on 04/29/2021 given improving troponin and no concerning arrhythmias on continuous telemetry monitoring.  He will follow up in the Cardiomyopathy Clinic in 3 months with a repeat cardiac MRI and stress ECG.  We have recommended the patient to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the next 3 months until seen by the cardiomyopathy Clinic.  He was provided with education and a letter delineating work restrictions.

                                                A couple of hours after my fist dose Moderna vaccine, my left arm began to hurt, I also developed headaches, body aches and left arm swelling. At 1am-2am, I could not move my left arm and my fever was 103.3F. I contacted urgent care who told me to take Ibuprofen as pain medication.  My symptoms did decrease although I still have today difficulty sleeping and sweat at night which I did not have before the vaccine.

                                                23 yo man in high school when standing, admitted wit acute onset epigastric abdominal pain after a run, found to have mild elevation in troponin, flat at 0.04, dynamic EKG changes admitted or work-up  1. Acute epigastric abdominal pain/elevated troponin: The patient was chest pain free from the time of treatment with Pepcid, magic mouthwash, and Toradol in ED. His echo is without wall motion abnormalities, troponin is flat and remains chest pain free. The patient had a CT PE protocol study and CTA coronary without acute findings. He had a cardiac MRI which showed no acute myocarditis but may have had some delayed contrast enhancement and may represent prior myocarditis. He was started on low dose lisinopril 2.5 mg po daily for cardio-protection, will reduce physical activity with slow return to activity, and follow with cardiology with an urgent exercise stress test as an outpatient. His u tox shows cannabinoids and no other intoxicants, His lipid panel wnl, HDL 65, LDL 84, His TSH is wnl. His CRP and ESR is wnl.    2. Left axillary lymphadenopathy: Discussed with patient lymph nodes seen on CT scan in left axilla and left pectoral region. Patient cofnirmed he had a COVID 19 Moderna vaccine in the left arm on 4/3/2021. Epic documentation notes in the right axilla, but patient is clear that he had the vaccine in the left arm. Axillary lymphadenopathy is not surprising in this situation.   3. Small 4 mm nodules noted on CT scan: The patient had no infectious symptoms, no cough, no fever, and no elevated WBC. He does smoke marijuana but has no tobacco use. He can follow with PCP to further risk stratify the nodules, either with PPD, and consideration of repeat scan in 6-12 months as needed.   4. Mild bilateral gynecomastia: I informed patient this has been found. He is not bothered by this finding and it seems an incidental finding. He can follow with his PCP for further evaluation as needed for this finding.   Inpatient Consultants and summary of recommendations: 1.

                                                Arm soreness/aches started about 6hrs in (though injection sight was tender/sensitive to the touch pain became mostly localized around the armpit and shoulder area. Where the pectoral connects under the arm), then around 8hrs a headache and chills started. Chills and headache progressed and got significantly worse throughout the night.  By around18hrs headache had progressed to a migraine and nausea started (likely due to the migraine). Simply sitting up in bed was enough to push nausea to vomiting at which the migraine subsided for about 30min-1hr. Chills and aching arm persisted.  By 24hrs headache/migraine was nearly completely gone and chills had subsided. Arm pain persisted and got worse. Noticed around this time that there seemed to be mild swelling in the armpit. Around 48hrs in armpit area is still feels slightly swollen and causes a good bit a pain depending on how arm moves/rests. Injection sight still lightly tender. (currently the only symptom persisting)

The pain proceeded to worsen over the next week and moderate lymphadenopathy was also been noted. These lymph nodes are tender to palpation. Additionally some Parasthesias were felt down the left forearm into the hand possibly due to brachial neuritis or nerve pressure due to lymphadenopathy.   The parasthesias lasted approximately 2 days.  Lymphadenopathy is now present in the right axilla along with more severe adenopathy in the left axilla.  - PA-S2

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

                                                About 4 hours after dose, started to have a flat, non-itchy rash develop on chest and upper abdomen. Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.

                                                I woke up with pressure on my chest and pain on my left arm around the elbow. After a couple of minutes, I began to have a lot of cold sweat, and both the pressure in my chest and pain in my arm began to increase. Then I began feeling a tingling sensation on my neck/chin. After that, I felt lightheaded and decided to go to the hospital. At my arrival to the ER, I was given aspirin and heparin. I got a couple of EKGs and a chest X-Ray, as well as some blood work. I was then transferred to the medical center, where I had some more blood tests and EKGs done. I was also treated with Indocin, Lipitor and Aspirin. At around 9PM, I began feeling the pressure on my chest again, although with decreased intensity. I was given morphine and the pain went away. This event repeated at around 10AM next morning with the same outcome. After that I got an Echocardiogram, and began to be treated with Metoprolol. No other pain events happened for the rest of my stay at the hospital. On the next morning, April 26th, I was taken to an angiogram to rule out Coronary Dissection. After the test, I was discharged with a prescription for Metoprolol.

The fever, chills, headache, and nausea have subsided, but body aches remain.  I am also still experiencing what I believe to be swollen lymph nodes around my collar bone.

                                                Mild Chest pain began to occur roughly a week after vaccination. Two weeks after vaccination it had processed to severe bouts of pain accompanied with dizziness and fatigue. After about a week of severe pain, the pain began to taper off and seemed to move from my chest more into my armpit and arm. A swollen and painful lymph node occurred in my left armpit roughly 2 weeks after severe pain had started. The lymph node is currently still swollen but it&#39;s getting mildly better. Chest pain is not entirely gone but it&#39;s also getting better slowly.
