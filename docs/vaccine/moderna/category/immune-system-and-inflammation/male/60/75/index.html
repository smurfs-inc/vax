Two days later developed swelling and lymphadenopathy on same side for several days treated with NSAID&#39;s to help with inflammatory response.  It is better now but some minor swelling still present but mostly resolved.

At 7:06 am I noticed  left side facial swelling and slightly obstructed throat.  Swelling worsened only slightly from 7am to 9am. At 9am I took 100mg Benadryl and withing 45 minutes swelling was subsiding and breathing was normal. Arrived at ER at around 11:am. Was treated with EPINEPHrine, methylPREDNISolone and saline IV. Released after a few hours

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

                                                Injection was put in the fatty tissue and not in the actual muscle tissue  - it may have been administered too low in my arm. Everything was fine for first five days - and I noticed where the shot mark was and I noticed a lighter ring around it and about 3 or 4 days later - ring around it that was four inches in size- it was warm to the touch; swollen. Inner part was bright red and about five inches out it was lighter - it looked like an infection. I sent a photo to my doctor and asked him and was put on antibiotic  - about a week - just in case. It may have helped a little - after the antibiotics, I could still see it was there (although no swelling anymore).

                                                Patient with prior Covid infection Nov 2020, fully recovered, received first dose Moderna vaccine on 3/13/21 and next day developed body aches, fevers, chills, shortness of breath. Admitted 3/17/21 due to hypoxia, had ground glass opacities on CT. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x 2.  Vigorous immune response could have caused lung inflammation and hypoxia, similar to a covid infection, but from the vaccine. 60YM with a history of a chronic inflammatory arthritis on methotrexate, hospitalization in November 2020 with Covid pneumonia, he was discharged on 1 to 2 L of home oxygen, and reports that he was told by his PCP about a month after discharge that he was able to come off the oxygen as his oxygen saturations had normalized.  He returned to his usual state of health and activity with no issues until he received the first dose of his Moderna covid-19 vaccine through his primary care office on 3/13.  The next day he developed arm pain and then progressive body aches, headaches, fevers, chills, and shortness of breath.  He presented to the ER and was found to be febrile with hypoxia and admitted for treatment and evaluation.   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with ground glass opacities on CT : oxygen 87% on RA in ER, 84% on room air 3/19, resolves with oxygen support of 2lpm.  CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x2 as well as respiratory virus panel, CT shows ground glass opacities, patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline for empiric treatment for possible community-acquired pneumonia, although procalcitonin was negative.  BNP was elevated at 458, so an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal EF, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was given 2 doses of furosemide during the hospitalization and BNP normalized. Patient was started on prednisone to calm down a possible inflammatory response triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine in a person who likely already has antibodies, causing hypoxia.  With this patient significantly improved and at discharge is on room air at rest, but still requires 2 L/min with exertion.  CRP was markedly elevated, supporting an inflammatory process.  Autoimmune lung disease panel was sent and is in process at time of discharge.  Patient requested discharge home, Discharged on a slow prednisone taper to avoid rebound with abrupt discontinuation of steroids.  Patient will complete 2 additional days of Augmentin and doxycycline at discharge.

Pain when closing mouth resulting in some drooling from keeping mouth open.  Also some nasal drainage and feeling of unwell.  Telehealth appointment occurred on 1/8/21.

                                                About a day after the vaccine, (Thursday) I developed a mild headache and mild general aches . These resolved quickly. But  about Friday, my  right hand began to ache a bit. It became excruciating by Sunday.  My right elbow and my right ribs also hurt, but the joints in my right hand were on fire. I could not open, close, or flex it without severe joint pain. It was sore even to the touch especially at the joints.  The hand appeared to be a bit swollen as well. I took ibuprofen and it helped a bit. By Monday morning it was much better, but my hand still aches some.

                                                Facial swelling and slight lip swelling and redness to skin which began about 90 minutes after the vaccination.  He was seen in an emergency room and treated with diphenhydramine, famotidine and prednisone and discharged on the same. He improved in the ER but reports that he had recurrent facial swelling over the next few days when antihistamine wore off.  Resolved after a few days.  Seen in the office on 3/18/21 and doing fine off medication.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and a few weeks later he noticed jaundice and hematuria. He was admitted to the Hospital, and was noted to have dramatically elevated eosinophils (26.29 k/uL), elevated creatinine (2.36 mg/dL) and elevated LFTs (AST/AST/Alk Phos/Tbili all up, mostly direct). His eosinophils improved with pulse dose steroids and the diagnostic work up continues. There is diagnostic uncertainty about what caused this dramatic increase in eosinophilia, but it appears temporally related to getting the vaccination. Our working diagnosis is autoimmune vasculitis, but he is also being treated for possible parasitic infection, and will require very close follow-up. 61M with PMHx HTN p/w generalized fatigue, L flank pain, and decreased UOP.   He was in his usual state of health until 5 days prior to admission with onset of general fatigue/sluggishness. This was followed by a few days of dull abdominal pain, watery bowel movements, and increased frequency which spontaneously resolved, though the fatigue persisted. Yesterday evening, he noticed new L flank pain, red urine, and decreased UOP associated with mild dysuria (he describes it as needle-like pain in his urethra) which prompted him to call EMS. Denies fevers/chills/night sweats, myalgias, respiratory symptoms, melena/hematochezia. He&#39;s never had pyelonephritis or kidney stones before, no recent urinary instrumentation, antibiotic use, or hospital stays.    He recently received the first COVID vaccine and is due for the second COVID shot on Monday. He lives with his sister and works as a mechanic. He is not on any other medications or supplements. Not currently sexually active.

Notably has been afebrile and fairly well appearing. Symptoms were preceded by several days of watery diarrhea, cough with sputum production and subjective weight loss. Recently received moderna vaccine, and he was concerned it causes his symptoms.  Underwent extensive workup as below with involvement of multiple services including Renal, Pulm, Rheum, Allergy, ENT, and Cardiology. Had one nasal lesion biopsied by ENT, which was non-diagnostic. Renal bx prelim without clear e/o vaculitis, although obtained after steroids. Negative testing for primary hypereosinophilic syndrome. Extensive w/u notable for ANCA positive at 1:80 with  MPO only slightly elevated (20, uln 19) and PR3 wnl.  cMRI with eosinophilic cardiomyopathy, for which cards was consulted as below. Additionally, toxacara ab positive and schistosoma ab indeterminate, although per ID both schistosomiasis and toxacara infection unlikely. Per rheum, overall felt presentation 2/2 hypereosinophilic syndrome, potentially the eosinophilic stage of EGPA (given low &#43; ANCA, low &#43; MPO) vs.  End organ effects of idiopathic eosinophilia. Briefly received CTX 2g IV qd (4/10 - 4/12) until diagnostics returned. Treated with solumedrol 1g qd x3d (4/11-4/13) transitioned to prednisone 60 mg qd (4/14-) to be continued until rheum f/u, with rapid decline in eosinophilia. Received pre-treatment with PO ivermectin 20 mg before steroids. Treated with flonase nasal spray, symbicort and albuterol for respiratory symptoms. Deferred cyclophosphamide, with consideration of IL-5 or IL-5R targeted biologics as an outpatient. Treated with atovaquone for PCP ppx. Per ID, treated with praziquantel (for schistosomiasis) and albendazole (for toxacara) out of an abundance of caution, although low c/f visceral larva migrans given lack of compatible imaging findings and no known exposure to dogs and cats or schistosomiasis given remove travel history.

Baseline Cr unknown but Cr was 1.5 (OSH BI) and urine alb:Cr was elevated to 36 in 6/2018, at which time CKD was thought to be 2/2 untreated HTN. Now presented with persistent hematuria, HTN and proteinuria with UCx without e/o infection, all favoring nephritic process. Renal and urology consulted MALB/CCR 994.5. CT scan with hydronephrosis, felt to be eosinophilic pyelonephritis. Pt underwent uncomplicated renal bx 4/14 (after steroids) which showed preliminary very mild focus of interstitial nephritis with scattered eosinophils and immunofluorescence evidence suggestive of a mild immune complex-mediated disease without current activity. EM pending. He was treated with sodium bicarb 1300 mg bid. Hematuria improved but did not resolved by time of discharge. Cr on discharge 1.6, close to baseline of 1.5 in 2018.    #Sclera Icterus #CBD Dilation on CT #Elevated LFT Sclera icteric and CBD dilation on RUQUS to 1.8cm with gallbladder sludge and small gallstones. MRCP with diffuse intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation to the level of ampulla, with associated ductal and gallbladder wall edema, complex material in the gallbladder lumen and CBD, and confluent periportal lymphadenopathy. No obstructing stone or discrete mass. Findings likely represent cholangitis such as eosinophilic cholangitis in light of severe eosinophilia.. No documented LFTs here, but OSH (BI) records indicate normal LFTs and viral hepatitis studies in 6/2018. Repeat Hep B non-reactive non immune, HCV non immune, HAV non-reactive.  BIli remained stable and ALT and AST continued to rise after initiation of steroids. GI was consulted. RUQUS 4/15 with dopplers with persistently dilated CBD to 1.4 cm with sludge in CBD but with patent portal vein and hepatic veins. Anti smooth muscle ab positive on day of discharge; antimitochondrial ab pending. LFT uptrending at time of discharge, although patient declined to stay inpatient for further workup. LFT at discharge ALT 194, AST 114, ALP 262, TBili 6.3, DBili 5.3. ERCP to be considered as an outpatient.     #HTN SBP on admission 160-180. History of HTN, not on any home anti-hypertensives. Per BI records, he was prescribed amlodipine 10/valsartan 160 in 6/2019, but pt reports self-discontinuation after ~2 doses. BP remains poorly controlled. Likely related to potential nephritic syndrome or renal infiltration by eosinophils, likely with contribution of high dose steroids. While inpatient, treated with hydralazine, labetalol, carvedilol, and amlodipine. BP regimen on discharge amlodipine 10 mg qd, carvedilol 25 mg qd. Avoiding ARBs and ACEI per Renal, although will likely need to add once AKI resolved.    #Microcytic Anemia Patient with drop in Hct from 14.1 on admission to 11.4 4/14. Continues with hematuria, but denies current hematochezia. Suspect combination of blood loss and hypopoliferation given RPI 0.29, likely anemia of inflammation/acute illness given ferritin 1.010. Vitamin B12 &gt;2000, Folate 11. Iron 151, unable to calculate TIBC. Noted to have persistently low MCV in low 70. Hemoglobin electrophoresis ordered.    #Vitamin D deficiency #HyperPTH 25-OH Vitamin D 6. No e/o hypocalcemia. Phos slightly elevated on admission, but subsequently downtrending, likely iso renal dysfunction. Treated with ergocalciferol 50,000 U weekly x12 weeks   #Right mandible lesion Sclerotic changes of the right mandible near the condyle noted on CT scan. Surgeon recommends outpatient follow-up, although patient declined.    #Hematochezia #Hemorrhoids Patient with new bloody diarrhea 4/11. Some e/o hemorrhoids on exam. CBC stable. Treated with tucks pads, dibucaine ointment and hydrocortisone cream.   #Little Medical Follow-up Pt reports that he has not seen a doctor in ~3 years.Cholesterol 124l LDL 73, HDL 10. HgbA1c 5.2. Will join Dr&#39;s panel on discharge   #CHIP mutation  RHP with DNMT3A mutation at low VAF. Will follow in cancer precursor clinic

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, the symptoms started with a stiff neck and headache on the left side including soreness at the injection site. As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.   As a school teacher, I have taken the appropriate precautions and received a Covid19 test: Results negative.

                                                Extensive DVT requiring surgery. Received second Moderna vaccine approximately one week prior to admission, presented with acute onset of left leg swelling and pain.  Left lower extremity ultrasound demonstrated an extensive deep venous thrombosis extending from the common femoral vein into the peritoneal and posterior tibial vein with a patent IVC.  He was given a treatment dose of enoxaparin and admitted to the hospitalist service.  Overnight he developed diminished sensation in his toes and vascular surgery was consulted.  On 3/31/2021 he underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the left superficial femoral and common femoral veins as well as stenting of the left common iliac vein stent.  Of note he was noted to have May Thurner physiology with compression of the left common iliac vein by the external iliac artery on the right.  Post procedurally the patient&#39;s swelling and edema was significantly improved.  He did not have any significant pain or difficulty ambulating.  On postoperative day #1 he was evaluated and found to be hemodynamically stable with improvement of his symptoms and stable for discharge home.  Prior to discharge it was discussed with the patient that he will need to be on a loading dose of Eliquis for 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg twice daily. No h/o COVID.

                                                Initial presenting symptoms upon awakening four days after his shot were muscle spasms, &#34;felt things in his chest,&#34; and dark urine. Within 48 he was confused and was unable to state his last name, which progressed to unresponsiveness by ~7 days after the vaccine. He has since become comatose and his brain MRI is notable for hyperintensity involving the deep gray nuclei as well as the periventricular and subcortical white matter diffusely, bilaterally. The etiology of his comatose state is still under investigation, but a detailed infectious, autoimmune, and malignancy work up at 2 different medical centers and have since been unrevealing as to alternate causes.

Medical history included treatment for tuberculosis and dialysis. Concomitant medication included calcium acetate, Renvela, glipizide, omeprazole, aspirin, vitamin D, losartan, furosemide, rifampin, and Sensipar.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 030L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13 Jan2021, the patient tested negative for COVID-19). On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, and feeling weird/funny. On 17Jan2021, the patient experienced difficulty breathing and swelling. On 18 Jan 2021, the patient declined dialysis, was tired and wanted to lay down. At 8 am, the patient was found nonresponsive and cold and is believed to have passed away around 4 am. The coroner tested the deceased for COVID-19 and the test was positive. No autopsy was reported. No death certificate was issued at the time of the report but the reporter believes it will list cause of death as COVID complications.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events of limb discomfort, feeling abnormal, dyspnea, fatigue, swelling, unresponsive to stimuli, body temperature abnormal, was fatal.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient was died. Cause of death was COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events developed on four days after first dose of mRNA-1372. Dyspnea, unresponsive to stimuli, and death were consistent with infection in pandemic set up confounded by age of patient and refusal of dialysis Cause of death was reported as COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided. Based on reporter&#39;s causality the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19

                                                Patient is meeting diagnostic criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome post-vaccination.   He received his 1st Moderna COVID vaccination on 12/31/2020 (037K20A) and his second COVID vaccination on 2/5/21 (029L20A).  He began developing high grade fevers on 1/22/21 and was admitted to our facility on 2/8/21 due to &#34;fever of unknown etiology&#34; associated with hepatitis and coagulopathy on laboratory studies.  He underwent an extensive evaluation which failed to reveal any other infectious, rheumatologic, or hematologic explanation for his clinical syndrome.  He was ultimately discharged to outpatient care with ongoing supportive care for his fevers.  His liver associated enzymes were improving at discharge.

First time was full face swelling about 51 hours after vaccine and and 20 hours after eating lobster and other shellfish pasts dinner. (63 and never been allergic to shellfish before) on Saturday. First swelling went down slowly and gone within 24 hours. Following Tuesday, woke to swelling/numbness of lower right mouth &amp; lip. Lessened throughout day. Thursday, woke to upper left and upper right lips numb and swollen. Lessened throughout day. Today, woke to lower left lip numb and swollen like I?d been punched in mouth. Wife insisted I go see doctor immediately.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine:  I was recovering from a mild sprained ankle/foot  for about a week.  At the time of vaccination I had very little pain and could easily put full weight on the foot.  About 13 hours after the injection, I awoke to a throbbing foot and severe pain in that foot.  I could no longer apply any weight to it and it exhibited considerable swelling.  I visited the doctor and am now resting, icing, compressing, and elevating the foot.  Diclofenac Sodium was prescribed for pain.  Vaccine induced stimulation of an inflammation response is a possible explanation.

I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

Into the evening I started getting beyond normal reaction.  I had a very stiff shoulder joint with pain, beyond that of my existing condition.  It was severe the next day.  Saw my doctor, for the first time meet, and mentioned the reaction I got, but he said it will go away.  During the doctor visit I had elevated BP identified, which wasn&#39;t normal for me either.  That evening I had additional symptoms that included swelling at the proximal points on the thumb and index finger, this also included the wrist.  All symptoms have since subsided to normal.  No other symptoms.

                                                I am allergic to polyethylene glycol ?  it actually put me in the hospital for years ago. I had no idea it was in the vaccine, although a smaller amount than I had taken before. I started experiencing severe and awful anxiety and panic that night I got the vaccine. I had other minor side effects that were expected but they went away within a day. Several days later, I began experiencing pain in both my bilateral Achilles tendons and bilateral knee pain. A physical therapist examined both and said that I was swollen. I have had both of those problems under control for a very long time. I am improving somewhat  but nearly 2 weeks later I am still having some repercussions. I am now scared and don&#39;t know if I should get the second injection done because the previous adverse symptoms were awful. Thank you.

                                                I developed a swollen lymph node in my right side neck just under lower jaw at rear. This presented itself as strong jaw pain like a bad cavity and soreness at the lymph node. I have a sore throat and have not been able to hardly chew or swallow without pain. This is still going on as of 3/3/21 but seems to be easing up a bit. I have a Dr. appointment on 2/9/21 to check it out.

Cough and sob worse over the last 5 d or so, sleeping in recliner, and having trouble sleeping.  Though no desat on march test, he has freq intermittent coughing and he was tachycardic to 110 on exam this am.&#34;   Pt states symptoms worsening over past week. No symptoms at rest. With exertion has anterior chest tightness and dyspnea. No radiation of pain or migration. He can walk usual distances but much slower. Improved at rest. Cannot lay flat at night. Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

                                                Seen at the walk-In clinic on 3/9/2021 where he presented with complaints of right leg weakness, numbness, and tingling.  He was transferred to ER for further evaluation and management.    The symptoms (numbness in his hip and thigh) began around 1400 while he was working.  He went about his day. The symptoms progressively worsened while he was ambulating around the hardware store. In the ER, his sensation of his right leg was dulled as compared to the left. The numbness extended from his hip to his toes. Felt a pressure-like sensation in his thigh and calf.  Denies pain. Felt as though his right foot is floating 2 inches off the ground when standing with both feet on the ground. Reported his right leg is 1-2 inches shorter after a femur fracture many years ago. Nothing made his symptoms better or worse.  Did have an episode of feeling generally hot and then cold the evening prior to admission. Denied any trauma.     Denied any dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stools, urinary habit changes, hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, myalgias, arthralgias, recent illness, or fever.   MRI showed T2 changes on the right side of the cord down of the thoracic spine concerning for her transverse myelitis.  Patient did have Covid vaccine 7 days prior to onset of symptoms, one dose mRNA vaccine.    He is on day 3 high-dose methylprednisolone thousand milligrams IV ×3 days.  He has noticed an improvement in the pressure sensation from the knee up the thigh on the right, no longer having tingling in the right lower leg or the left foot.  He is still having numbness over the anterior right thigh.  Yesterday when he went to bear weight on the right heel, he had a sharp pain with increase in weakness.  That has since settled down.  He did have a few involuntary myoclonic movements as described yesterday.  This writer reached out on 3/22/2021 for information on his Vaccine lot number. He stated &#34;At this point I am attending physical therapy, I am walking with the aid of crutches or a walker. There is improvement in the foot and lower leg regarding the numbness, but the upper thigh is still pretty much completely numb yet.&#34;

                                                Patient presented to our facility due to progressive swelling of his LLE. Patient is an avid cyclist and reports he began training again for the spring season approx. 1 mo ago.  He had L calf tightness present for a few weeks as well as slightly painful knees which he attributed to his age and mild deconditioning over the winter.  He traveled with infrequent stops on 4/2/2021 to visit family.  He continued to have discomfort and increasing ankle pain, thus presented to ER.  LE ultrasound venous dopplers performed showing extensive DVT: L femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal veins.  CT also demonstrated acute PE w/in distal R and L main pulm artery and w/in bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulm arteries involving all the lobes.  Patient had remote history of LE DVT in 2017 after  mild bumping of leg and placed on Xarelto for 6 mo. Had genetic testing completed at that time which was negative. He has had no clotting issues since. ( Received Moderna COVID-19 vaccines on 2/3/21 and 3/3/21. Reports brain fog and fatigue approx. 20 hours after vaccination followed by the above.) Patient discharged on rivaroxaban.

He discharged to home and was doing very well. Tuesday, 4/6/2021, he received the second Covid vaccine. The following morning, he had pain in his right ankle. It progressed and involved his left foot and ankle.  Over the next few days his pain progressed to involve his legs, but stopped at the knees. He had leg weakness and associated diarrhea, fever and chills. He thought his symptoms would pass and tried to wait it out over the weekend. When he awoke on Monday morning, 4/12/21, he could not move his feed. He went to the ER and was diagnosed with Guillain Barre Syndrome.. He received 5 doses of IVIG with very good response. Patient states his leg strength is improving, but is not back to baseline. His arms are unaffected by his Guillain-Barre. He is in Rehabilitation now.

He went to the dentist the next morning who diagnosed him with parotiditis. He also saw a NP at his PCP office that afternoon. He was started on Augmentin and took ibuprofen with improvement of symptoms. Symptoms were mostly resolved by 1/31.  It is unclear if this was related to the vaccine, but given the timeline decided to report it.

Due to swelling and pain, I could not grasp with that hand.   That evening, I used ibuprofen and Aleve.  The swelling and pain was better in the morning of the next day.   Forty-eight hours after onset, the hand was essentially back to normal.

                                                On 3/22/2021, 7 days after I received the second shot, after supper at ~6:00 PM, I felt pain from right feet below the ankle. The pain got worse by 8:00 pm. I though I might somehow got it hurt somewhere.  I massage the pain area and place the foot and lower leg in a bucket   filled with warm water. Those did not help. I went to bed at ~8:30 pm and felt the whole right leg  very uncomfortable. The dull pain came from the foot and extended to the whole leg,  I felt the foot and leg were swelling but they were not. By 12:00 am the pain became less and totally gone by 7:00 am, I urinated four times over night and had severe sweating in the second half of the night.   I  feel alright the next day, just some kind joint/musel  uncomfortable.

                                                He got his vaccine, within 24 hours later he had hives, his lips and face swelled up, he had a low grade temp of 99.8 having chills and wanting to stay warm and lay in bed with multiple  blankets.  After his daughter noticed it about 2 hours later they went to the ER, and they gave him a steroid, Benadryl and a steroid and gave him IV Pepcid until the swelling went down and he felt better.   They gave him 6 days worth of Benadryl, and steroids which he did take for that.  After 6 days and after 24 hours he broke again in the same manner and they told him that it was okay as long as he was breathing well.  He then went to the UC and he bought OTC Benadryl which he continued.  Then exactly 30 days after he went to the ER on 4/24/21 he broke again with the lips swelling, hives, temperature was normal but feeling achy and the same symptoms he had from the beginning.  He went to his PCP and he has him now on steroids, Benadryl and the Pepcid when needed as well.  He takes the Benadryl as needed and then the symptoms subside and the reaction comes back.   If he does not do the Benadryl until later this evening then his lips will start tightening and then swell.

The first shot I had a bad rash 14 days after receiving the vaccine.  This was treated with Benadryl and hydrocortisone and within two weeks, it was almost gone. Therefore, I was advised by my doctor to get the 2nd shot in the other arm.  Within 24 hours of the second shot, the same rash broke out from shoulder to elbow that happened after the first shot. In addition, at the same time, my right armpit gland became very swollen and sensitive to the touch.  Doctor advised to again use Benadryl for 48 hours and hyrdocortisone.

He wasn&#39;t able to speak for 3 days.  On 2/17/2021 he went to the hospital.  They thought he may have Bell&#39;s Palsy so the they did a XRAY and CT.  They were not able to find anything other than facial swelling so he was discharged and told to come back if he did not get better and they would make him an appt w/ an ENT.  He started taking Aleve.  He no longer has constant pain but his mouth still hurts when he opens it.  He will contact his PCP to let her know what happened and to let her know that he will not be taking his 2nd covid vax dose.

                                                I got an immediate headache in my temple from the shot. That evening I developed fatigue, chills, sore throat, swollen (throat) glands. Woke up the next day feeling all of those plus coughing and sinus congestion/draining. Went to urgent care the following day and tested negative for Covid and flu. Returned to urgent care on Saturday for a chest xray and was diagnosed with pneumonia.

                                                The morning after first  vaccination I noticed tightness and inflammation in the lymph  nodes  in my underarm area.  Days  later muscle inflammation  throughout my arm  progressively worst  accompanied by occasional tingling  in the fingers,  After the second week  I had a virtual  office visit with  my PPC doctor who said  this was a common side effect and so I just let it take its  course.  After my second shot  (2/15/) the same  feelings have occurred but  even more acute.  Keeping me awake at night etc.

Pt was found to have elevated BTNP at 2240 pg/ml with fluid overload, and Biofire Respiratory Panel showed Coronavirus PCR positive.  At that time, his COVID markers were also elevated.  CRP 91.4 mg/L,  D-Dimer 2340 ng/mL.  Patient was admitted, diuresed, and started on inpatient COVID protocol which included Ivermectin.  March 9:  EKG was performed and patient was found to have a heart block.  All labs had improved over the past 48 hrs. BTNP reduced to 1530, D-Dimer reduced to  1700, CRP reduced to 47.9.   Due to the heart block, patient was transferred to a care center to a cardiologist.  Just prior to transfer, a follow up Biofire respiratory panel showed Coronavirus PCR NEGATIVE.  PCR positive and negative results were relayed to accepting facility - facility and they were going to refer to epidemiology for follow up.

Yesterday, 3/11/21 the injection site area went to itching, and then he noticed a pretty good swelling in that area, and now the swelling is fairly deep, 3/4&#34; high and about 3&#34; across, about as big as 1/2 the size around as a baseball and sticks up about an inch.  It&#39;s red to touch.  His son is a nurse and told him some remedies for the symptoms.   He has taken some ibuprofen for it as well, which did not do anything for the swelling.

                                                4 hours after injection, my left arm from my bicep to my elbow was giving me excruciating pain (10&#43; on a  scale of 1-10).  Impossible to sleep despite Tylenol to try to relieve the pain.  By morning, 30 March, the pain subsided to a 1 on the same scale, but my arm swelled up from my bicep all the way to my hand and today, 4 1/2 days later, it is still swollen.  My primary care doctor is sending me for a sonogram on Monday or Tuesday to discern if there is any underlying damage.

                                                Ongoing issues with migrating joint and muscle aches. Initially I took  advil. After 2 weeks my GP prescribed a medrol dose pak that got rid of symptoms immediately and for the duration of the treatment. When the meds were over the symptoms came back to a lesser degree. The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

                                                The patient noted weakness starting in the legs on January the 19th, 10 days  after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.  The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

HCP approached vehicle where a 68yo white male was sitting in his vehicle on the driver side. Quick assessment revealed erythema of the face and angioedema. Pt was able to speak clearly, was CTA and had RRR. 911 was called. BP 160/90.  EpiPen dose 1 was injected into right vastus lateralis and pt reported improvement at 1057.  HCP asked for injectable diphenhydramine. HCP continued to monitor pt with RRR and CTA but erythema and angioedema began again along with swollen tongue so EpiPen dose 2 was injected into right vastus lateralis. 50mg IM diphenhydramine was injected into the right deltoid while fire rescue began to arrive on scene. Pt did not report difficulty breathing. Pt did report previous anaphylaxis to fire ant bites/stings and did report being allergic to bee stings. Fire rescue transported patient without difficulty. HCP called pt later that night at 2030 who reported doing better but still having tongue swelling.

Symptoms worsened and broadened to include generalized body aches, headaches, loss of appetite, and overall listlessness which persisted for approximately 30 hours but were ameliorated with Tylenol.  Reddened area appeared on left upper arm, approximately 10cm long by 8cm wide and separate from the site of injection.  The closest point of the reddened area to the site of injection was separated from it by approximately 2cm.  The reddened area was neither painful nor manifested itching.  Gradual reduction in redness and swelling noted as time progressed, but is still visible five days post-injection.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (The patient received monoclonal antibodies.) in January 2021, Myelosuppression (As a result his platelets and white blood cells count were dropped.) in January 2021 and Nose bleed in January 2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Asthenia, Walking difficulty, Pituitary apoplexy (makes him high risk patient) and Panhypopituitarism (makes him high risk patient). Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID), LIOTHYRONINE, CORTISONE, FLUDROCORTISONE, CABERGOLINE, PANTOPRAZOLE, ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN 81), TESTOSTERONE and VITAMIN E NOS for an unknown indication.   On 19-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (Awake hallucination) (seriousness criterion medically significant), TREMOR (Shaking chills), ERYTHEMA (Feet were red), MYALGIA (Myalgia), ARTHRALGIA (Arthralgia), CHILLS (Chills,Teeth were chattering), HEADACHE (Headache), NAUSEA (Nausea) and VOMITING (Violent vomiting, vomit was coming out of his nose). On 20-Mar-2021, the patient experienced EPISTAXIS (Nose bleed again for 1 to 2 days when he sneezed or coughed). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ABDOMINAL PAIN (abdominal pain) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (lymphadenopathy). On 20-Mar-2021, HALLUCINATION (Awake hallucination), TREMOR (Shaking chills), ERYTHEMA (Feet were red), MYALGIA (Myalgia), ARTHRALGIA (Arthralgia), CHILLS (Chills,Teeth were chattering), HEADACHE (Headache), NAUSEA (Nausea) and VOMITING (Violent vomiting, vomit was coming out of his nose) had resolved. At the time of the report, EPISTAXIS (Nose bleed again for 1 to 2 days when he sneezed or coughed), ABDOMINAL PAIN (abdominal pain) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (lymphadenopathy) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to events was not applicable.  Based on current available information and the temporal association between product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                69 YO M CARDIAC ARREST. PT HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS COVID VACCINATION AND WAS PULLING INTO THE OBSERVATION AREA WHEN HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS TRUCK, BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND CRASHED INTO A LIGHT POLE. THIS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE STANDBY MEDIC UNIT AND OTHER FIRE DEPT STAFF. PT WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN CARDIAC ARREST. CPR WAS INITIATED WITHIN SECONDS OF BEING REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE. EMS WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DEFIBRILLATED FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINE WAVE VT/COURSE VF WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF HIS ARREST. PT WAS PLACED ONTO A BACK BOARD AND MOVED TO AMBULANCE IN A PULSED VT AND WAS AWAKE AND RESPONSIVE. ONCE IN THE BACK THE PT WAS WIRED INTO THE FOUR LEAD AND WAS SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERTED AT 100 J WITH A CONVERSION TO A PULSED JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM WITH A RATE OF ABOUT 58. THIS RHYTHM CHANGED INTO A SINUS TACH AT ABOUT 100 BPM. IV ACCESS WAS OBTAINED AND 100 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS ADMINISTERED WITH A 2:1 LIDO DRIP HUNG. AMBULANCE BEGAN TRANSPORT TO ER. OVER NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES PT BEGAN HAVING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY IN THE FORM OF PVCs COUPLETS AND EVENTUALLY 4-5 BEAT RUNS OF VTACH WHILE ON PHONE WITH ER MD. DISCUSSED GIVING ANOTHER BOLUS OF LIDO AND INCREASING DRIP TO 3:1 DUE TO INCREASING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY. THE ER PHYSICIAN CONCURRED AND ANOTHER 75 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS GIVEN FOLLOWED BY INCREASING THE DRIP RATE TO 3MG/MINUTE FOLLOWING THE SECOND LIDO DOSE AND DRIP ADJUSTMENT THE PATIENT&#39;S VENTRICULAR ECTOPY RESOLVED AND THE PATIENT REMAINED IN A SINUS RHYTHM / SLOW SINUS TACH THROUGHOUT TRANSPORT AND TRANSFER OF CARE TO THE ER. A 12 LEAD WAS OBTAINED JUST PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN ED THAT SHOWED SINUS TACH WITHOUT VENTRICULAR ECTOPY BUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE PACs, FLIPPED T WAVES IN a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

Severe rash up neck, over the right ear, across right cheek, around right eye and across right side of nose. Our family doctor examined patient on Thursday, 2/25 and said it would get better on it&#39;s own. It continued to worsen and he was very ill with vomiting, low grade fever and chills. On Monday 3/1 he went to the ER was put on Kefflex antibiotics. The diagnosis was cellulitis.  After 7 days of treatment he is much better, the rash has dried up and only red scabs are left to heal.

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

On the afternoon at an unknown time, his leg had gotten worse.  He had severe pain on his left leg; it was painful to the touch; it was swollen and was hard as a rock.  He called 911.  He was taken to  Hospital.  Pt wanted me to report that he did not receive any treatment for his blood clot.  He received a Lidocaine patch on his knee and was given a prescription for Voltaren Gel.  (he was expecting to receive TPA to dissolve the clot like a few times before when he had blood clots but this particular time he did not)

The  vaccination site is about 1 cm down from the top of the swelling, so the swelling, redness and itching mostly extend down my arm from the injection site

Approximately 10 to 15 minutes later, his care provider brought him to me and stated that his face was &#34; red and splotchy&#34;.  It was noted that Patient had red, raised areas on his face. Patient is non verbal and developmentally disabled, so I was unable to assess if these were itchy. I assessed his neck, chest and arms, no red raised areas noted. I placed a pulse oximeter onto the patients finger, oxygen saturation 95% or greater, heart rate 90-100&#39;s no visual signs of distress.

At on or around 8:45 PM my dad called my sister that he was having trouble breathing and felt very short of breath. My sister was there in about 7min by the time she got to him my dad was gasping for air he would lift his head up trying to breath. They got him to the hospital shorty after about a 7 min drive. My dad was taken into hospital we were not able to go in due to restrictions.

                                                About a week after getting my second dose I developed a severe, very itchy, swelling and raised bumps on my front and back torso, my face and my arms. My doctor put me on hydroxyzine and Pep-Cid because they felt Prednisone would suppress my immune system. Two weeks later he has put me on Prednisone because the first course of action did not work. I&#39;ve gotten through two days worth of Prednisone.

                                                I spoke on 03/09/2021 with a question from him. He received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine as Moderna on 02/16/2021. He reports he did well with his shot initially and didn&#39;t really even have a sore arm. About 6-7 days after his vaccine, however, he started getting some significant redness, warmth, tenderness and then swelling in his arm that continued to worsen. became concerned that his reaction was more than would be normally expected so he was seen by a doctor who diagnosed him with cellulitis and started him on antibiotics and steroids. He had completed his antibiotics at the time of our conversation and said his arm felt better but was still slightly red. His doctor recommended that he not get a second dose of Moderna, but suggested that he might get a Pfizer or a Janssen vaccine instead, and was wondering about our recommendation for this? I let patient know that there are no specific studies for the interchangability  of these vaccines but there is a statement from CDC that says if an individual is unable to get a 2nd dose of an mRNA vaccine due to a contraindication, they could consider getting one dose of Janssen vaccine at least 28 days after the first dose to have a complete valid J&amp;J dose. I encouraged to speak with his provider about this possibility and any further action. I did some education on potential causes of cellulitis and let him know that per immunization guidance, cellulitis isn&#39;t necessarily a contraindication to a second dose of vaccine but more of a precaution as it can be difficult to know the exact cause and a second dose may not result in the same side effect. Several times reported no respiratory symptoms or other symptoms than the cellulitis. I again recommended him to speak with his provider for the best plan of action and he agreed to this.

                                                Patient went to bed totally fine and woke up saying he could not see in one eye. I rushed him to the emergency hospital they ran cat scans, MRI, heart tests etc. He stayed overnight while they checked. The next day we went to eye doctor who told him he had a eye stroke. He would regain some of his site not all of it. Something to do with blood clot or loss of blood to the eye. I was not satisfied with that so made another drs appointment for the next day with a different eye doctor. The first eye doctor gave us some blood test to do so we did it then. Later that evening we got an emergency call form the first eye doctor to get back to the hospital right away he could lose sight in the other eye.. They found some high c-reactive protein. Normal is 8 his was over 40. They put him on heavy steroids and did biopsy on both temples of his eyes. This started last Wednesday morning. He was released from the hospital Monday Morning to see his regular doctor that afternoon. Test results for the eye would be Tuesday and all other vital tests came back fine thank goodness. On Tuesday the biopsy tests also came back negative so they are stopping steroids. I think they were looking for auto immune issues. Today we are going to Rheumatologist

The rash on my leg became extremely red and caused pain and swelling. None of these symptoms have abated.

It came up the day after receiving the vaccine and has lasted 5 weeks and the Valicyclovere isn&#39;t working. it went away by 03/10/2021. I also experienced fever and weakness 03/06/21 and then when it resolved the herpes came up. Went to the doctor at a walk in clinic on 02/24/21 because I had high fever and nausea and weakness for about 10 hours. I got an infected tooth(root canal and crown on this tooth) and an infected jaw. Dentist put me on antibiotics and I have to have the tooth pulled. I went to the dentist on 02/11/2021.

                                                Besides expected head ache and slight fatigue, I woke up on the night of 3/17 (day 2 following 2nd vaccine dose) with extreme pain in my right big toe and foot, with some cramping in the right calf.  It was difficult to walk.  I stayed in bed most of the next day with right leg elevated, and using ice to help pain and swelling. My wife and I suspected Gout, however it would have been a first for me to have it.  By 3/19 it felt a little better, but right foot still swollen, and my wife and I noticed a pronounced vein from the right knee down. She got scared that it could be a blood clot, so we called Dr and he ordered ultra sound, which was done on 3/19 in afternoon, but technician said that saw &#34;nothing&#34;.  Today (3/20) foot still sore and it&#39;s hard to put wight on it still.

                                                PLEASE HELP.  I have had moderate to severe pain at upper left arm injection site starting approximately 1/15/2021, a day after the injection, until the present.  It manifests itself mostly during sleep and awakes me with significant constant pain while in a reclining position.  When I sit up, it is somewhat alleviated and I have to take extended release tylenol (650mg) to get back to sleep.  I wake up most mornings with the same left arm pain at the injections site.  On March 16, 2021, my internist examined it and found the same bump in my upper left arm and said it is definitely from the 1st vaccination.  He suggested heat on and off for 20 minutes.  I tried it two evenings in a row and the pain got worse in bed.  Since I cannot take any NSAIDs due to my aspirin regimen for Coronary Artery Disease, there seems nothing else to do, but I am worried that some long lasting detriment is happening to my body.  PLEASE HELP.  I did not have any such symptoms from the second Moderna vaccine received 2/11/2021.

                                                Lymphadenopathy; A Literature Non-Study report,  was received from a physician concerning a 72 year old male patient who developed Lymphadenopathy/Lymphadenopathy.  The patient&#39;s medical history included Mantel cell lymphoma, completion of chemotherapy with complete metabolic response to the therapy 10 months prior to immunization with mRNA-1273. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  Prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.  After receiving a dose of  mRNA-1273, (onset date and time not provided), the patient developed Lymphadenopathy.  Treatment information was not provided.   According to the literature abstract, two days following the patient&#39;s immunization, he underwent a FDG PET/CT examination.   Per report abstract,  &#34;Series follow up FDG PET/CT scans have been negative for lymphoma&#34;.  &#34;Current FDG PET/CT scan showed a new cluster of subcentimeter left axillary lymphadenopathy with avid FDG uptake.  There was also focal FDG uptake in the left upper arm deltoid muscle and adjacent subcutaneous soft tissue, with no other abnormal FDG avid lesion or suspicious CT image findings&#34;.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.  The event, Lymphadenopathy, outcome was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 72-year-old male with PMH of Mantel cell lymphoma S/P chemotherapy with complete metabolic response, who had a serious unexpected event of lymphadenopathy, with FDG PET/CT 2 days after first dose mRNA-1273 showing new cluster left axillary and upper arm deltoid muscle nodes. Event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

At this time my flu like symptoms remain at gradually reducing levels - mostly resolved.  My gingivitis symptoms also re reducing but it is still very painful to attempt brushing my teeth.

At about 6:15 PM contacted a relative who is an active nurse at a local hospital.  She said problem was a swollen lymph node and to ice it and take Tylenol if desired.  I iced it for 15 minutes and took two high strength Tylenol at about 6:30 PM.  Pain stopped at 7:00 PM.  Pain returned at 10:00 PM and I reapplied ice for 25 minutes (did not take any more Tylenol).  When ice was removed, pain had stopped.  Went to bed and awoke at about 12:30 AM and 3:00 AM with no pain.  No more pain throughout today.

                                                On January 19, 2021 (4 days after the vaccine injection) I developed severe itching in the palms of my hands.  By the next day, January 20, 2021, I had developed severe hives bilaterally from my groin areas down to almost my knees, as well as on my buttox.  I also had severe hives in both armpits.   Both hands (palms) and wrists had become swollen and fire-engine red and the itching was maddening.  I saw a Physician who gave me an injection of Depo Medrol and a 7 day prescription of Dexamethasone, 4mg ,  take twice a day and a prescription of  Hydroxyzine HCL 25 mg, 4 times a day as needed.      The hives began to fade after 18 hours of medication and got fainter and fainter each day, along with relief from itching.   Hives were completely gone by the time I completed the 7 day cycle of Dexamethasone.   I have not had a recurrence.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine. First vaccination - 1/4/21. Second - 2/1/21. No significant reactions to either: no fever, chills, myalgias, fatigue, etc. However, about 1-2 weeks post the first vaccine, I developed mild distal finger joint stiffness and slight pain and swelling. Both hands. R&gt;L. Involving 3rd - 5th fingers. Not symetrical. No other joint pains or spine pain.  There has been slight reddish soft tissue swelling  of distal phalanges  of involved fingers. Nails look normal.  Also, few punctate red spots - sl painful; they look like punctate hemorrhages. No systemic symptoms. Not requiring medication. Findings persistant till now. No involvement of toes. No generalized body rashes. I do not have psoriasis, but these findings are reminiscent of findings one would see with Psoriatic Arthritis. I am an MD (Internist). I thought this may be interesting since it looks to me like a possible immune-mediated reaction. I do have photographs available.

This time around on Tuesday pt got a COVID vaccine and 6 hours after pt started feeling nauseous and 3 days after the vaccine had numbness in his feet b/l at first. Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there. Pt woke up this morning and went from his bed to his chair and since then pt was not able to get up from the chair.

                                                I am writing this to let you know that two weeks after receiving my first COVID 19 vaccination I developed a   severe blood clot from my right ankle to my right groin.   I am Factor 5 deficient, and believe that the vaccine caused the clot.  I had no symptoms at all until I noticed my right calf was swollen (no pain).  My wife insisted I go to emergency because I am Factor 5 deficient and inclined to thickening of the blood.  I  have not been on a plane or taken a long trip by car.  I walk 3 miles a day, play golf and am very active.  I strongly believe the vaccine caused the clot.  I will be on blood thinners the rest of my life..

                                                Second day (Tuesday 1/5/21) swelling and some soreness on inside of throat right side. Wednesday 1/6/21 swelling had spread significantly to inside the right side of mouth and tongue also affecting right jaw. By 3 Pm that day my tongue was numb and swollen on the right side as well as the right side of my mouth and jaw. I could only chew, eat, and swallow effectively on the left side of my mouth using the left side of my tongue to negotiate eating.  I could only this with small amounts of food. By that evening about 4 hours later I could eat , chew etc. pretty good but the swelling &amp; discomfort remained but reduced to a functional level.  Today, Thursday 1/7/21, the soreness and discomfort remains inside throat, mouth, tongue and jaw all on the right side.

Next morning, it was elevated, hot, with peeling eczema flaking skin.  It was still itchy. Now, 24 hours later, it is still red, itchy, elevated, hot to the touch, with peeling eczema flaking skin.   It is not clear if Benadryl would be helpful and/or safe to take for this so no medication is being used at the present time. More information about this would be helpful.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care.

After starting the infusion he developed sudden onset shortness of breath.  He is noted to be wheezing.  He was given Solu-Medrol and benadryl prior to transfer to ED.   Acute hypoxic respiratory failure in patient with recent Covid diagnosis with sudden worsening during monoclonal antibody infusion.  Differential includes allergic reaction/anaphylaxis, flash pulmonary edema, worsening Covid. Given the wheezing he was given a DuoNeb with no significant improvement but may be slightly decreased wheezing.  Patient was placed on BiPAP given concern for pulmonary edema and increased work of breathing.  We were able to titrate down the FiO2 to 40%.  He was transitioned to high flow nasal cannula.  Will admit to the hospital for further supportive cares given Covid and hypoxic respiratory failure.

He is still hospitalized but improving as of the date of this report. His COVID-19 test was negative on the day of admission. He had no symptoms out of the ordinary on the day of his vaccination. I am reporting this as it occurred in the week after his first dose of vaccine though would suspect the timing is likely coincidental rather than directly related to the vaccine.

                                                Pt had onset of swelling  and tenderness to underarms bilaterally. I examined him in my clinic, determined to moderate bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. Lymph nodes were soft and tender.   Pt had no fever or other symptoms. Treated with Tylenol as needed and supportive care. Symptoms improving, I believe prognosis to be good.  Likely immune reaction, no allergic reaction in my professional opinion. Vaccine given at  vaccine clinic, not at our facility.

On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker. On March 12 he received a cortisone shot and required emergency medical assistance to get into a personal vehicle with a family member who drove to the appointment. The next few days, the pain persisted, became worse, and spread throughout his body. On March 16 he was transported by emergency medical services to the local emergency room for treatment and was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia. On March 18 he was still being treated when he experienced cardiac arrest while being intubated. He was resuscitated and was on a ventilator being treated for a few more days but ultimately succumbed to sepsis on March 30.
