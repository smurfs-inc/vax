He later developed arm swelling from elbow down to fingertips. That swelling resolved in about 1 month.  The stiffness and dexterity  of hand has improved but not back to normal  4 months later. Interestingly, patient developed same symptoms on his left arm after he had his second Moderna Covid vaccine on 3/4/21 in the left arm.  That swelling is just now resolving.

                                                My birthfather had an adverse reaction after he got his 1st Moderna COVID vaccine.  He lives alone and was doing well with some underlying conditions. The day of the shot was fine.  The next AM, he had vision changes and sudden numbness in his R arm/leg and fell after getting up.  ?The numbness went away pretty quickly, but the visual changes remained.  He refused to go to the ER/Dr.  The next week and a half, he was weak, tired, and couldn?t think as clearly.  ?He was brought to the ER? on Wed, 3/3/21 at Hospital.  He was found to have a low oxygen level, possible a-fib, fluid retention, emphysema, and aortic stenosis, in addition to his other health issues.  ?The Dr said his symptoms the day after the vaccine were a mini-stroke..  He was released from the hospital on Friday, 3/5/21.  On Saturday, Hospice came to see him, since nothing can be done for his medical conditions; however, they decided not to sign him up yet, since he I was told they didn&#39;t feel he needed to, at this time.  One of my sisters is staying with him during the day until he builds his strength back up.  Do you think his Mini stroke and health changes had anything to do with the vaccine? He will not be getting the second COVID shot.   ?We?re all caught between a rock and a hard place as far as what to do, esp for older folks.

It was very itchy, red and very painful. I went to the dermatologist right away and was diagnosed with Shingles infection. The doctor gave me an injection (don&#39;t remember name) and prescribed Valtrex and Pepcid. The medication did not help resolve the shingles and it got worse. I went to the hospital 4/6/2021 and I was admitted to the hospital for 7 days.  I was admitted because I was dehydrated and had an allergic reaction to the shot the dermatologist gave me. I also pneumonia and septic.  They ran every test they could run and gave me antibiotics for the pneumonia and infection. I was discharged to follow up PCP.

                                                In the early morning hours of Saturday 2/27, Dad woke with severe pain in his right arm, shoulder and shoulder blade.  He realized the right side of his neck was swollen and his throat was swollen as well. He was having trouble swallowing, talking and his breathing felt obstructed. He tried to awaken my Mother but she couldn&#39;t understand what he was saying. He finally managed to get up with on walker and make his way to get a drink of water. After that his throat seemed to loosen up some and by later in the morning  the swelling had subsided. He did not inform me until I called later in that morning to check on them and he did not feel he needed to see a doctor.
