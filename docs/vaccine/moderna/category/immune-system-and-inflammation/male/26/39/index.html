                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection at 6 pm I began to experience right sided ankle pain and swelling and mild chills. The pain peaked about 2 hours later about a 5/10 and was constant. I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen and elevated my foot. The right ankle was visibly swollen and red compared to the left.  Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

Pt was grabbing his legs and rubbing them, and initially staff thought it was pain that would resolve.  However, on 2/22, lower extremity edema was noted, and pt without improving symptoms, so he was brought to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. GBS suspected, IVIG initiated.

Patient underwent COVID vaccination 04Feb. Noted approx 16Feb to have increasing swelling in axillary region. Pt underwent breast ultrasound on 23Feb found to have breast mass and atypical appearing axillary lymph nodes, recommended for biopsy. Followed up with provider 25Feb and was referred to General Surgery. 08Mar had initial surgery consult, symptoms had modest improvement, recommended by surgery to monitor symptoms and defer 2nd COVID vaccination. 13MAR - axillary lymph node swelling returned 15Mar - patient was recommended by immunizations provider and nurse to defer 2nd vaccination and return to surgery for likely excisional biopsy of axillary lymph node and breast mass. Awaiting final surgery input on treatment plan.

Soreness was remarkable until four days after the injection. Night of 3/30/2021 at approximately around 9:30 pm I felt soreness in the left axillary region (in my left armpit). This at first was thought to be unremarkable as I was wearing a tight shirt at the time. However, after switching to looser clothing the soreness and pain continued and now considered remarkable. The day after (3/31/21 Today of this report), I still have pain and what feels to be a swollen lymph node in the left axillary region (in my left armpit). This is sore and painful and feels palpable.

                                                On 2/21/2021 approx. 5PM patient noticed some pain and swelling of right axilla. Described as if &#34;someone punched me in the armpit.&#34; Symptoms worsened by the next morning, so on 2/22/2021 patient sought care at a local Urgent Care facility. Treating provider felt symptoms were most consistent with cellulitis of the right axilla. One week course of antibiotics (Bactrim 1 tab twice daily) was prescribed. Follow up with PCP was recommended for 2-3 days or sooner if symptoms worsened or additional symptoms presented. No laboratory testing or radiology procedures were performed. Patient filled prescription for antibiotics and started taking same day. On 2/25/2021 patient reported that symptoms were improving but not completely resolved.

Red swelling that is warm to the touch and slight itchiness.  Extends around from the tricep to bicep and mostly below the injection site, down to near the elbow. No pain besides that of a normal IM vaccination.  Currently still experiencing the symptoms, but not taking any treatment as none are necessary.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

Patient came in today around 1 pm stating he was sore and couldn&#39;t sleep last night and today he has limited movement in left arm. He can lift it up to almost horizontal position forward but difficulty moving it backwards. He took 2 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen as directed and still sore. Advised he can take 4 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen (800 mg) every 8 hours for a day and see if that relieves pain and motion. He can also put a cold compress to affected area for slight swelling.

                                                30 yo man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED for chest pressure and SOB that started this morning when he woke up. It was a constant 8/10 pressure squeezing at the sides of his sternum with the sensation of a plate pushing down on his sternum, that worsened by taking deep breaths. He had never experienced anything like it before. The pain was neither worsened with exertion nor relieved by rest. It did not change with position, and it did not radiate to his arm/neck. He denies any tenderness to palpation of his chest. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not provide any relief. At time of interview denies SOB and reports decrease in chest tightness to 2/10. CP was significantly relieved with a bolus of normal saline in the ED. Tylenol also effectively reduced his pain. Of note, the patient received the second Moderna COVID vaccine shot 3 days ago. For 2 days after receiving the second shot he experienced fevers, chills, nausea, and intermittent vomiting (10 bouts of non-bloody emesis).

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

Benadryl 37.5 mg oral was administered, and symptoms gradually improved and resolved over the next 10-15 minutes.  Patient did not meet the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis, and epinephrine was not administered while patient was in the office.  Patient never developed respiratory compromise, GI symptoms, or reduced BP/end-organ dysfunction.  Vital signs remained normal and stable following reaction and at the time of resolution of symptoms.  It was recommended that patient go to the ED (by EMS) for monitoring purposes/delayed reaction.  EMS transport was declined by patient.

He reports he has not had any symptoms to the right eye, itself. He states he has some mild facial drooping involving his right upper eyelid and his right cheek. He reports mild swelling under his right eye, as well as to his right cheek area. He also reports that he can?t fully open his right eye, which impairs his field of vision; otherwise, denies any vision changes. Instructed that the symptoms were suggestive of Bell?s Palsy, but to go straight to ER for further evaluation.

Then I had severe migraines and throwing up even though I?ve never had migraines before. This lasted about a week. Then I began to develop painful lymph nodes and got shingles, also something that has never happened before. Shingles healing right as I got second shot on March 5th and had same high fever sick reaction as first week of second shot but with diarrhea this time which I did not have the first time.

                                                A few days after the vaccine my lymph nodes in my upper cervical area high in my neck area swollen which caused me to have a sore throat. A single small ulcerative lesion appeared in the upper soft palate of my mouth so I went to a walk in clinic and had a strep done which was negative. D/t the ulcers appearing in my mouth I had and HIV test done which also came back negative. I had a small low grade fever and muscle aches also associated but the lesion in my mouth is what caused the major concern which slowly resolved over the next few weeks.

                                                A few hours after the injection, my left arm started to hurt more than expected and decreased my arm mobility for the day. When I try to use it, it caused mild pain. After waking up, my left arm deltoid muscle was visibly swollen and has a medium amount of pain and significantly decreased range of motion. Because this event has not yet resolved, I may seek advice from my primary care doctor later today

About three hours later I began to feel light headed and fatigued. Over night between the 27th and 28th I became feverish, with chills, shaking, and sweating. On the 28th I experienced fatigue, lymph node swelling in my neck and left armpit, and all over body aches. On the 29th I continued to experience fatigue and pain in my lymph nodes. In addition, I began to experience a migraine headache which  persisted for about 30 hours. My symptoms generally abated  by the morning of the 31st .

Blood test showed that I am suddenly highly allergic to 19 different food groups. I have no known food allergies prior to C19 Moderna Vaccine. I have had hives every single day since they 1st appeared (3.5 days after vaccine). I have had multiple days of facial swelling as well and have been to the hospital multiple times. To this date (date of this report) I still have hives and facial swelling. Facial swelling is intermittent. I have stayed away from the list of foods that I am apparently suddenly allergic to and I still have hives and swelling. I occasionally have a irritated throat which makes it difficult to breathe in. I have a specialist appointment with an allergy/immunology doctor this coming Thursday to see what thier diagnosis is. My family doctor believes my potential angioedema diagnosis is directly related to my 1st dose of C19 Moderna Vaccine.

The symptoms felt just like past instances of the flu I&#39;ve had.  Given this, I didn&#39;t go to work on 3/29, and instead went to get a covid test.  On 3/29, I also started to get consistent pain in emanating from the lymph node in my right arm, the same arm I received the vaccine in on 3/22.  The actual vaccine site no longer has any tenderness, and it was never painful after the shot.  I had no symptoms at all between 3/22 and 3/28.  The lymph node under my right arm is visibly swollen as well.  On 3/30, I was given the results of my covid test from 3/29, which was &#34;covid-19 not present.&#34;

The pain then progressed to the right neck and supraclavicular area. He felt throbbing , sore, numbness as well and &#34;shocks&#34;. Over the next view days the pain was shooting down his triceps and numbness and tingling and then numbness in the fourth and fifth fingers. No muscle weakness and no fever or chills. No systemic symptoms. He complained of the tingling numbness and a sense of swelling--all down the right arm in the c6-7 distribution. On April first his wife noted a vesicular rash on the right side of his neck with a few lesions on the right upper back. He was not responding to NSAIDs, ice or heat, immobilization, so at this point the clinical diagnosis of shingles/varicella zoster was made and Valtrex 1000 mg tid was started.

                                                Patient symptoms of chills, headache, and body aches began on Sunday 3/28, 6 days after vaccination.   One day later, on 3/29, patient started experiencing pain in the right armpit, the same shoulder where the vaccine was received.  That pain built up until Wednesday 3/31, when the arm was very swollen, purple, and rapidly loosing sensation.  The patient went to the ER.  In the ER, via ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis of the right subclavian and axillary veins.  From 4/1 to 4/2 the patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure, thrombo lysis, using tPA directed by catheter to the site of the 12 cm long clot.  On 4/2, it was determined that the flow was not restored to the vein, and the radiologist informed the patient that right first rib removal would be necessary.  On 4/9, right first rib resection surgery was performed to alleviate pressure on the subclavian vein.  Patient is currently recovering on the blood thinner Eliquis.  Additional procedures for thrombo ectomy and angioplasty will follow in approximately two weeks to clear the subclavian and axillary veins.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

It was more tender and there was moderate to sever pain in the armpit. I took some advil with minimal relief. On the 3rd day (today) the swelling seemed a littlw worse and the pain increased slightly. I contacted my plastic surgeon (since back in October 2019) because i had a procedure called miradry, which elemintes the sweat glands in my bilateral armpits. The doctor advised me to come in immeidately to the office. Upon arrival the doctor examined the area and was able to se immiedalty that is was swollen. I consented to pictures being taken. He is making an entry as well as I am and I was advised to ice the area and to take advil and to remain in contact.

                                                2 days after receiving my first dose my tongue began to feel tingly and swell, I could feel the tightness in the back and in my lymph nodes as well. I began to have sensitivity to spicy foods on Thursday. On Friday I woke up and my words were slurring as my tongue felt more swollen  and I started to notice some slight swelling in my throat, maybe 5%. I started gargling diphenhydramine on Friday night and that helped a lot, I also took loratadine and Fexofenadine. By Sunday my symptoms were masked by the allergy drugs and I stopped taking the diphenhydramine. 1 week later, 12 days post Moderna Vaccinne I stopped taking the fexofenadine and Loratadine. I continued to have tongue irritation and a sore on my tongue for 2.5 weeks. I then had an adverse event after the 2nd shot as well.

However, the site of the injection on my left arm has turned red. I would say it is a red circle with a radius of 1.5-inch around the injection location. It is painful when pressed on. Also my left armpit (lymph nod) is swollen and is painful. Hopefully I won&#39;t die :/

                                                Delayed reaction to the vaccine that began 6 days after first dose and persisted for approximately 3 days. I first became itchy on my abdomen and arms, I then developed flat oval hives and my eyes and upper lip began swelling. My throat did not swell. I took 2 Benadryl that evening that helped the itch and caused the facial swelling to subside somewhat. I slept thru the night and when the Benadryl wore off in the morning, the same symptoms returned. I took 1 Benadryl which again calmed the symptoms. The same symptoms returned in the evening and I went to an Urgent Care. I was prescribed Prednisone and more Benadryl. These medicines helped to calm the symptoms even more, but the itchiness and hives did come and go thru the next day. On day 3 I took Zyrtec in addition to my last dose of Predisone and the itchiness subsided completely. I took one more dose of Zyrtec the next day and the symptoms have not returned. I followed up with my PCM who tested for a Hazelnut allergy as I had eaten them that first night. She also referred me to an Allergist. I saw the Allergist who said in their opinion my immune system was having a reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and classified me as &#34;medium risk&#34; for the second dose. He recommended that I still get the second dose and to premeditate with Zyrtec the night before, day of and for 7 days following.

On Day 8, some pain developed in addition. On Day 9, the rash grew in size and was itchy. On Day 10, it was almost cleared up. On Day 11, it appeared gone, On Day 12, the rash *re-appeared* but had grown in size. On Day 13, the rash was even bigger - had spread further down my arm. By Day 14, it had almost disppeared.  On Day 5, I noticed a swollen lymph node near my left clavicle. On Day 6, this lymph node had swelled and now there was pain. I also experienced slight discomfort under my left armpit. The pain associated with the clavicle lymph node lasted until Day 8. As of Day 14, the lymph node is still swollen.

The pain then moved to the middle of my back at the spine and blades of my lower back shoulders. The pain has lasted for a little over a week now and has lessened over time but is still noticeable. If I tried to sneeze or inhale deeply, this was difficult due to the discomfort I felt in my back and the sides of my neck.

Second, 7 days after vaccination, itchy and hot area of hives developed around the injection spot and slowly grew  into a 6 inch circle. Third, at the same time with the second symptom, I am having a mild sciatic pain in my right leg.  Symptom 1 has subsided, and symptoms 2 and 3 are still present, but seem to have slowed down.

Pain radiating to testicles.  Entire body aching.  Couldn&#39;t find comfortable position to sit/stand/walk.   Worse than any illness I&#39;ve had, but without the brain fog Within next 48 hours: Armpit swollen on right arm (same as vaccine arm).  Pain in head persisting.  Pain behind ears.  Dizzy/lightheaded feeling. Third Day after vaccine: Armpit is still swollen.  Headache persists.  Ache in muscles and joints seem to be re-emerging.  But, overall, I&#39;m fine and can work today. Note: Pollen count high - and I typically do get headaches from pollen - so, headaches could be attributable to pollen, but timing is suspicious.

But the welt is still there, and I feel the swelling more so now than I did last night. It&#39;s now been about 38 hours since receiving vaccine. It doesn&#39;t seem to be getting worse, aside from now being able to feel the swelling. Also, like I said, the blister-like bumps, on the welt/swelled area, have dissipated, so that got better. My face is also breaking out with acne since the shot. I do occasionally get acne break outs tho.

                                                The patient received his 2nd dose of Moderna (LOT#, site, time unavailable) at an outside clinic the morning of 2/10/21 and presented to the ED with coughing and hypoxia (sp02 occasionally dropping into 70&#39;s) at 8 PM that day.  He had quadriplegic spinal paralysis as a result of a remote MVA and has been hospitalized and critically ill in the past due to recurrent UTI&#39;s and pneumonia with associated sepsis.   CT negative for pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral infiltrates.  Clinical presentation consistent with bilateral pneumonia and started on Rocephin/azithromycin.  He was initially stable in the hospital on 1-2 LPM 02.  The following evening he became febrile and acutely developed asystole without any pre-existing arrhythmia.  Resuscitation was attempted for 45 minutes but unsuccessful.  Overall, I suspect his death was related to bacterial pneumonia and resulting acute respiratory failure, complicated by his quadriplegia and autonomic dysreflexia but reported this event as it did occur within 2 days of receiving his 2nd Moderna vaccination.

In addition, I developed a rash on my arm and was bedridden. I took a small walk that day and proceeded to swell up on the left side of my body but it subsided within a few hours. The next day, I suffered a stroke due to blot clotting and the clot flowing to my brain. I had to go to the hospital and was there for a few days.

It felt like indigestion. Pain stayed mild until Saturday evening when I started vomiting and had diarrhea and by 11:00 pm I went to the ER where they did bloodwork and a ct scan. Bloodwork showed high white blood cell count, scan showed appendicitis. After 4.5 hours there, I had to leave to go to another hospital and wait for a bed. After being in intense pain for a few more hours, I finally had the emergency surgery at 11:00 am Sunday the 9th.

Paresthesia and nerve pain developed in bilateral legs 4 hours after shot and progressed slowly for 4 days in intensity and area involved. Symptoms progressed distally to superior. On the 5th day symptoms progressed rapidly and involved bilateral legs up to the groin, left arm up to lateral shoulder, and right hand. I went to the hospital and was admitted to start IVIG treatment for Guillain Barre Syndrome/AIDP.

                                                Then this past Tuesday (03-23-2021) I went to receive the 2nd Covid-19 Moderna Vaccine at 1:00pm. I felt fine and had no adverse after this vaccination until 8:30pm the same day. At this time I started to have sever  itching and within an hour the itching was over my entire body. It was a mixture of hives and regular pruritus/itching and areas of swelling throughout my body. This lasted all through the night into Wednesday, 03-24-21. Around the same time as the itching started Tuesday night, my Spinal joints, Hip joints, shoulder joints, knee joints, wrist and ankles became severely inflamed and very painful. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst pain, at the highest I was at a 9.    On Wednesday, I went in to my Primary Care for the itching and the pain. My PCP is on vacation this week, so I saw his Colleague. Dr. visibly recognized the redness from the itching all over my body, along with the extreme pain to my joints and gave me a thorough examination. After his examination  he spoke to another physician who stepped in and also gave me an exam. Dr. advised the other Dr. and me of  his initial hesitancy  sending me home, wanting me to be observed overnight at the Hospital. After going to their Emergency Room. They gave me the choice but I truly thought it would go away over the course of the usual 24 hours post Vaccination; I also did not want to be exposed to any virus/sickness I might encounter/pick up in the Hospital due to my lowered immune system because of the rheumatoid arthritis injection Humira I take bi-monthly.. I explained that I was living with my mom, and our residence is 7 minutes from the Hospital, Emergency Room.) I assured both Physicians if it got worse, my mother would take me to the ER. So instead of going to Hospital, they prescribed a Hydrocortisone Cream of  2.5% for the itching, kept me on oral Benadryl and told me to stay hydrated. Also, Dr. said if it wasn?t better and/or worse Thursday(03/25/21)to come back in for re-evaluation. Along with the medications for itching, they prescribed a dose of pain medicine: Tylenol(APAP) #4 - or Acetaminophen with 60mg of Codeine.    Yesterday - Thursday(03-25-2021) I was no better, and had to go back in to the Clinic.  I was seen by Dr., who also believed this reaction to be based on the Humira along with my immune system naturally being lowered due to the AS and RA medication. Dr. examined me, as by yesterday my hands/fingers were hurting as well and itching was not any better. He prescribed Atarax (Hydroxyzine) 50mg Cap to be taken 3 times per day for the awful Pruritis, which has caused me to scratch so badly that I?ve had some bleeding from areas on my body, near the larger joints and spine. And also changed the Tylenol #4 to every 4 hours, basically more often for the pain associated.    Adding the Hydroxyzine for the itch along with the Hydrocortisone, pain medication and time since Tuesday?s final vaccine, has helped a bit. Today, Friday, I am feeling less itchy but still having quite a bit of joint pain, but less than Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  Because of the itching and joint/spine pain I received very little sleep until last evening when I was able to rest and not itch or toss and turn from pain. Hopefully on the mend.

                                                A 36-year-old gentleman seen today in consultation for further evaluation of unusual reaction following 1st coronavirus vaccine.  He received Moderna recombinant MRNA vaccine on 12/24.  On about 01/02, he developed a maculopapular pruritic rash that he refers to as hives present over the dorsum of both hands and predominantly right side of the face.  He had some facial swelling.  No breathing difficulties or other symptoms.  He does not recall any rash, aches, fever.  A few days later, he went in to the Community Health Clinic and received some prednisone for this, a 5-day course, and apparently, symptoms resolved by about day 4.  No further problems, but he is wondering if he should receive 2nd vaccine.  Again, no immediate symptoms of any importance following 1st Moderna dose on 12/24.   No clear history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, eczema, bee sting allergy or food hypersensitivity.  No problems with previous vaccines.  He is even wondering if the vaccine and rash reaction are related and this is difficult to prove with any certainty.

On day 8 the site began getting extremely itching and has swollen for three days and now has redness and rash on site of injection and is extremely warm to touch and itchy. Patient hasn?t reported to doctor yet as unknown whether this side effect is expected or whether it warrants doctor visit but patient wants adverse event to be known.  Patient doesn?t consider this adverse to be severe yet but somewhere between minor and moderate adverse reaction.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

After 3 days I observed both my lymph nodes in my armpits were swollen and I felt very fatigued.  No real pain on lymph nodes just swollen.   Lasted for approximately 5 days and returned to normal around January 20th.  I am an athletic 37 year old male.  Had no illness prior.  Had telemedicine appointment with my doctor and he said to report the possible side effects.  Also had blood work up done at his requests to confirm everything was ?normal? with me.

                                                Approximately 9 days after initial shot, I developed  swelling (about 1 cm thick) between my elbow and shoulder near the injection site.  The site itself was extremely red/rashy. The area was around 5-6 inches by 4-5 inches.  It was itchy and hot to the touch compared to surrounding tissue. It was accompanied by slight pain in the arm. Symptoms receded by the 11th day.

Tuesday my primary care physician examined me and said it was likely a swollen lymph node, a possible reaction for the shot. It is tender to the touch but does not affect my day to day activity.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

The next day Thursday 1/7/21, I noticed intermittent heart flutter/palpitations. I had my routine morning coffee and I thought the combination of the vaccine and the coffee might be the caused.  The flutter/palpitations continue to the present. I don&#39;t have shortness of breath. The left deltoid pain and swelling subsided. The flutter is intermittent and last 10 to 15 seconds.

The lymph nodes swelled to roughly marble to golf ball sized protrusions in the occipital region of my head. This swelling as also accompanied by more swelling on the top right side of my head and also my skin began to break due to the swelling. Extreme headaches and swelling only started to subside on the right side of the back of my head after I received a steroid shot at an urgent care clinic. The steroid did not diminish the swelling and extreme pain on the right side of my head. A few days after this, I went to another urgent care clinic which diagnosed me some kind of infection due to the swelling and then prescribed me topical and oral antibiotics. As I right this, over three weeks from my first dose, I have scabbing and still some pain in the right side of my head.

                                                Patient developed constellation of fever, chills, profound fatigue, and neck swelling 24 hours after dose 1 which improved with Tylenol and advil but persisted for nearly 4 weeks resulting in 6 day delay in his 2nd vaccination.  During this time, he saw ENT for a chronic cough pre-dating his first shot and underwent CT to rule out sinus disease which revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. He then underwent 2nd dose and had exact same constellation of symptoms along with worsening of cervical lymphadenopathy and has persistent lymphadenopathy on exam at the time of consultation with infectious disease 3/16/2021) albeit symptoms and lymph nodes are improving.

                                                On March 24, 2021, the day of the shot, I only felt soreness in my left arm. The next morning, March 25, 2021, I began to feel body aches, chills, and I was in a cold sweat. I took ibuprofen throughout the day to combat the symptoms. The evening of March 25, 2021, the pain was much more severe (body aches all over my body, including my face, teeth, my hands were sore and stiff, etc.). I did not sleep much of the night because the symptoms were very uncomfortable due to the chills and cold sweats. The morning of March 26, 2021, my left armpit began to swell. By the afternoon, my left armpit (the arm where I received the vaccine) was swollen, tender, and soft. There is some redness and the swelling and tenderness are more pervasive. It is difficult to hang my arm at my side due to the pain and swelling. I understand, after calling the nurse hotline, that this is a common side effect but I also have a skin condition (Hidradenitis Supparativa) and it is difficult to know whether flare-ups are triggered by environmental factors.

                                                In addition to the (common) side effect of chills and body aches, at around 75 hours after getting the shot I developed extreme gas pains and nausea while running, and barely made it home, collapsing on our floor.  I then suffered severe diarrhea (which had not been listed as a possible side-effect).  It is now five days out, and the diarrhea appears to have abated.  But I continue to have lower abdominal bloating and discomfort.  (I also have painful swollen lymph nodes under the armpit of injection, as I did after the first dose, for at least a week.) Note: These gastrointestinal symptoms are NOT like those I suffer from with gastric dysmotility, which affects my upper GI tract.

                                                Moderna Covid - 19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on Wednesday January 6th. EARLY Friday morning around 30 minutes after midnight - I noticed pain on my left shoulder / neck area (tenderness). I began to feel around and found a swollen lymph node at the base of my neck just inside my left collar bone. Seems to be the supraclavical lymphnodes. I also noticed tenderness under my left arm in the arm pit region. I received the injection on the left side.

                                                Besides the usual and expected muscle pain, injection site soreness, and headache, I experienced a mild allergic reaction. Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Lot#, handwritten), I experienced a mild swelling of my face and throat. I noticed the throat swelling when I drank water and also noticed my face tightening up. I have a severe allergic reaction to peaches, so I&#39;m hypersensitive to these types of reactions, and I was a little worried.  My throat and face were swollen for about an hour, but very mild compared to my reaction to peaches,  and it subsided after about 2 hours or so.

Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

I also had a number of large hives acrss my right bicep and elbow, as well as a few smaller hives on my back and underneath my feet.    This reaction was the same reaction I received when I went to the ER on 12/10/2018 for difficulty breathing and an elevated BP.  The ER administered TORODOL and I reacted the same way, ending up in the ER the very next day due to the reaction.    I believe, after much diligent research, the reaction I received to the COVID vaccine was due to the Tromethamine in it, as this ingredient is also in TORODOL.

The patient had a medical history of celiac disease and is a kidney patient (other kidney surgically removed). The reporter states that Patient&#39;s concomitant medications are gabapentin and duloxetine hydrochloride for chronic back pain.  On 11 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (unknown lot number) via intamuscular route on left arm for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On 11 Mar 2021, anaphylaxis 3 minutes post receiving the first dose of vaccine the patient developed numbness and his eyes became swollen, then numbness of the tongue, lips and closing of the throat, which all happened at the vaccination site.The attending EMT provided 3 pills of oral 50mg Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and did not apply an EpiPen. Patient&#39;s blood pressure went extremely high (180/111mmHg) instead of dropping. At that moment, it was decided to contact 911. The paramedics placed the patient on a stretcher and loaded him onto the emergency vehicle to be rushed to the hospital. On the way, the patient was given an EpiPen. While in the hospital, the patient was given more diphenhydramine and injected with methylprednisolone. Patient was in observation for 4 hours and then released with a prescription of an EpiPen. It was reported that the patient was extremely sleepy due to the medications given. When the patient arrived home, he went straight to bed. The patient was hospitalized on 11 Mar 2021 for Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Pruritus and released on same day after 4 hours. The next day, Friday (12 Mar 2021) the patient got up around 10:00am. Then at 10:05am, the symptoms began to reoccur with numbness of the lips, tongue, closing of throat and extreme itchiness. As soon as patient&#39;s husband noticed, he did not apply EpiPen and drove the patient to the emergency room. The emergency room followed the same protocol with methyprednisolone steroid, EpiPen and diphenhydramine. On Saturday (13 Mar 2021) and Sunday (14 Mar 2021), the doctor was seen and the patient was advised to take diphenhydramine every 4 hours. Then this past Monday (15 Mar 2021), patient started developing shortness of breath and a resting heart rate of 135bmp. That day, the patient was taken to urgent care.  There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal. On Monday (22 Mar 2021), patient is scheduled to see a cardiologist who will place the patient on a machine to check his heart rate for 3 days to see what is going on. Follow-up with various health care providers was scheduled for the rest of the week. Nephrologist will be seen on Monday, Neurologist will be seen on Tuesday, and Kaiser will be visited on Wednesday. Reporter stated that even though asked to run bloodwork and images, the emergency room did not do it.  Lab work was performed on Monday (15 Mar 021) which came back normal. A check for blockage of the heart, also had looked fine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Tachycardia, Heart rate increased, and Dyspnoea was unknown.
