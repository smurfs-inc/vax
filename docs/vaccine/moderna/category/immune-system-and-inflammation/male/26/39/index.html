                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection at 6 pm I began to experience right sided ankle pain and swelling and mild chills. The pain peaked about 2 hours later about a 5/10 and was constant. I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen and elevated my foot. The right ankle was visibly swollen and red compared to the left.  Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

However, on 2/22, lower extremity edema was noted, and pt without improving symptoms, so he was brought to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. GBS suspected, IVIG initiated.

Soreness was remarkable until four days after the injection. Night of 3/30/2021 at approximately around 9:30 pm I felt soreness in the left axillary region (in my left armpit). This at first was thought to be unremarkable as I was wearing a tight shirt at the time. However, after switching to looser clothing the soreness and pain continued and now considered remarkable. The day after (3/31/21 Today of this report), I still have pain and what feels to be a swollen lymph node in the left axillary region (in my left armpit). This is sore and painful and feels palpable.

                                                I received my first Moderna shot on March 24th. Just had a sore arm the next day.   April 2nd: Around 1pm at work I was starting to feel a headache coming on. By about 2-3pm it was worse and felt tired/drowsy. I ate supper then went to take a nap at 7:30pm. I woke up at about 10:30pm, checked the time and just felt out of it so I went right back to sleep.  April 3rd: I slept until my dog woke me at about 5:50am and felt pretty good, still minor headache and some chills. During the night I did feel some soreness in my arm that got the covid shot. After I showered I checked my arm and it was swelled up with a rash like redness maybe an inch in diameter. I was fine for most of the day enjoying the nice weather outside. Then about 6pm I started to feel the headache again and some chills. Went to bed at about 10:30pm, headache was bad, had the chills, started coughing some, and just didn?t feel normal, took some Tylenol to help through the night.  April 4th: Slept through the night fine, woke up with a mild headache and a sore throat. Had some dry coughs occasionally throughout the day, but was fine most of the day.  I did check my temperature throughout these past few days and all check were normal.  April 5th: Almost back to normal, still have a sore throat and cough. My arm rash near the shot area has gone away, just a little swollen.  April 6th: Back to normal health.

                                                During my first vaccine I experienced a bruise on my arm that lasted ~3 weeks. My arm swelled (including my fingers which looked like sausages) for a few hours that night.  I also felt like I experienced slight chest congestion for a week or two after. The second vaccine (lot number listed on this form) I have a bruise that in my opinion is worse than the one from the first shot.  The bruise is still present after 1 week. I also feel slight tenderness around the joint area. I have not heard of these symptoms being advertise Will this cause joint damage? Additionally form both vaccines I experienced fever, body aches and obviously a sore arm.

I noticed my feet hurt and that I was showing signs of angioedema beginning on 5/14 and peaking the next day. I also experienced joint/tendon pain in the evening of 5/16 between my legs and feet (upper ankle). I still have hives today. The hives were particularly bad in high-touch areas, near the armpits, lower arms, pelvis areas. I took Benadryl occasionally which helped but at no point did the hives go away.

He said that it wasn&#39;t painful at all, there was no visible redness or swelling upon visual inspection but he claimed that he could feel it.  He was instructed to go get the lump checked at the local hospital on 6/20/21, the day the event was reported to the pharmacy.  The patient has no primary provider that he sees.

                                                Patient is a 27 year old male with history of allergic rhinitis.  He moved to the area in April 2021 and had some initial problems with pollen allergies, but had improved and doing well with Singulair.  He had COVID19 in November 2020, recovered fairly quickly and did not have much in the way of breathing difficulties.  Last month he received both doses of Moderna COVID19 vaccination, second dose administered on 5/25/2021.  After his second dose, he has become progressively more ill.  He did have a fever up to 105F for 24 hours afterwards, but this resolved. He has gone to several urgent cares due to progressively worsening SOB, cough, and malaise.  Coworkers have commented to him that he is just not himself and is slow to get around.  He has gotten to the point he cannot take the trash out without having to stop to catch his breath.  He has been treated with a variety of regimens, including amoxicillin, doxycycline, inhalers, prednisone, and IM steroid shots.  He does get brief mild relief with albuterol inhaler.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

                                                I?ve been experiencing inflammation at areas of direct contact. It started about 20 days after the second dose of moderna vaccine. Symptoms started in my feet.  About one week later it transitioned to my arm. Then to my face. Then to my buttocks. Then to my testicles. These symptoms happen after direct pressure is applied to an area for an extended period of time and last about 1-3 days.  I?m am a resident doctor and needed to go to the ER when my face had angioedema. I?ve gone to my primary care physician as well, who agrees that these symptoms could be vaccine related. I have photos and time stamps of all the above mentioned symptoms and episodes

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    In April 2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced VOMITING (vomiting). On an unknown date, the patient experienced BELL&#39;S PALSY (might have what looked like bells palsy on one side of his face) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (second dose appointment was scheduled for 15May2021 which he missed), NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER (neurologic spasm up and down his spine), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (serious rigid back in the middle of his back) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes along his neck/ has swollen lymph nodes). The patient was treated with CANNABIS at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, BELL&#39;S PALSY (might have what looked like bells palsy on one side of his face), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (second dose appointment was scheduled for 15May2021 which he missed), NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER (neurologic spasm up and down his spine), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (serious rigid back in the middle of his back) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes along his neck/ has swollen lymph nodes) outcome was unknown and VOMITING (vomiting) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 05-May-2021, Olfactory test: negative (normal) negative but it was 24 hour test.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported. Treatment medication not reported.  This case concerns a 28-year-old male patient who received first dose of mRNA-1273 and missed second dose (missed dose.  The patient experienced additional events after first dose for which based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. vomiting is consistent with known safety profile of the vaccine.  However, patient was on multiple concomitant medications which confounds the reported events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28-year-old male patient who received first dose of mRNA-1273 and missed second dose (missed dose.

                                                I went to the doctor for Swollen Lymph nodes under the left armpit and lower abdomen pain. They scheduled an ultrasound of my left breast and a CT of my lower abdomen and pelvis. I have a 3-month follow-up for the lymph nodes and they found minor prostatitis in my abdomen. I was proscribed CIPRO for prostatitis. I then had a rare reaction to the CIPRO which caused my Achilles and patellar tendons to swell and become inflamed. Now I can hardly walk. Prior to all this, I was very active.

Patient came in today around 1 pm stating he was sore and couldn&#39;t sleep last night and today he has limited movement in left arm. He can lift it up to almost horizontal position forward but difficulty moving it backwards. He took 2 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen as directed and still sore. Advised he can take 4 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen (800 mg) every 8 hours for a day and see if that relieves pain and motion. He can also put a cold compress to affected area for slight swelling. If not better in a day or so advised him to contact a doctor, because might need something stronger to treat reaction to vaccine.

                                                About a week (6 days) after I had my first Moderna shot, Inflammation of the hands and fingers started in the forms or red/skin color welts like Hives. Excessive burning and itching sensations, difficult even to wash or rub hands together, scratching was increasing the pain and was resulting in swelling of fingers. Fingertips had pain gotten super sensitive with inflammation.  Couldn&#39;t even form my fist because of swelling and pain. Had a lot of discomfort and difficulty sleeping so took a Tylenol PM one night to reduce the inflammation and to aid the sleep. Only took it once as not much of a fan of medicines. I also soaked my hands in water with baking soda which provided some comfort and reduced the pain and inflammation, applied some coconut oil to soothe the inflammation.  As I thought it was happening because of hives and/or excessive heat increase in the body, I changed my diets, started with foods and ingredients that cools down the body which felt like working and the swelling, pain, burning/itching sensations were slowly pacifying in 3-4 days. I also got acupuncture treatment after 5 days which has helped a lot now. Now after a week and all that I did, I don&#39;t feel the pain and burning sensations anymore, no swelling and the skin is getting clear, red spots/welts are disappearing and I am able to sleep better.

                                                Noticed hives about an hour after getting the shot forming all around my body.  Thought it was normal as the covid rash.  Quickly started feeling ill. Had a small amount of trouble breathing and a fever with swelling  and the hives became larger as my skin was flushed. Googled it and it said that this was a normal reaction and common side effects.  So I did not do anything and fell asleep because I felt badly. The next day I woke up to see the bumps all over my body including my digits and pelvic region. Called and talked to my wife she told me to go to the hospital. I started feeling a bit better though and decided against it and took rest that day. The following day the rash had become raised and tender across my body.

                                                PT was given the Moderna vaccine around 12:15pm. Pt did not seem in any distress at time of injection. After injection, he moved to an observation area chair with armrests. He appeared to have a vaso-vagal response around 12:20pm causing him to pass out and fall out of chair. He hit his head on the floor causing a minor laceration on left eyebrow and some bleeding. He appeared to have some swelling around eyebrow and forehead area. His mother accompanied him and informed us post-injection that this has happened in the past, that he had syncope related events from vaccine. The paramedics were called and the PT was taken to the local hospital for further evaluation.

                                                A couple of days after the vaccine, my lymph nodes in armpits were swollen and neck lymph nodes were swollen for a couple days. It was uncomfortable nut not painful. No fever, no malaise. I did feel nauseous during this time. 2 weeks after my vaccine (around 05/22/2021) I had a weird sensation that my left arm went numb and I couldn&#39;t really control it 100%. I went to the ER because I thought I was having a stroke and because of my experience with Bells Palsy. They didn&#39;t do anything because I was in the lobby waiting for 2-3 hours and they seemed rushed and they told me that I must&#39;ve been sitting in weird position because my arm went numb. They didn&#39;t do any tests.

                                                I got the 2nd dose on 06/06/2021 and then for a couple days after my heart was pounding and I was just tired. I felt tightening in my chest, intermittent pain in upper back. Periodically this would come in waves. My hands felt like pins and needles kind of flushed over my body. It was mainly hands and feet but I would feel it in my face and sometimes arms and legs. I did go to the ER about a week after 2nd dose (around 06/13/2021). They told me it could&#39;ve been anxiety and stress. They did an EKG, blood work, and x-ray and didn&#39;t find anything abnormal. I did f/u with PCP and I just went last week and explained symptoms there as well and they&#39;re looking into my issues. They told me today I had a high white blood cell count and that my liver has elevated enzymes. They want me to come in the middle of July to do more fasting blood work. No fever, no malaise, but I did feel tired and fatigued and nauseous. I had bad brain fog and my body felt like it wasn&#39;t mine. It was like someone took my brain and put inside someone else&#39;s body. 1 week after 2nd dose I had bad sinus pressure behind eyes like my eyes were going to burst out of skull.

                                                30 yo man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED for chest pressure and SOB that started this morning when he woke up. It was a constant 8/10 pressure squeezing at the sides of his sternum with the sensation of a plate pushing down on his sternum, that worsened by taking deep breaths. He had never experienced anything like it before. The pain was neither worsened with exertion nor relieved by rest. It did not change with position, and it did not radiate to his arm/neck. He denies any tenderness to palpation of his chest. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not provide any relief. At time of interview denies SOB and reports decrease in chest tightness to 2/10. CP was significantly relieved with a bolus of normal saline in the ED. Tylenol also effectively reduced his pain. Of note, the patient received the second Moderna COVID vaccine shot 3 days ago. For 2 days after receiving the second shot he experienced fevers, chills, nausea, and intermittent vomiting (10 bouts of non-bloody emesis).

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

Benadryl 37.5 mg oral was administered, and symptoms gradually improved and resolved over the next 10-15 minutes.  Patient did not meet the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis, and epinephrine was not administered while patient was in the office.  Patient never developed respiratory compromise, GI symptoms, or reduced BP/end-organ dysfunction.  Vital signs remained normal and stable following reaction and at the time of resolution of symptoms.  It was recommended that patient go to the ED (by EMS) for monitoring purposes/delayed reaction.  EMS transport was declined by patient.

All &#34;known&#34; side effects so far, but I got all of them essentially simultaneously. I didn&#39;t think I needed to report if it&#39;s under 72 hours since injection since it is all &#34;known&#34; but my mother pressured me to file a report :)  Spo2 levels 95-100, elevated heartrate (90-100), taste and smell are fine, no cough so far

Symptoms mostly subsided on 4/9, so I returned to work at 3:00 pm. By about 5:00 pm, the crest pain returned and worsened until I went home, and then to the hospital around 7:00 pm. Tests were done before I was diagnosed with &#34;acute myocarditis, elevated troponin level, coagulopathy, NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction)&#34;, told I likely had a heart attack, and was put on a Heparin drip and kept for additional testing and observation until 4/11/21 at approximately 5:00 pm.

He reports he has not had any symptoms to the right eye, itself. He states he has some mild facial drooping involving his right upper eyelid and his right cheek. He reports mild swelling under his right eye, as well as to his right cheek area. He also reports that he can?t fully open his right eye, which impairs his field of vision; otherwise, denies any vision changes. Instructed that the symptoms were suggestive of Bell?s Palsy, but to go straight to ER for further evaluation.

Then I had severe migraines and throwing up even though I?ve never had migraines before. This lasted about a week. Then I began to develop painful lymph nodes and got shingles, also something that has never happened before. Shingles healing right as I got second shot on March 5th and had same high fever sick reaction as first week of second shot but with diarrhea this time which I did not have the first time.

A single small ulcerative lesion appeared in the upper soft palate of my mouth so I went to a walk in clinic and had a strep done which was negative. D/t the ulcers appearing in my mouth I had and HIV test done which also came back negative. I had a small low grade fever and muscle aches also associated but the lesion in my mouth is what caused the major concern which slowly resolved over the next few weeks.

                                                On 4/12/21, nearly a week after my first dose of the vaccine, I experienced intense, sharp pains in the left side of my neck. The pain was intermittent throughout the day and didn&#39;t seem to be triggered or alleviated by any specific action, It coincided with a slightly enlarged, hard lymph node along my left external jugular vein, about two inches below my ear lobe. The pain persisted (intermittently) lasting no longer than one to three seconds each time, or in some cases pulsing on and off for 30 seconds. In total, I counted roughly a dozen of these episodes between 4/12 and 4/13. The lymph node has since decreased in size and no longer hurts.

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 31-year-old white male who previously healthy, he works with a maintenance crew, he was in his usual state of health last week, he did receive his 2nd dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on Thursday.  Over the next 24-48 hours he began experiencing myalgias malaise and fatigue, he self treated with ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed.  He felt a little bit better on Sunday and went to assist in picking up a brush more.  During the process he became  short of breath as well as midsternal chest discomfort. He presented to the ED.    Evaluation found a CRP of 112, elevated troponins and a  leukocytosis of approximately 20,000 along with elevated neutrophils.  His influenza a and influenza B testing have been negative and his SARS COVID the PCR was negative.  Given his elevated troponins, he was started on IV heparin and admitted for further evaluation.   On admission to the floor, he was chest pain free. We were concerned for potential myo/pericarditis given his history and laboratory study findings. Cardiac MRI was performed which suggested active myocarditis with biventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 34%, RVEF 37%). Given his new LV dysfunction he was started on low dose lisinopril and metoprolol succinate.  It is unclear whether this is atypical viral myocarditis or whether it potentially could be vaccine related, the MRI is consistent with that of myocarditis. We did not proceed with cardiac biopsy unless since there was no evidence for clinical decompensation, unstable heart rhythm or other worrisome features. He will plan to follow up with Dr. 1 week post hospitalization with repeat echocardiography and blood work.  If at that time there are any signs of instability we would proceed with more aggressive workup at that time.    Infectious disease was consulted who recommended infectious work up including serology testing for: parvovirus IgG and IgM was positive, Herpes Virus type 6, EBV, CMV (undetected) adenovirus, enterovirus (negative) and HIV (negative) .    He does not have any family history of cardiomyopathy.  There is no family history of sudden cardiac death, he states that his family has been quite healthy from a cardiac standpoint he was previously healthy before this episode.

                                                Starting on May 20th or 21st I noticed a pain while putting deodorant on under my left armpit. As I went through the day, I noticed that it started to swell under my arm. As the days went on it got continually worse. On Sunday night, in hopes to get the swelling down used Ice &amp; Heat to try and combat the swelling. It did not work. Today 5/25 the swelling is still there along w pain.

                                                A few hours after the injection, my left arm started to hurt more than expected and decreased my arm mobility for the day. When I try to use it, it caused mild pain. After waking up, my left arm deltoid muscle was visibly swollen and has a medium amount of pain and significantly decreased range of motion. Because this event has not yet resolved, I may seek advice from my primary care doctor later today

About three hours later I began to feel light headed and fatigued. Over night between the 27th and 28th I became feverish, with chills, shaking, and sweating. On the 28th I experienced fatigue, lymph node swelling in my neck and left armpit, and all over body aches. On the 29th I continued to experience fatigue and pain in my lymph nodes. In addition, I began to experience a migraine headache which  persisted for about 30 hours. My symptoms generally abated  by the morning of the 31st .

Blood test showed that I am suddenly highly allergic to 19 different food groups. I have no known food allergies prior to C19 Moderna Vaccine. I have had hives every single day since they 1st appeared (3.5 days after vaccine). I have had multiple days of facial swelling as well and have been to the hospital multiple times. To this date (date of this report) I still have hives and facial swelling. Facial swelling is intermittent. I have stayed away from the list of foods that I am apparently suddenly allergic to and I still have hives and swelling. I occasionally have a irritated throat which makes it difficult to breathe in. I have a specialist appointment with an allergy/immunology doctor this coming Thursday to see what thier diagnosis is. My family doctor believes my potential angioedema diagnosis is directly related to my 1st dose of C19 Moderna Vaccine.

The symptoms felt just like past instances of the flu I&#39;ve had.  Given this, I didn&#39;t go to work on 3/29, and instead went to get a covid test.  On 3/29, I also started to get consistent pain in emanating from the lymph node in my right arm, the same arm I received the vaccine in on 3/22.  The actual vaccine site no longer has any tenderness, and it was never painful after the shot.  I had no symptoms at all between 3/22 and 3/28.  The lymph node under my right arm is visibly swollen as well.  On 3/30, I was given the results of my covid test from 3/29, which was &#34;covid-19 not present.&#34;

The pain then progressed to the right neck and supraclavicular area. He felt throbbing , sore, numbness as well and &#34;shocks&#34;. Over the next view days the pain was shooting down his triceps and numbness and tingling and then numbness in the fourth and fifth fingers. No muscle weakness and no fever or chills. No systemic symptoms. He complained of the tingling numbness and a sense of swelling--all down the right arm in the c6-7 distribution. On April first his wife noted a vesicular rash on the right side of his neck with a few lesions on the right upper back. He was not responding to NSAIDs, ice or heat, immobilization, so at this point the clinical diagnosis of shingles/varicella zoster was made and Valtrex 1000 mg tid was started.

                                                The patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction characterized by throat closing, shortness of breath, cough, and inability to speak due to airway narrowing. The symptoms started at 0800 and were severe enough that he was having difficulty speaking, so he had a friend talk to dispatch. He was given 2 doses of IM epinephrine, 50 mg Benadryl, and 125 mg Solumedrol by EMS and transferred to the ER department at the Community Hospital.

                                                Muscle pain, headache and hard time focusing on daily activities appeared 7 hours after that shot and didn&#39;t go away for nearly 24 hours.  On April 17th, two days after the shot I discovered a large bump (around 4-6 mm) under my skin on my lower neck, on the left side, close to the shoulder. I called a doctor and was advised to observe the bump for a week and schedule an in-person appointment with my doctor if the bump doesn&#39;t go away. The doctor said that it&#39;s most likely a lymph node.

                                                Moderna EUA - Patient who is nonverbal and  received his second COVID vaccine today reportedly developed evidence of discomfort by closing his eyes, gritting his teeth and trying to lay down within 15 minutes of his injection.  This had not occurred w/ his first injection on 4/19/2021.   A medical assistant reported seeing distended right neck and right arm veins, and his family member reported seeing urticaria.  Vitals per MA were bp 97/59, pulse 102, pulse ox 96% on room air.  Upon my arrival, there were no visible distended neck or arm veins, and patient was seated comfortably, upright in the backseat of his family member&#39;s vehicle.  There were horizontal linear indentations across his right neck, as though he had been resting his head against the back of his seat, or a seat belt may have been rubbing on it (but seat belt would have been on wrong side).  He was in no respiratory distress.  There were no visible urticaria.  BP was 115/69, pulse 92.  Lungs were clear to auscultation and cardiovascular exam revealed mild tachycardia, regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  He had received 10 mg of Benadryl through his G tube just as I arrived.    I recommended that patient be observed for 15 more minutes and patient went home without further incident, to go to ER if developed respiratory distress.

He stated he has NKDA and had no reaction to first dose. He also stated that he didn&#39;t know if it was due to vaccine or bug bite. We gave him two Benadryl 25mg tablets and had him sit in waiting room for observation. After 15 minutes, he stated that he felt better , would continue Benadryl and contact doctor if symptoms worsened. I followed up the following day, he stated that reaction resolved completely within five hours.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

It was more tender and there was moderate to sever pain in the armpit. I took some advil with minimal relief. On the 3rd day (today) the swelling seemed a littlw worse and the pain increased slightly. I contacted my plastic surgeon (since back in October 2019) because i had a procedure called miradry, which elemintes the sweat glands in my bilateral armpits. The doctor advised me to come in immeidately to the office. Upon arrival the doctor examined the area and was able to se immiedalty that is was swollen. I consented to pictures being taken. He is making an entry as well as I am and I was advised to ice the area and to take advil and to remain in contact.

The lymph node swelling has subsided a little after 4 days and is no longer painful but the ancillary swelling has not gone down.

                                                2 days after receiving my first dose my tongue began to feel tingly and swell, I could feel the tightness in the back and in my lymph nodes as well. I began to have sensitivity to spicy foods on Thursday. On Friday I woke up and my words were slurring as my tongue felt more swollen  and I started to notice some slight swelling in my throat, maybe 5%. I started gargling diphenhydramine on Friday night and that helped a lot, I also took loratadine and Fexofenadine. By Sunday my symptoms were masked by the allergy drugs and I stopped taking the diphenhydramine. 1 week later, 12 days post Moderna Vaccinne I stopped taking the fexofenadine and Loratadine. I continued to have tongue irritation and a sore on my tongue for 2.5 weeks. I then had an adverse event after the 2nd shot as well.

                                                I noticed swelling on my underarm on the right side beginning mid day yesterday (2021-04-07).  Swelling was not noticeable at first, it was first noticed because of tenderness which continues to today (2021-04-08).  Swelling became noticeable overnight or this morning.  Only slightly tender to direct touch (was initially not at all), most of tenderness is felt from moving arm back to position at side.  No other symptoms.  Sent message to PCP today (2021-04-08) about symptoms but have not heard back.  Currently just observing

                                                My husband got a headache and a rash on his temple, starting the Wednesday after his second shot. His headache and the rash got worse, along with swollen lymph nosed on his neck and head. He went to an urgent care clinic on Saturday, a week after his second Moderna shot, and was diagnosed with shingles. He was given gabapentin, a generic of Valtrex and prednisone.

                                                03/28: At 9 PM (9 hours after shot), I rapidly experienced fatigue, fever (101 degrees), chills, aches, and slight nausea. I took my vitals during this time: SPo2 of 98-99%, BP was 123/80, and heart rate was in the mid-to-high 80s. By midnight, I felt much better and assumed everything was over.   03/29: Woke up feeling fairly tired. As I was trying to do my normal morning routine of cleaning up, taking out trash, etc. I noticed a shortness of breath. No fever or other symptoms from the night before. I checked my SPo2 levels with 3 different oximeters, and all gave readings in the 93%-94% range. My heart rate, which is usually in the 80s and 90s when moving about, was in the low 70s, bottoming at 72. This was nerve racking. This along with intermittent dizziness persisted for 24 hours. I got COVID tested and it came back negative. Flu came back negative, too. A consult with a doctor inferred that &#34;everyone has different vaccine side effects.&#34; Not helpful.   This shortness of breath/fatigue/low blood oxygen saturation continued persistently for the next 48 hours. I was essentially advised to stay home and rest. I noticed some lymph node swelling, too.   By day 4, I was feeling much better. My heart rate had gone back up into the 80s, and my blood oxygen sat. had increased to 96-97%. I was still somewhat tired and got winded very, very easily.   It&#39;s been over two weeks since my second shot upon writing this. I didn&#39;t want to report, but I can&#39;t make heads or tails as to why this happened. The only change in my health was taking the vaccine. I don&#39;t have any blood clots, asthma, or underlying issues. However, these side effects, if they are as such, need to be discussed. I know others who got the Moderna vaccine with similar anecdotes. The difference is, living with a clinician, I monitor my vitals all the time and knew enough to take measurements.

It&#39;s been about five days, and it seems to have gone down / that pain has largely subsided. Additionally, both upper arms feel &#34;heavy&#34; and my hands are weak. It&#39;s not as easy to make a fist. It&#39;s hard to describe, but my arms just feel a little weaker.

However, the site of the injection on my left arm has turned red. I would say it is a red circle with a radius of 1.5-inch around the injection location. It is painful when pressed on. Also my left armpit (lymph nod) is swollen and is painful. Hopefully I won&#39;t die :/

                                                Delayed reaction to the vaccine that began 6 days after first dose and persisted for approximately 3 days. I first became itchy on my abdomen and arms, I then developed flat oval hives and my eyes and upper lip began swelling. My throat did not swell. I took 2 Benadryl that evening that helped the itch and caused the facial swelling to subside somewhat. I slept thru the night and when the Benadryl wore off in the morning, the same symptoms returned. I took 1 Benadryl which again calmed the symptoms. The same symptoms returned in the evening and I went to an Urgent Care. I was prescribed Prednisone and more Benadryl. These medicines helped to calm the symptoms even more, but the itchiness and hives did come and go thru the next day. On day 3 I took Zyrtec in addition to my last dose of Predisone and the itchiness subsided completely. I took one more dose of Zyrtec the next day and the symptoms have not returned. I followed up with my PCM who tested for a Hazelnut allergy as I had eaten them that first night. She also referred me to an Allergist. I saw the Allergist who said in their opinion my immune system was having a reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and classified me as &#34;medium risk&#34; for the second dose. He recommended that I still get the second dose and to premeditate with Zyrtec the night before, day of and for 7 days following.

                                                On Day 6 post vaccination, noticed slight tenderness near injection site. On Day 7 a rash developed and it was warm to the touch. On Day 8, some pain developed in addition. On Day 9, the rash grew in size and was itchy. On Day 10, it was almost cleared up. On Day 11, it appeared gone, On Day 12, the rash *re-appeared* but had grown in size. On Day 13, the rash was even bigger - had spread further down my arm. By Day 14, it had almost disppeared.  On Day 5, I noticed a swollen lymph node near my left clavicle. On Day 6, this lymph node had swelled and now there was pain. I also experienced slight discomfort under my left armpit. The pain associated with the clavicle lymph node lasted until Day 8. As of Day 14, the lymph node is still swollen.

                                                Inflammation started on the right and left sides of my neck two days after the shot. The pain was dull and lasted for about two days. The pain then moved to the middle of my back at the spine and blades of my lower back shoulders. The pain has lasted for a little over a week now and has lessened over time but is still noticeable. If I tried to sneeze or inhale deeply, this was difficult due to the discomfort I felt in my back and the sides of my neck.

Second, 7 days after vaccination, itchy and hot area of hives developed around the injection spot and slowly grew  into a 6 inch circle. Third, at the same time with the second symptom, I am having a mild sciatic pain in my right leg.  Symptom 1 has subsided, and symptoms 2 and 3 are still present, but seem to have slowed down.

Pain radiating to testicles.  Entire body aching.  Couldn&#39;t find comfortable position to sit/stand/walk.   Worse than any illness I&#39;ve had, but without the brain fog Within next 48 hours: Armpit swollen on right arm (same as vaccine arm).  Pain in head persisting.  Pain behind ears.  Dizzy/lightheaded feeling. Third Day after vaccine: Armpit is still swollen.  Headache persists.  Ache in muscles and joints seem to be re-emerging.  But, overall, I&#39;m fine and can work today. Note: Pollen count high - and I typically do get headaches from pollen - so, headaches could be attributable to pollen, but timing is suspicious.

But the welt is still there, and I feel the swelling more so now than I did last night. It&#39;s now been about 38 hours since receiving vaccine. It doesn&#39;t seem to be getting worse, aside from now being able to feel the swelling. Also, like I said, the blister-like bumps, on the welt/swelled area, have dissipated, so that got better. My face is also breaking out with acne since the shot. I do occasionally get acne break outs tho.

                                                The patient received his 2nd dose of Moderna (LOT#, site, time unavailable) at an outside clinic the morning of 2/10/21 and presented to the ED with coughing and hypoxia (sp02 occasionally dropping into 70&#39;s) at 8 PM that day.  He had quadriplegic spinal paralysis as a result of a remote MVA and has been hospitalized and critically ill in the past due to recurrent UTI&#39;s and pneumonia with associated sepsis.   CT negative for pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral infiltrates.  Clinical presentation consistent with bilateral pneumonia and started on Rocephin/azithromycin.  He was initially stable in the hospital on 1-2 LPM 02.  The following evening he became febrile and acutely developed asystole without any pre-existing arrhythmia.  Resuscitation was attempted for 45 minutes but unsuccessful.  Overall, I suspect his death was related to bacterial pneumonia and resulting acute respiratory failure, complicated by his quadriplegia and autonomic dysreflexia but reported this event as it did occur within 2 days of receiving his 2nd Moderna vaccination.

In addition, I developed a rash on my arm and was bedridden. I took a small walk that day and proceeded to swell up on the left side of my body but it subsided within a few hours. The next day, I suffered a stroke due to blot clotting and the clot flowing to my brain. I had to go to the hospital and was there for a few days.

I called 911 as I had trouble breathing and an ambulance took me to the hospital and administred epinephrine and benadryl. They called it analphlatic shock or extreme allergic reaction.

Only mildly itchy unless scratched - then they become extremely itchy with burning sensation. Skin issues still present, but discomfort relieved by antihistamine (generic Zyrtec). Ibuprofen/lotion/etc had no effect. I believe it was a delayed vaccine reaction because I?ve never needed antihistamines before in my entire life - no known ?true allergies? (just significant GI issues with eurythromycin, so I avoid it).

It felt like indigestion. Pain stayed mild until Saturday evening when I started vomiting and had diarrhea and by 11:00 pm I went to the ER where they did bloodwork and a ct scan. Bloodwork showed high white blood cell count, scan showed appendicitis. After 4.5 hours there, I had to leave to go to another hospital and wait for a bed. After being in intense pain for a few more hours, I finally had the emergency surgery at 11:00 am Sunday the 9th.

He said about 45 minutes after he received the vaccination, he started experiencing chest pains. He went to the  emergency room. He said they did 2 E.K.G&#39;s, 2 chest X-rays, and blood work.  He said they could not find the cause. He said the day after the vaccination he started experiencing shortness of breath and 1 week after the vaccination he started having swelling of the extremities.  He said his doctor doesn&#39;t know if the vaccination is the cause but warned him not to get the 2nd dose. He says to this day he still experiences a dull ache in his chest, shortness of breath and swelling of the extremities.  He said he is seeking treatment from a cardiologist. He said he is concerned about myocarditis.

                                                Guillain Barre syndrome/AIDP event. Paresthesia and nerve pain developed in bilateral legs 4 hours after shot and progressed slowly for 4 days in intensity and area involved. Symptoms progressed distally to superior. On the 5th day symptoms progressed rapidly and involved bilateral legs up to the groin, left arm up to lateral shoulder, and right hand. I went to the hospital and was admitted to start IVIG treatment for Guillain Barre Syndrome/AIDP.

                                                Then this past Tuesday (03-23-2021) I went to receive the 2nd Covid-19 Moderna Vaccine at 1:00pm. I felt fine and had no adverse after this vaccination until 8:30pm the same day. At this time I started to have sever  itching and within an hour the itching was over my entire body. It was a mixture of hives and regular pruritus/itching and areas of swelling throughout my body. This lasted all through the night into Wednesday, 03-24-21. Around the same time as the itching started Tuesday night, my Spinal joints, Hip joints, shoulder joints, knee joints, wrist and ankles became severely inflamed and very painful. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst pain, at the highest I was at a 9.    On Wednesday, I went in to my Primary Care for the itching and the pain. My PCP is on vacation this week, so I saw his Colleague. Dr. visibly recognized the redness from the itching all over my body, along with the extreme pain to my joints and gave me a thorough examination. After his examination  he spoke to another physician who stepped in and also gave me an exam. Dr. advised the other Dr. and me of  his initial hesitancy  sending me home, wanting me to be observed overnight at the Hospital. After going to their Emergency Room. They gave me the choice but I truly thought it would go away over the course of the usual 24 hours post Vaccination; I also did not want to be exposed to any virus/sickness I might encounter/pick up in the Hospital due to my lowered immune system because of the rheumatoid arthritis injection Humira I take bi-monthly.. I explained that I was living with my mom, and our residence is 7 minutes from the Hospital, Emergency Room.) I assured both Physicians if it got worse, my mother would take me to the ER. So instead of going to Hospital, they prescribed a Hydrocortisone Cream of  2.5% for the itching, kept me on oral Benadryl and told me to stay hydrated. Also, Dr. said if it wasn?t better and/or worse Thursday(03/25/21)to come back in for re-evaluation. Along with the medications for itching, they prescribed a dose of pain medicine: Tylenol(APAP) #4 - or Acetaminophen with 60mg of Codeine.    Yesterday - Thursday(03-25-2021) I was no better, and had to go back in to the Clinic.  I was seen by Dr., who also believed this reaction to be based on the Humira along with my immune system naturally being lowered due to the AS and RA medication. Dr. examined me, as by yesterday my hands/fingers were hurting as well and itching was not any better. He prescribed Atarax (Hydroxyzine) 50mg Cap to be taken 3 times per day for the awful Pruritis, which has caused me to scratch so badly that I?ve had some bleeding from areas on my body, near the larger joints and spine. And also changed the Tylenol #4 to every 4 hours, basically more often for the pain associated.    Adding the Hydroxyzine for the itch along with the Hydrocortisone, pain medication and time since Tuesday?s final vaccine, has helped a bit. Today, Friday, I am feeling less itchy but still having quite a bit of joint pain, but less than Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  Because of the itching and joint/spine pain I received very little sleep until last evening when I was able to rest and not itch or toss and turn from pain. Hopefully on the mend.

It went away after an hour. The next day, I was moving around and this time my face, stomach, waist, hands feet, legs,, and back,,went red and was very itchy. Itchiness seemed to start in the palms of my hands first then, moved all over my body. Started seeing bumps raise up on the tops of my hands and stomach. After I stopped moving around it slowly subsided. This has been going on for 4 days. Any time I move around vigorously, seems to trigger the reaction. Latent itchiness all over most of my body after the swelling and redness/bumps go away. Taking Benedryl 2x a day per PCP recommendation. Following up within 4 days if it doesn&#39;t improve.

                                                Continuing peripheral neuropathy. On 4/21 I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm and within two minutes had a vasovagal reaction?tingling in my underarm, flush feeling face and stiffness and tingling in my upper lips.  That mostly subsided within 30 minutes as the dull arm pain set in.  Over the next 7 days my arm pain intensified some and moved up my shoulder and down my triceps and into my elbow. 4/28 I awoke with numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle finger of my shot (right) arm in addition to the arm pain and neck and shoulder muscle tightness. 5/8 Arm pain and finger numbness still present, I did some yard work that exacerbated the arm pain, and at this point it was the first day I recognized the pain as a specific intense nerve pain from my shoulder, down my triceps, across my forearm and into my pointer and middle fingers. From this point on the nerve pain and finger numbness/tingling persisted and included intermittent cold forearm/fingers. 5/11 Met with my primary physician who diagnosed me with cervical radiculopathy (C7). Prescribed physical therapy, prednisone and flexeril. 5/12 Had a massage w/aroma therapy, cryotherapy, and cupping. Provided some relaxation, but no change in nerve pain or symptoms. 5/14 First day of PT; neck and arms stretches, neck traction and nerve glides 5/17 Completed Medrol dose pack, steroids seemingly had no effect. Flexeril at night helped relax neck and shoulder muscles a bit. 5/20 (Today) Still have numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle fingers with specific nerve pain down my triceps, elbow, across forearm and into my two fingers that intensifies with activity and at night.  Intermittent cold sensation in right hand, underarm inflammation and tenderness, and general weakness of right hand and arm.

                                                A 36-year-old gentleman seen today in consultation for further evaluation of unusual reaction following 1st coronavirus vaccine.  He received Moderna recombinant MRNA vaccine on 12/24.  On about 01/02, he developed a maculopapular pruritic rash that he refers to as hives present over the dorsum of both hands and predominantly right side of the face.  He had some facial swelling.  No breathing difficulties or other symptoms.  He does not recall any rash, aches, fever.  A few days later, he went in to the Community Health Clinic and received some prednisone for this, a 5-day course, and apparently, symptoms resolved by about day 4.  No further problems, but he is wondering if he should receive 2nd vaccine.  Again, no immediate symptoms of any importance following 1st Moderna dose on 12/24.   No clear history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, eczema, bee sting allergy or food hypersensitivity.  No problems with previous vaccines.  He is even wondering if the vaccine and rash reaction are related and this is difficult to prove with any certainty.

On day 8 the site began getting extremely itching and has swollen for three days and now has redness and rash on site of injection and is extremely warm to touch and itchy. Patient hasn?t reported to doctor yet as unknown whether this side effect is expected or whether it warrants doctor visit but patient wants adverse event to be known.  Patient doesn?t consider this adverse to be severe yet but somewhere between minor and moderate adverse reaction.

                                                Patient developed sudden onset vertigo with recurrent vomiting. He was brought to the emergency department and was evaluated under the stroke protocol and underwent CT, CTA, and MRI of the brain which did not reveal an etiology of his symptoms. He had a neurology consultation and the most likely cause was thought to be vestibular neuritis on the left side. He was treated with Zofran, Reglan, Meclizine, IV fluids, and Valium with partial relief and was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Symptoms are unresolved at the time of this report.

                                                3 days after I received my 2nd dose of Moderna Vaccine at the same facility (Which I received on 4/16/2021), I&#39;ve had a series of what could be panic attacks.  1 on 4/19/21, 1 on 4/30/21, then another on 5/8/21, which then continues to stay with me on a milder intensity, but is lasting still today.   In my previous 4 years of working, I&#39;ve only missed a less than a 1 handful of days of work due to health conditions, but suddenly after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine, I&#39;ve had a myriad of what I initially thought were heart attacks where I was unable to drive to work (had to pull over twice on the road due to serious risk of being in an accident / having unprovoked panic attacks the morning of  4/19/21 and 5/8/21).  Had extreme SOB and could seriously considered calling 911 on all 3 of my first episodes.  Went to Urgent Care on 5/10/21, and have had several phone visits with my primary care physician since then and was placed on medical leave until 5/22/21, although I still am experience some side effects even today.

Patient had also had other symptoms (fevers, aches, chest discomfort/cough) in the few days after the vaccines that had resolved.  I consulted with our ID specialist, who saw the pt on 4/16/21, and at that time only left axillary fullness was noted.

He did not respond to call/touch. Pharmacist ran out to give EpiPen, then laid patient down onto the floor with his legs up onto the chair while the tech called 911. EMS came and took it over. Patient however denied to go to hospital.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

Symptoms receded by the 11th day.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

Also had some fatigue that seemed to accompany this, though that could have been a coincidence with many late night interruptions to my sleep schedule because of on-call responsibilities at that time.

                                                Within five minutes of the vaccination, the patient expressed distress.  Patient was slumped over in his seat, extremely labored breathing and his eyes were rolling to the back of his head.  The Pharmacist spoke to the patient to see how he was feeling but he wasn&#39;t very responsive so we administered an Epipen and immediaetly called 911.  The paramedics came at around 6:20pm and checked the patients vitals. EMT said the patients vitals were normal and have the patient the option to go to the ER.  Patient was alert and able to drink water.   Patient refused hospitalization.  We advised the patient to go directly to the emergency room if he was developing any symptoms once home and to follow up with his primary care provider.

The next day Thursday 1/7/21, I noticed intermittent heart flutter/palpitations. I had my routine morning coffee and I thought the combination of the vaccine and the coffee might be the caused.  The flutter/palpitations continue to the present. I don&#39;t have shortness of breath. The left deltoid pain and swelling subsided. The flutter is intermittent and last 10 to 15 seconds.

The lymph nodes swelled to roughly marble to golf ball sized protrusions in the occipital region of my head. This swelling as also accompanied by more swelling on the top right side of my head and also my skin began to break due to the swelling. Extreme headaches and swelling only started to subside on the right side of the back of my head after I received a steroid shot at an urgent care clinic. The steroid did not diminish the swelling and extreme pain on the right side of my head. A few days after this, I went to another urgent care clinic which diagnosed me some kind of infection due to the swelling and then prescribed me topical and oral antibiotics. As I right this, over three weeks from my first dose, I have scabbing and still some pain in the right side of my head.

During this time, he saw ENT for a chronic cough pre-dating his first shot and underwent CT to rule out sinus disease which revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. He then underwent 2nd dose and had exact same constellation of symptoms along with worsening of cervical lymphadenopathy and has persistent lymphadenopathy on exam at the time of consultation with infectious disease 3/16/2021) albeit symptoms and lymph nodes are improving.

The next morning, March 25, 2021, I began to feel body aches, chills, and I was in a cold sweat. I took ibuprofen throughout the day to combat the symptoms. The evening of March 25, 2021, the pain was much more severe (body aches all over my body, including my face, teeth, my hands were sore and stiff, etc.). I did not sleep much of the night because the symptoms were very uncomfortable due to the chills and cold sweats. The morning of March 26, 2021, my left armpit began to swell. By the afternoon, my left armpit (the arm where I received the vaccine) was swollen, tender, and soft. There is some redness and the swelling and tenderness are more pervasive. It is difficult to hang my arm at my side due to the pain and swelling. I understand, after calling the nurse hotline, that this is a common side effect but I also have a skin condition (Hidradenitis Supparativa) and it is difficult to know whether flare-ups are triggered by environmental factors.

On 11 Jan 2021, seven days prior to the onset of the event, the patient received first of their two planned doses of mRNA-1273 in the left arm for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s left ankle and leg started swelling. Healthcare professional performed an X ray and other analysis on the patient but didn&#39;t find anything. The patient  was treated with prednisone and the symptoms went away but when they stopped treating with prednisone the symptoms came back. Patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing.  Healthcare professional showed his concern as he doesn&#39;t know what was happening to the patient. The patient was advised by his physician not to received the second dose.  Treatment for the events inluded predisone and Ibuprofen.  The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the events.   The events, patient&#39;s left ankle and leg starting swelling, were considered not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                In addition to the (common) side effect of chills and body aches, at around 75 hours after getting the shot I developed extreme gas pains and nausea while running, and barely made it home, collapsing on our floor.  I then suffered severe diarrhea (which had not been listed as a possible side-effect).  It is now five days out, and the diarrhea appears to have abated.  But I continue to have lower abdominal bloating and discomfort.  (I also have painful swollen lymph nodes under the armpit of injection, as I did after the first dose, for at least a week.) Note: These gastrointestinal symptoms are NOT like those I suffer from with gastric dysmotility, which affects my upper GI tract.

Also, bouts of diarrhea  all week (not too unusually, hence possible dairy allergy referenced above).

                                                On Friday, April 2nd, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  Within minutes, my heart started racing and I felt faint.  Thereafter, my hands and face got the sensation of tingling.  It felt like ice was running through my veins.  My heart stopped racing approximately fifteen or so minutes after it began.  The tingling sensation in my hands and face ended approximately one hour later.  I also noticed a strange taste in my mouth during this same timeframe.  Subsequently, I had the sensation of being dizzy and lightheaded.  Importantly, I have never reacted to a vaccine in this manner.  On Saturday, April 3rd, I woke up with symptoms that were to be expected.  My arm was very sore and I felt a little achy.  However, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded.    That evening and for the next week or so, my heart was beating rapidly, and my blood pressure was elevated.  I also had the continuous feeling of my skin crawling.  My hands and feet also seemed to be experiencing tremors and twitching.    On Sunday, April 4th, I woke up and noticed that my right eye seemed a little blurry as I read an article on my phone.  I assumed I must have slept on my eye wrong and did not pay it much attention.  I do not recall my eye being blurry for the rest of the day.  The following morning on Monday, April 5th, I woke up once again feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  As I walked to the restroom, I noticed that my right eye was blurry again.  This time it seemed to be more pronounced.  Moreover, when I closed my right eye, I could see hundreds of dots in different colors.  In addition to having blurry vision, my legs felt weak and nearly buckled as I walked.  I felt like I was intoxicated.  Upon returning to bed, my teeth began chattering and I felt like I was freezing.  I called my doctor?s office and spoke with a PA who recommended that I go to the ER.    While I checked in at the ER, I could not remember my ZIP code.  I felt like my brain was not running on all cylinders.  Upon explaining my symptomology to the ER doctor, she recommended that I have my blood drawn and that I get an MRI to rule out a stroke.  All test results came back normal.    On Wednesday, April 7th, I made an appointment with an allergist.  They tested me to see if I was allergic to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polysorbate 80.  For the skin scratch portion of the test, neither of the substances had much of a reaction on my skin.  I thought the Polysorbate 80 scratch had a little bit of redness to it, but it was negligible.  When the doctor injected Polysorbate 80 under my skin with a syringe, a welt formed.  I am not sure why, but PEG was not injected in the same manner.  As a result of the test, the allergist confirmed that I am allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He mentioned that there may be instances of cross reactivity to PEG for individuals that are allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He recommended that I not get the second Moderna dose unless it was administered in a controlled setting.    On Sunday April 11th, I noticed what felt like a hard vein in my abdominal fat.  It felt slightly tender to the touch.  I was fearful that it could be a clot.  On Tuesday, April 13th, I woke up and as a I stood in the shower, my foot was painful to stand on.  On top of my right foot near my ankle, I could visibly see red inflammation in a vein.  I massaged the vein and the redness and pain dissipated.  Being fearful that I did have blood clots, I scheduled an appointment with a PA at my doctor?s office that same day.  We discussed my ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and me being fearful of blood clots.  She had an EKG performed at the office and ordered a barrage of blood tests.  Everything continued to be normal.    On Sunday, April 18th, I again went to the ER, because the hard vein in my stomach became larger and more tender to the touch.  When I bent over, it felt like there was a lot of pressure emanating from the hard vein down to my groin.  Once again, blood was drawn and everything was normal.  I also had an ultrasound performed on the area that felt like a hard vein and the doctor concluded that it was most likely swollen lymph nodes.  I was diagnosed with lymphadenopathy.    On Monday, April 26th, I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss the ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and pain in my stomach and groin area.  He told me that he had seen other patients that were experiencing similar symptoms and that my immune system was possibly overreacting to the vaccine.  He told me the symptoms should go away in time.  He also ordered a new blood test to check for clots.  The D-Dimer test came back normal.    On Tuesday, April 27th, I experienced a painful genital herpes outbreak.  I normally get one every year.  I had just recovered from an infection in December of 2020.  This outbreak was more intense and for the first time I had nerve pain that wrapped around my hip and down my inner thigh.  As of a week later, the infection is almost gone.      Today is May 4th, and I am still experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness.  Some days are better than others and every time I get optimistic that my dizziness and lightheadedness is finally gone, it reappears.  Being an IT consultant business owner and an attorney, I need to think clearly for my profession.  The side effects from the Moderna vaccine have made it very difficult to function.  I would like to get fully vaccinated, but I am fearful of getting the second shot.  I do not want the vaccine to cause permanent neurological damage or worse.    Finally, I am sure your organization is aware, but there are many other people experiencing the same symptoms as me.

Cyclobenzaprine and Methylprednisolone  were prescribed to help on 1/25/2021.  He was then prescribed some lidocaine patches on 02/17/2021.  Finally he was prescribed celecoxib for pain and inflammation on 02/25/2021.  His symptoms have lasted for about 3 months and with the help of the celecoxib his pain is not there anymore.

                                                I started with an itchy rash on my legs behind my knees. AT first I thought it was just bug bites, then it popped up on both my elbows, my hands and my feet. On my hands it was really swollen. It began a few days after my vaccination, I don&#39;t know exactly when. I contacted the DR on 28th or 29th of January, I can&#39;t remember the exact dates. The DR gave me cortisone as well as clobetasol and betamethasone (creams).The rashes went away in about a week after having medications.

                                                3 weeks after initial dose (4/23/2021), I started experiencing dizziness and a constant mild headache. With the dizziness, there was no visual perception of moving or spinning objects and no proprioception problems. The dizziness is more like a sense of being unsteady and an inability to maintain balance. The feeling has never gone away and persists in any position. On different occasions, many times per hour, there is a sweeping feeling that is never in a persistent direction. On the first day of symptoms, the headache was moderate with a feeling of facial puffiness with an elevated blood pressure near hypertensive crisis levels... which was on a Sunday. The following Wednesday morning, I visited the Emergency room at 0034 EST 5/19/2021 because the dizziness was not getting better. A review of systems was performed with no abnormal results. EKG was normal. Cranial CT scan showed no indications of stroke either although I have not looked at it myself yet.  Blood sugar level was at 90. Chem12 test was normal.  Well for more details, please contact me. Session is about to time out and I don&#39;t know how to extend it on my phone.  I have tried vestibular therapy motions. None improved the dizziness. I also have intermittent fog and below normal focus capacity.

Patient noticed on day 4 (6/8) that he has a swollen, inflamed lymph node on the right inside of his mouth. Patient is still experiencing loss of taste and smell, and still experiencing swollen lymph node in mouth.

After getting the 2nd dose, I got sick the same way as the first dose. I was very cold and very weak. Thursday and Friday I&#39;m very sick. I felt fine Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, my right arm swelled up so much that it couldn&#39;t handle it&#39;s own weight. The pain got really bad and I had to go back to the dr. I get naproxen sodium to take with Tylenol. Thankfully that worked. My arm still didn&#39;t work until later that Tuesday evening. I would not have been able to make it to the Dr. if I had to drive myself. The doctor called it Moderna arm and said it was something he has seen a lot of. Here is when I find out that something is not right. My mind starts getting trouble. If we went through the same thing in the winter, my heater would not be able to keep the house warm enough. I hear about the booster and I just know I can&#39;t handle it. I am not sure what to do about that.

                                                On April 1, 2021 the symptoms presented with right shoulder pain. Over the course of several days bilateral paralysis presented in the lower extremities.  On April 6, paralysis occurred in both hands/forearms. Then on April 7, bilateral facial paralysis was noted and was instructed to go to the local ER by PCP. A MRI of the brain and cervical region W/WO Contrast was performed along with spinal tap. On April 8, after a repeat MRI of the brain and cervical region, a diagnoses of Guillan Barre Syndrome was provided. April 8- April 12, 2021 IVIG therapy was administered while staying in the hospital. After the infusions were completed, I was moved to inpatient rehabilitation center on April 13. During my stay in the rehab unit I completed extensive therapy with OT/PT/SP along with neurophysiologist. I was discharged from hospital Rehab unit on April 22, 2021 (am). After discharge I was sent home and advised to continue outpatient therapy. I currently have paralysis in both legs, lower arms/hands, and right side of my face. I have been seeing a neruoopthamologist for my right eye as it can not close and is at risk for going blind. Currently I have not been given any sort of outcomes or time line as to when my condition should improve.

                                                Moderna Covid - 19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on Wednesday January 6th. EARLY Friday morning around 30 minutes after midnight - I noticed pain on my left shoulder / neck area (tenderness). I began to feel around and found a swollen lymph node at the base of my neck just inside my left collar bone. Seems to be the supraclavical lymphnodes. I also noticed tenderness under my left arm in the arm pit region. I received the injection on the left side.

                                                Besides the usual and expected muscle pain, injection site soreness, and headache, I experienced a mild allergic reaction. Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Lot#, handwritten), I experienced a mild swelling of my face and throat. I noticed the throat swelling when I drank water and also noticed my face tightening up. I have a severe allergic reaction to peaches, so I&#39;m hypersensitive to these types of reactions, and I was a little worried.  My throat and face were swollen for about an hour, but very mild compared to my reaction to peaches,  and it subsided after about 2 hours or so.

Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

I also had a number of large hives acrss my right bicep and elbow, as well as a few smaller hives on my back and underneath my feet.    This reaction was the same reaction I received when I went to the ER on 12/10/2018 for difficulty breathing and an elevated BP.  The ER administered TORODOL and I reacted the same way, ending up in the ER the very next day due to the reaction.    I believe, after much diligent research, the reaction I received to the COVID vaccine was due to the Tromethamine in it, as this ingredient is also in TORODOL.

The patient had a medical history of celiac disease and is a kidney patient (other kidney surgically removed). The reporter states that Patient&#39;s concomitant medications are gabapentin and duloxetine hydrochloride for chronic back pain.  On 11 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (unknown lot number) via intamuscular route on left arm for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On 11 Mar 2021, anaphylaxis 3 minutes post receiving the first dose of vaccine the patient developed numbness and his eyes became swollen, then numbness of the tongue, lips and closing of the throat, which all happened at the vaccination site.The attending EMT provided 3 pills of oral 50mg Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and did not apply an EpiPen. Patient&#39;s blood pressure went extremely high (180/111mmHg) instead of dropping. At that moment, it was decided to contact 911. The paramedics placed the patient on a stretcher and loaded him onto the emergency vehicle to be rushed to the hospital. On the way, the patient was given an EpiPen. While in the hospital, the patient was given more diphenhydramine and injected with methylprednisolone. Patient was in observation for 4 hours and then released with a prescription of an EpiPen. It was reported that the patient was extremely sleepy due to the medications given. When the patient arrived home, he went straight to bed. The patient was hospitalized on 11 Mar 2021 for Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Pruritus and released on same day after 4 hours. The next day, Friday (12 Mar 2021) the patient got up around 10:00am. Then at 10:05am, the symptoms began to reoccur with numbness of the lips, tongue, closing of throat and extreme itchiness. As soon as patient&#39;s husband noticed, he did not apply EpiPen and drove the patient to the emergency room. The emergency room followed the same protocol with methyprednisolone steroid, EpiPen and diphenhydramine. On Saturday (13 Mar 2021) and Sunday (14 Mar 2021), the doctor was seen and the patient was advised to take diphenhydramine every 4 hours. Then this past Monday (15 Mar 2021), patient started developing shortness of breath and a resting heart rate of 135bmp. That day, the patient was taken to urgent care.  There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal. On Monday (22 Mar 2021), patient is scheduled to see a cardiologist who will place the patient on a machine to check his heart rate for 3 days to see what is going on. Follow-up with various health care providers was scheduled for the rest of the week. Nephrologist will be seen on Monday, Neurologist will be seen on Tuesday, and Kaiser will be visited on Wednesday. Reporter stated that even though asked to run bloodwork and images, the emergency room did not do it.  Lab work was performed on Monday (15 Mar 021) which came back normal. A check for blockage of the heart, also had looked fine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Tachycardia, Heart rate increased, and Dyspnoea was unknown.

                                                Extreme pain in heels of both feet within 24hr of vaccine injection.  Difficulty walking and standing. Constant pain in both feet during daytime and nighttime.  Particularly acute pain in morning after sleep.  After 1-2 weeks, pain remained in heels of both feet, but also migrated into lower ankles.  Swelling was present from the beginning of the episode, but increased over time.  Pain and swelling abated 3 weeks after first vaccine dose for about a week.  Second vaccine dose occurred 3-29-21 and pain/swelling returned.  Pain in heels was still present at this time, but majority of pain migrated to ankles and achilles regions.  Swelling increased by week 5 to become obvious Edema.  Acupuncture did not help.  Stretching did not help.  Rest and elevating feet did not help.  Magnesium supplement may have helped relieve pain, but I am unsure. Compression sock did not help. Ibuprofen did relieve pain but not swelling.  By week 9, no relief from symptoms.  Podiatrist x-rayed affected areas and found no structural issues, but was concerned with Edema.  Administered steroid dosepack for 6 days.  Symptoms immediately abated.  No symptoms as of today.

Two days later on 6/2, he developed left flank pain and fevers.  On 6/4, he was evaluated in the ED, with CT scan showing partially occlusive thrombosis of left renal artery with areas of renal infarction. Cr remained stably at baseline. Initial workup was otherwise notable for WBC 17 and negative infectious workup. He was initiated on therapeutic Lovenox.  On 6/5, CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed to evaluate for other clots. Left renal artery was complete thromboses with evolving foci of renal infarction. No other clots were detected. He continued to have fevers. By 6/8, his leukocytosis, fever, and flank pain resolved.  Renal ultrasound with doppler showed restoration of some flow in the left renal artery. He is to be discharged 6/9 on Lovenox 1mg/kg BID without patient Hematology follow-up.  His coagulability workup was notable for positive LAC, FVII deficiency, and PET/CT without evidence of occult malignancy.
