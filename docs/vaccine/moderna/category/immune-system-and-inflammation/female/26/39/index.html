                                                I received my first dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on 12/29 at 12:40p at Medical Center in my left deltoid. I am a registered nurse at the facility. Starting on 12/30 when I woke up, I had a mild headache. The headache is lingering and intermittent. Starting 1/3, I have a swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit (the same side I received the vaccine). My employer is sending me for a COVID-19 PCR today to rule out any active infection. Tylenol has been taken as needed for the headache.

                                                Beginning 1/11/2020, I began experiencing an uncomfortable sensitivity in my left axilla. I have a history of  inflamed lymph nodes that occurs 1-2 times a year under the arm and in the groin, and this felt similar to those episodes. The lymph node is hard to touch and the sensitivity continues today. Today (1/13/2020), I noticed an inflamed, red patch of skin that is hot to touch over the region where the injection occurred. Additionally, I have experienced diarrhea 1-2x/day for the past two days.

It is itchy, but doesn&#39;t hurt. It only gets swollen if I itch it and it also gets hot when I itch it. I went and saw my doctor and she prescribed me a topical steroid cream. I have been feeling lightheaded, fatigued and dizzy. That started Thursday January 7.

                                                Two days following administration of vaccine, there was a small, oval shaped redness at injection site about the size of index finger. However, the following day that redness resolved/barely noticeable. Yesterday (1/13/21), I noticed while showering in the morning a huge hard lump on my upper Left arm with circular redness the a little smaller than palm of my hands. The red area grew hotter throughout the day and started to swell. I applied Benadryl gel and took 2 Benadryl 25 mg each in the evening. I tried icing the area as a well. This morning, the hardness and redness are both there. No improvement but it has not worsened either. I tried going to UrgentCare to have it checked out, but was turned away because they didn?t want to be responsible for treating this. I contacted my hospital that gave me this vaccine and they directed me to another clinic, which I may or may not be able to go to because it is a little far from my location. I will continue icing, applying the gel cream, and take a Benadryl   Of note, I had no prior COVID exposure. Following any vaccine, I usually get minor fever/chill (like with Flu shot) which happened with Moderna vaccine as well. But that subsided by the next evening. No fever/chills since then. I also had the commonly reported arm soreness for few days. I have pictures of how the swelling and redness looked like throughout all this as well.

On Friday, (1/15) I noticed that the left-side lymph node in neck/collar bone area was swollen. The area felt similarly to that of a cyst. Starting Friday night, I began taking amoxicillin to prevent a bacterial infection. The swelling/cyst like bump on my neck/collarbone has decreased in size, but the vaccination sight has become very red, swollen, and itchy at times.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received my first dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 15th. My arm was a little sore that day and the next, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad. Late on Saturday, January 16th I noticed a rash around my neckline/collar bone area that was on both sides, but more prominent on the right. The rash was red with many bumps that were not raised and were not fluid filled or blistering. The next day, Sunday (17th) the rash seemed to worsen but stay localized to that area. Monday morning (18th) I woke up with a tender right armpit indicating to me that I have a swollen lymph node. I noticed later that morning that the rash had spread bilaterally to my biceps and chest. Today is Wednesday the 20th, and while the rash looks slightly better around my neckline, the rash has now spread all over my breasts, abdomen, and a little bit to my hips. The right arm pit continues to be tender today.  I took Benadryl (25 mg) Sunday night (17th) and applied hydrocortisone cream to the rash when it was just along my neckline.

                                                Two days after the shot in Colorado I began to develop a rash on my right arm at the injection site.  I had flown back to North Carolina where I am on a student rotation at a hospital the day after the vaccine (Sunday 1/17).  Since then (Monday 1/18) the rash has expanded to my entire upper arm and is continuing to extend downwards.  I had swelling for about a day but that went away.  I had some swollen lymph nodes in my axilla and neck but they are no longer swollen.  Now my arm remains extremely itching and red.  I went to the ED this evening and they gave me IV Solumedrol, Pepcid, and famotidine.  The rash went away except for outside of a line of demarcation we made earlier in the day.  This morning I woke up with an intense itching in the arm.  I rubbed my hand over it (didn?t itch it) and the redness  came right back.  It is continuing to expand down my arm.

                                                Roughly 10 hours after receiving the 2nd Moderna covid vaccine my hand turned red and swollen bilaterally and from the 2nd knuckle down to the end of the fingers they were completely pale and the nails began turning blue. The change in color was a very defined straight line border. It was not painful and there was no numbness or tingling. I had not been outside or done anything involving a change of temperature. Along with my second dose I also experienced severe chills/shivering , nausea, sweating, fatigue, and body aches. These also happened with the first dose. The change in color to my hands lasted about 2 hours. There does not seem to be any lingering issues since then.

There is large, discolored swollen area under my left arm (the arm I got the vaccine in) and it is very very sore. I can?t put my arm all the way down because it is so swollen under there

On day 10 post vaccination, a red rash developed on my left arm where I had been vaccinated. My arm was extremely sore this time. The next day I woke up with a severe rash all over my body. It was symmetrical, both of my hands/ elbows/thighs/ankles/and feet were covered in raised red bumps. The rash was extremely itchy. It continued to get worse for the next couple of days. After consulting with a doctor, I took a steroid dose pack and used a topical steroid cream to stop the rash from continuing to get worse. It eventually went away about a week and a half later.

                                                Got the vaccine on Feb 17, 2021 at 9am. On Feb 18 at around 8:30-9 pm, left cheek started feeling uncomfortable and a bit swollen. The next morning, swelling was extreme and extremely painful to touch. It was difficult to eat from left side and to laugh and talk. Also, had chills and felt weak.  I scheduled an online appointment with Dr.  he mentioned the condition is called acute pericoronitis and he suggested that vaccine might have increased the immune response to any infection that might have happened underneath the left wisdom teeth which hasn&#39;t come out yet. [Note: Same response had happened when I got my MMR vaccine on Feb. 1, 2021]. He prescribed Amoxicillin 500mg for a week.  As of Feb 22. 11 pm, after taking Amoxicillin and ibuprofen, the swelling has bit reduced but the pain persists.

I had a headache and severe pain in my right side. 2:00 am on February 12,2021 I woke up around 3 am in unbelievable pain and swelling starting at the right side of my face, down into my armpit, through my collar bone, chest and back. I had been running a fever and could not keep anything down. The swelling and unimaginable pain led me to go to ER where they treated me for anaphylactic shock. I received intramuscular shot of epi, IV Benadryl, toridol, famitodine. I was sent home, but ended up coming back after about an hour because I had gone into SVT.

                                                I felt fine until 6 the following morning, 2/24. I woke up with a sore arm and arm pit. At 9:30 2/24, I started experiencing severe back pain. I talked to a physician at a clinic my mother works at and they told me to take 800mg ibuprofen and apply heat. By the evening, my back pain subsided. My arm pit however, was still having a lot of pain. I continued taking the ibuprofen to help pain management. I noticed some soreness in my throat as well. I now know that my lymph nodes were swelling a lot and causing the pain. The right arm pit was so swollen I had a lump in it. Today 2/28, the swelling has gone down but I am still experiencing a little pain. Nothing compared to where it was.

No appetite. Struggled to read and process things. Could not work. Sharp pains in lymph nodes at various times throughout the day. Chest felt very tight and arm hurt to the point I thought I might be having a heart attack. Had trouble sleeping due to lymph node pain. Ibuprofen did not help. The arm pain at injection site was annoying but I barely noticed it due to my other symptoms.

                                                About 5-10 minutes after receiving the dose, a headache instantly appeared and throughout the day became a severe migraine that lasted up to two days. I had itching and redness at the injection site about 30 minutes after. I woke up in the middle of the night to hardness and sore, aching pain at the injection site.  I did experience extreme exhaustion about an hour after injection and that lasted for about 24-36 hours.   A weird bump has also formed spontaneously on the inside of my arm, opposite of the injection site at the same time the hardness and sore, aching pain arrived. The bump is slightly raised and a pink oval has formed around it with what appears to be blue and purple bruising.  I have had this bump since Friday night and it just looks like it is becoming slowly, more bruised. However nothing is forming at the center of the red bump.   I am unsure if the bump is related to receiving the vaccine or not, but did appear at the same time as other side effects.

                                                I started having tingling of my left lower lip 3/7 that continued to increase to 3/10 and has remained the same since. The numbness/tingling feel is isolated to left lip and chin and slightly feeling occasionally of the left gums. Touching region makes the region feel icy cold. It feels as thought the lip and chin is enlarged and hypo-tone and cold. When a nurse examined lower lip and chin noticed no change in tone or temperature. Symmetrical facial expression.

                                                The adverse event began as a feeling that there was an air bubble stuck in my throat. It then manifested into feeling like there was swelling in my throat. Eventually, there was external swelling on the left side of my throat. This lasted for a couple weeks, and would happen off and on. I visited the Nurse Practitioner at my doctor&#39;s office, and she confirmed that there indeed was some minor swelling in the lymph node on the left side of my throat. She ordered an ultrasound for my head/neck, but because of the cost, I was unable to get the ultrasound. The swelling has since subsided. I made the correlation that the swelling was on the same side as both of my Moderna injections, so I figure the swelling is due to the COVID vaccine.

Lymph nodes stayed swollen after first dose, got worse after second dose, and have been swollen since.   Swollen lymph nodes in neck, hard to breathe, went to hospital, told it was just the vaccine and to wait it out. Lymph nodes in neck went down in swelling after 2-3 days.  Irregular menstrual cycle, started approximately 2 weeks after first dose. Have had a menstrual cycle for 5 days every 9-12 days since first dose.  Hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms (lost vision, couldn&#39;t form sentences) on 5 Feb 21. Discharged after CT scan and MRI came back fine.

D/c on steroid dose pack, beta blockers, cough suppressant. Follow up with cardio and pulm. Now seeing immunologist as well who started me on corticosteroid inhaler, monteleukast. Running more blood work soon. PCP gave albuterol inhaler, did round of antibiotics, orders to use incentive spirometer for breathing capacity. Waiting on pulmonology follow up and 30 day holter monitor, stress ecg, and other cardiac tests.

The bullseye - lasted about 7-10 days. About three days into I went to the  Urgent Care - they gave me a cream to put on it and Benadryl. The red bump was warm to the touch and it was painful. Those helped resolved the bulls eye bump within three days.

Today 3/26/21 she was very sore and tender in the neck area on the opposite side which is left side. She stated that she used theragun to massage the area and noticed in the mirror a golf size ball on her neck. Possibly a swollen lymph node. She reports this swelling is getting worse. Counseled patient to contact MD for evaluation and report symptoms to VSAFE.

                                                I received my vaccine in my right arm around 3:20 pm on 1/5/21. My right arm started getting sore later that evening. The following day, 1/6/21, my arm was very sore and the injection site was tender to touch. I felt feverish and had chills. I also had a headache and felt very fatigued. I took some Advil that morning. I evaluated my arm in the evening and noticed a large red rash streaking down my right arm from the injection site. It measured approximately 3.5 in X 1.5 in. The rash was red, raised, painful, and firmer than my surrounding skin. I took 500 mg of Tylenol before bed. The next morning, 1/7/21, the rash had grown larger. The border of the rash was marked and I took an antihistamine around 7:00 am. At 1:00 pm the rash had grown larger, now measuring approximately 4.25 in X 2.25 in. My lymph nodes in my right armpit were also beginning to get sore. I visited the nurse practitioner at my hospital?s employee health clinic around 1:40 pm and we agreed to monitor my signs and symptoms at that time. The following morning, 1/8/21, the rash was bigger, but my skin was softer and more of a pink color than red. My arm did not hurt as much, though my right armpit was slightly more sore. Today, 1/9/21, my symptoms are much better. I have only slight soreness in my right arm and armpit. My rash has nearly resolved, though it is slightly itchy where the rash was.

Localized numbness, swelling, redness, heat, soreness present. I drew a circle around the redness &amp; the welt. Within 12 hours, the welt had dissipated, but the redness had grown outside the outline. Swelling decreased, but site was firm, hot, red, and more sore.

I had nausea, chills, felt very lethargic and sore to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand at work, and had a pounding headache.  The site where I got the vaccine was also more tender and sore than usual after a vaccination.  I left work early around 3 pm, took 400 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and tried to get as much sleep as I could.  By 6 am on 1/13/21, all these symptoms had gone away, but now I&#39;ve noticed a very swollen lymph node just above my left clavicle.

                                                12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn&#39;t cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn&#39;t much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn&#39;t in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn&#39;t seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.

                                                At the time of injection, the site became swollen and tender, and was red, itchy, and warm to the touch. I knew this was a normal side effect so I was not worried.  They faded after a couple of days. However, a week after the injection, these side effects returned. My arm was not as tender but it is itchy, red, warm, and swollen (feels firm.) I doubt it is anything serious but I figured I should report it just in case.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

By about 2pm I had body aches and a small fever. The second day, I was headachy with a sore arm.   the third day, Sunday, my arm was no longer sore, but my armpit hurt to move. At first it felt like a bra poke, but it would not go away. Monday and Tuesday, the irritant was high, but not painful. I believe this to be from a swollen lymph node. It currently feels like someone left a marble under my armpit.

                                                I developed a raised hive approximately 1 inch that was red, itchy and warm on Saturday the 23rd (8 days after the vaccination).  The hive grew in size over the course of the day to about two inches. Applied hydrocortisone cream and took 2 Benadryl that evening. A bump could be felt under the skin that was large and about palm sized. My left armpit was tender (possibly enlarged lymph node?). No fever. The next day the lump under the skin was gone and the hive was less raised. Still remained red. Took Benadryl 50 mg each night up until today 1-27-21. The area has since became larger still (3 inches) and is red. However it is not itchy. Appears to get worse after showering with warm water and after awakening in the morning when my skin is warm. I started applying a cold compress today 1-27-21 which has reduced redness, the outer ring of the area is the most red.

A week later my arm swelled up with the size expanding to a little smaller than a clementine and a new dime size patch appeared. Had to visit urgent care twice where they advised me to ice, take benadryl, and prednisone. Consulted allergist who told me it looks like a delayed reaction

I took 50mg of Benadryl and the swelling and itching subsided within 30 minutes.  I have Juvaderm lip filler which in some individuals is known to cause swelling of the lips and face after the vaccine was received. I did not have this reaction after my first vaccine. I did not receive any filler 14 days before or after my first Moderna injection.  I have not received any filler injections in the past 6 months.

On March 14 the muscle stiffness had moved from the injection site to my left shoulder. The muscles felt tight and bruised. The following morning, March 15 @ 10:30 a.m, the same pain has spread to my upper chest, around the collar bone. The area around also appears to be swollen, most noticeable on the neck. This is all accompanied by headaches increasing in severity as well as extreme exhaustion.

The rash appeared when I woke  up at 8am, and by 11am my face was swollen and red. I did not have any breathing issues. My face swelling subsided within a few hours. The next day on Sunday 3/20/21, the rash on my left upper arm at the injection site has disappeared, but the hives and swelling of the toes have worsened.

Most symptoms appeared overnight (about 8-12 hours post injection on 3/24) and have continued throughout the day (3/25). The shortness of breath began about an hour after injection (3/24), and has continued through the next day (3/25). So far treatment has involved taking ibuprofen at 10:30pm (3/24).

The swelling extended up the arm and into the arm pit and side breast tissue as well as swollen lymph node. She saw her family doctor on 3.26.2021 and he referred her to an allergist, informed her to report an adverse reaction and not to take second dose of COVID vaccine.

                                                A patient presenting to hospital OB department received Moderna doses on 1/20/21 and 2/18/21.  She received them from health department at a clinic.  She self-quarantined from 3/15 to 3/31 due to approaching her delivery date.  She was in contact with 2 friends on 3/10 which both tested positive on the 22nd and 26th respectively.   She presented to OB initially on 4/1 for labor &amp; delivery.  She was found to be COVID positive at this time after being COVID tested - she had no prior symptons of COVID.   She had to have an unscheduled c-section after 24 hours in labor.  While laboring she did go into a critical blood pressure range.  She was treated appropriately with medication.  Patient did well postpartum and postop.  Lungs were clear and patient afebrile.  Patient discharged 4/4.    Patient returned to hospital on 4/6 for elevated blood pressure (was advised on previous discharge to monitor blood pressures at home and to report if elevated).  Her inpatient stay involved being treated for elevated blood pressure with magnesium sulfate, nifedipine, and labetalol.  She had swelling in lower extremities and has had a Doppler study which showed no DVT.  She was on a blood thinner enoxaparin though because of postop status and also COVID.  She went home on 4/10 advised to follow up with provider if any more issues were to arise.  She went home on enoxaparin 40mg subcutaneous for 10 days, nifedipine ER 60mg daily, and labetalol 400mg three times daily.  Blood pressure elevation probably related to course of L&amp;D case but reporting due to the fact that patient had received both doses of the COVID vaccine and had tested positive during the course of the L&amp;D.

Nausea began &lt; 5 min after vaccine; everything else began within 10 min of vaccination.   Was treated with epinephrine, water, and Benadryl. Most symptoms subsided within a minutes. Breathing ease returned to normal within 5-10(?) minutes.   Was only monitored for 30 min or so after epinephrine. No EMS called; was not advised to go to hospital.

She reports that she went to urgent care, and was advised to continue with Benadryl cream, icing, and ibuprofen, however yesterday the area &#34;doubled in size&#34; expanding beyond the previously marked area.  She denies any chills, fever, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath associated with the symptoms.  She cannot think of any specific aggravating factors or relieving factors at this time.  She has not experienced similar symptoms in the past.

                                                On April 15, I noticed a pain in my right armpit. It was an achey sore pain, but also a more sharp, prominent pain at certain times. So I think it was a swollen lymph node. But by April 18 and 19, it only hurts when I raise my arm.   And also on April 15, my right arm was little itchy at the injection site, but I didn?t think anything of it. But by April 17, my whole upper right arm was very itchy, red, and warm to the touch. This has continued for the past few days. It?s not all the time, but a few times throughout the day and it lasts for probably a half hour to an hour.

Maybe some mild left tongue swelling. Normal swallowing, normal breathing. No cough. No vomiting or diarrhea. No rash. She called an urgent care who recommended Benadryl, which helped minimize the tingling sensation and swelling over the next 2 days. Over the following week she had soreness at her left jaw joint near her ear and some left eye dryness. No facial droop. Normal blinking and smiling. No facial muscle weakness noticed. She was not sick when she received the vaccine. No new medications. Tolerates NSAIDs normally without reaction. No facial fillers. Never had anaphylaxis before to anything -- foods, medications, injectables, other vaccines. No known PEG allergy. Has not used Miralax before.

                                                So I got the vaccine Monday night after work. Tuesday and Wednesday I ran a super high fever, body aches, lymphnode swelling on that side. No big deal . Well Thursday morning I woke up with a rash on both of my legs and my legs swollen like tree trunks. It?s a petechial rash. I called the pharmacist told to take Benadryl and Zyrtec since Friday. So I went to the doctors last night since I still have this rash and it hasn?t gotten any better with Benadryl and Zyrtec.  I got blood work done today. And I have  to get an arterial and venous Doppler done on Wednesday next week. They are concerned I may have blood clots since my legs are so swollen with a petechial rash. They are also giving me steroid tapper.

                                                Very minimal pain after initial shot on 12/29/2020. Pain subsided and I was well for 6 days no reactions. On 1/3/2021 my armpit became very swollen and painful, on 1/4/2021 the Right arm where I received the injection became severely painful, dull throbbing ache from shoulder down to my fingers. On 1/5/2021 my Right arm was now swollen, hot to the touch and a small red circle was forming on my bicep and pain continued to worsen. Today 1/6/2021 I saw my primary care physician that confirmed there is swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit and swelling at the site. The redness of the spot increased in size from the size of a dime to now the size of a half dollar.

                                                Hours after shot I noticed a large red swollen lump. On 12/31/2020 I showed this to one of my providers and he told me to give him a call if it had not disappeared by 1/4/2021. The redness was slightly better on 1/4 but then became drastically worse on 1/5/2021. I had a low grade fever(100.7), spreading redness, pain, itching, and swelling of left arm, on 1/5/2021 and was told to go to urgent care. I went to urgent care on 1/6/2021 and was diagnosed with cellulitis. My injection site was measured and I was instructed to go to the hospital if after given first and second dose of antibiotic, symptoms did not improve. Redness began to decrease and I did not go to the hospital. As of today, 1/9/2021 my left arm is mildly red and swollen.

I required epinephrine and diphenhydramine. Approximately 3.5hrs following the first dose of epinephrine / diphenhydramine, I had a rebound reaction and new dysphagia and went to the emergency department where I required another dose of epinephrine, IV famotadine, IV diphenhydramine, IV dexamethasone, and IV odanestron to bring the symptoms under control.   No local reaction at the injection site. Angioedema, urticaria, and dysphagia were all solely focused to the head, face, and mouth.

                                                12/31 I had tingling in my throat and was observed in urgent care for two hours with no intervention. It went away by the time I went to bed that night. 1/8 I woke up with a sore arm, did not think much of it and went to work. It was sore all day and when I got home I undressed to take a shower and noticed that it was red, swollen and hot to the touch. I tried hot compresses as I suspected it was cellulitis and marked the borders. It had grown in size the nest morning (1/9) which is when I went back to urgent care and was prescribed 3 days of Keflex. The first dose reduced the swelling and pain in my arm, but by the end of the course of antibiotics it was still red 1/13 I went back to urgent care to be seen for the redness and tenderness. The NP suspected that it may be an immune reaction rather than cellulitis and gave me a single oral dose of decadron with instructions to follow up in 3-4 hours by sending in a picture, and if it did not get better to fill a longer prescription for Keflex. At this point I have taken the prescription to the pharmacy and am waiting until after work to pick it up and begin the script.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning her co-worker, a 28 year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced anaphylaxis reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                First dose of Moderna vaccine received on 1/11/21 Monday on my right arm. The following day 1/12/21 Tuesday I started having itchy rashes on my left ear, along with right arm soreness. The rash on my left ear gradually progressed and spread as days go by until 1/15/21 Friday. I woke up with swollen ears, hives on my face, neck, chest, and upper body. On Saturday morning 1/16/21, my symptoms worsen with more itchy red rashes. On top of the rashes, my lymph node on my left neck felt swollen and tender. Also, I had a weird sensation in my throat that was not going away like something was stuck. After a TeleVisit, I went to the ER that day and got medical treatment. I was given Benadryl, Pepcid, Dexamethasone and IV fluids. Then I was sent home with Cephalexin, Prednisone, Benadryl, and Epi Pen. Right now, I still have symptoms of rashes on my face, ears, and chest but they wax and wane. I can feel it itching beneath my skin even if they are not showing. With my ears, I can say that they are not swollen and are less red now. I have no other known exposure but the Moderna vaccine. I do not have any known allergy either but to bee stings.

                                                Anaphylactic Reaction; Significant angioedema; Severe allergic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse, who was also a 28-year old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced an anaphylactic reaction, a severe allergic reaction, and significant angioedema.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included Hashimoto&#39;s disease and thyroid disease. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20-2A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date, the patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction, significant angioedema and a severe allergic reaction. Treatment for the events included epinephrine, unspecified antihistamines and unspecified intravenous fluids.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old, female patient with medical history of autoimmune disorders including Hashimotos disease and thyroid disease, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction, angioedema and hypersensitivity reaction. The event occurred on an unspecified date after first dose mRNA-1273 ((Lot# 039K20-2A) administration. The subject&#39;s concomitant medication was not provided. The event was treated with epinephrine, iv fluids and anti-histamines. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On Friday 1/29/21 One week after receiving the vaccine my left arm became sore around the injection site. Throughout the day it became itchy and developed into a rash. Saturday 1/30/21 it was very swollen, hot to the touch, and one large welt like rash. I took prednisone for the next couple days and it slowly went away. By Monday 2/1/21 it was slightly visible but gone for the most part. Today 2/4/21 the rash come back around the injection site and is once again hot to the touch. There is no swelling but it is slightly itchy again.

                                                I received my shot at 6:53pm. I went to the waiting room and waited until my time was up, I was released from my observation station at 7:11pm. Staff did ask me how I was feeling I had no signs or symptoms upon being released. I left the facility feeling great had no issues at all. I went to pick up my dinner at 7:45pm drove home. When I arrived home my lips started to tingle, and my face was starting to swell up. I inspected the rest of my body for any rash called my mom and read over the fact sheet that was given to me at time of shot. As per the directions regarding the risk of an allergic reaction I called my primary care doctor because my face was beginning to swell, and my throat started to feel scratchy. My primary care doctor called me back and advise I go to the ER immediately to be monitored for an allergic reaction.  I arrived in a Hospital just before 9pm and checked in at the ER. The doctor saw me quickly.  By the time the doctor saw me at the ER my face was bright red I had developed a rash all over my chest and back and on the injection site, my lips were swollen and had mild throat swelling. She gave me a high dose of prednisone and 2 Benadryl&#39;s.  They continued to monitor me for a while until they felt better and discharged me with a epi pen and other meds.

Then after about 3 hours I was feeling super cold, I felt as if I could not get warm 8 was shivering for 2 hours. Then I could barely move because of my body aches, started getting a fever in the middle of the night. I was taking Tylenol and Advil all night to help with the fever and body aches. My lymph nodes in my inner thigh were so sore, it felt like someone had punched me there. I was basically in a fetal position for next 12 hours after coming home.

                                                Facial edema, oropharyngeal edema; Lip swelling; Throat itching; Tachycardia; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 28-year-old female, patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed lips swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 15 Jan 2021, approximately five minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 15 Jan 2021, five minutes after the vaccine was administered, at 11:15am, the patient complained of lip swelling and throat itching. A healthcare provider assessed the patient and vital signs included, pressure 132/103 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats per minute, and 100 percent oxygen saturation. At 11:22am, the patient had facial edema, oropharyngeal edema and attempted to clear her throat. Vital signs reported at that time included, blood pressure 143/106 mmHg, heart rate 121 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 99 percent. Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine 50mg and epinephrine by injection twice. Emergency services were called to transport the patient, however, the patient declined transport.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, lip swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of lips swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema. The events occurred within minutes after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

                                                I had arm soreness the day of the vaccine (2/11/21). The following day I noticed an erythematous round lesion that was very tender and when palpated felt like a lump. The pain went away 2-3 days after the vaccine and the erythema/lump went away on 2/21/21. On 2/19/21 my left internal arm felt sore. I thought I pulled a muscle perhaps. On 2/21/21 the arm pain was worse and didn&#39;t feel like typical soreness that would come from exercise or sleeping in the wrong position. It was painful when I pulled my arm close to my body, as if something were being compressed. I palpated in the armpit and found a large lump slightly smaller than a golf ball. It was extremely tender and sent me into a panic. Someone pointed out it was the same arm as my vaccination, so I looked it up and learned about this side effect. Today (2/22/21), the pain is gone and the lump is smaller (feel like a typical enlarged lymph node).

I am a fitness trainer and RDN, no weight issue, and very high muscle composition, lungs are in excellent health.   Around mid afternoon next day, several hours after teaching an exercise class, I developed a fever and flu like symptoms. That Saturday night, I developed extreme nausea, along with sleep in and out the entire night due to nausea and fever.   This continued until Monday afternoon, over 2 days later. Then the symptoms disappeared in the blink of an eye, indicated it was definitely vaccination related.

When still occuring on 3/02, I used a mirror to check the area and discovered a single, white, blister-looking lesion on my labia minora (right side). The lymph nodes under the arm on my left side (injection site) and in my right groin are still swollen and have been since 2/28.

All of my skin, back and spine hurt, in the way that your body is sensitive and extra painful when you have a fever but I checked and I haven&#39;t had a fever yet. All of the day on 02/28/2021 I experienced skin and back pain, headache, fatigue, and brain fog (difficulty focusing and making decisions) as well as swollen and tender lymph nodes in my left armpit and under the left side of my jaw. On 03/01/2021 I woke up and felt better in the morning, I went for a walk around 3 pm and around 4 pm when I got back and sat down I started to experience headache, severe nausea which turned into chest pain and chest tightness and I still have swollen lymph nodes.

I looked and there was a painful red swollen rash about two inches in diameter on my arm at the site of the injection. I monitored this for another day and over that time it increased in size to around 4 inches.  I contacted urgent care on Sunday 2/7/21 and was prescribed five days of antibiotics one dose every 12 hours. After After one dose of antibiotics my arm stopped hurting and the rash stopped growing.

                                                The patient did report swelling, induration and pain at the injection site. The patient  reports onset of headache, fever of 100.6, chills, body aches, night sweats, and malaise within a couple of hours of receiving dose 2 of her Covid 19 vaccine.  Due to how she felt, she went to bed soon after, and slept until the next morning. Upon waking up she noticed resolution of all her symptoms except for night sweats, and malaise.  She continued feeling hot and having night sweats but did not appreciate having a fever.  She also reports  the onset of significant facial swelling, periorbital swelling and swelling of her hands and feet, basically her entire body.  She also reports an onset of &#34;foul smelling&#34; diarrhea.  Her chronic eczematous areas which are her eyebrows, posterior neck, and scalp became more itchy and flaking and peeling.  She developed new areas of eczema and itching over her torso located at her mid axillary areas from her braline down to her waist area.  She also reports the onset of browniish red/ amber colored urine since receiving the vaccine. She continued to flake and peel over her eyebrows and cheeks in  continuously and in large amounts for the next 10 days.  She reports taking no antihistamines, or antipyretics.  She went to urgent care and was treated with 0.5% clobetasol cream which after 2 applications to her face caused a chemical, sun burn like reaction and more severe swelling over her cheeks and periorbital areas.  A photo shows that her left eye was so swollen it was half closed and the skin color was purplish. She returned to urgent care on March 11, 2021 and was prescribed a medrol dose pak.  She started it right away and her facial swelling improved.   On March 13 she came to see me.  with improvement in her swelling, peeling and flaking.   She was noted to have a fever of 101.6, then it was 100.6 after recheck and finally 99.6 before the end of her appointment.   It isn&#39;t clear whether her temp decreased because her medrol taken earlier that morning had kicked in or by removing her sweatshirt and being out of the sun allowed her to sweat and decrease her core body temperture to that level.She was asked to continue checking her temp which she reported as 99.8 on March 13, 100.6 on March 14, and 100.5 on March 15.  She has been instructed to check her temp everyday for the next 14 days.  Her urinedipstick showed 1&#43; bilirubin and ketones with trace blood and all other indicators were negative.  Patient was sent for stat bloodwork to evaluate for possible hemolysis.

These spots were itchy and painful and red for about a week and went away after about one week. It looked like I had chilblains on my toes, and the symptoms seemed similar.

States she went to urgent care for it on 03/18/2021, but they didn&#39;t do anything except tell her to take some Benadryl. When pt called, advised her to alternate between heat and ice for her arm to help with swelling and pain, and to take some Benadryl tonight when she goes to bed to see if that helps for tomorrow morning. Also advised her to call her PCP to see what their recommendation would be.

                                                Extremely sharp head pains and nausea started Tuesday (4 days after receiving the Vaccine) at 0245 AM. Thursday night around 0930 PM I noticed the swollen lymph nodes in the shower. After further investigation I noticed there were three almond sized swollen nodes (largest and most painful was in the left Clavicle and the other two were in the jugular area. Unfortunately after palpitations the nodes became extremely agitated and pain radiated from the neck down into the fingers in the left arm. On Friday (19 Mar I went to the clinic where I was tested for COVID and was negative) Over the weekend approximately 10-15 more Nodes became enlarged, followed by blurred vision in right eye and more intense headaches. 22 March I was sent to the ER for Lab work (testing white blood cell count) and an ultrasound of the lymph nodes .

                                                About 1 week after injection, my left shoulder around the injection site started becoming swollen, red, inflamed, and itchy. Within a few days, the swelling engulfed my entire shoulder and upper arm. The physical sensation was like an enormous, hot mosquito bite. No pain, unless I scratched it too much. I called my doctor for a telephone consultation, and he advised that I apply heat to it. I used a hot towel for the heat pad, and after a cumulative of 8-12 hours over the course of 2 days, the symptoms subsided, and my shoulder was completely back to normal.

Ache symptoms quickly dissipated after 48 hours, but a 2 inch diameter welt appeared, slightly raised and itching mildly like a mosquito bite. Welt is still present now, 5 days post-injection.

                                                I had patient report that she had localized swelling and lymphadenopathy.  I confirmed this on physical exam.  She had localized increased warmth over the left upper outer arm where the vaccine was given at the deltoid.  There was a raised area of skin in a serpiginous pattern circumferentially 3.5 across and 4.5cm in length.  It was blanching and not firm. She had 1 soft lymph node palpable at the left axilla, tender and 1.5cm in size.  She has had no other symptoms other than pain at the injection site for 2 immediately days after the injection was given.  I advised that she fill out the information for v-safe and asked that she report any further program to both v-safe and our office.

                                                Five days after vaccine dose I started with axillary swelling on left side. Then I started having progressive redness, swelling and itching at injection site. By day 8 (after vaccine) I had a 4x4? hard lump at injection site spreading from my deltoid to my elbow. Numbness and tingling in hand. Swollen, palpable lymph nodes in left armpit. Treated with Keflex and Zyrtec. Symptoms improved after 2 days on antibiotics and resolved after 7 days with the exception of tenderness and soreness which is ongoing. There was question if the vaccine was given too low and how much was in deltoid.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine on 01/06/2021. Normal pain at the injection site occured with little concern. Pain in armpit began 01/08/2021. I did not think anything of it, believing the pain to be from an ingrown hair caused by shaving or just something with the vaccine. I ignored it to spend time with family. On 01/12/2021 I noticed the pain had not subsided and deepened into the armpit causing pain to radiate from the area when lifting or moving heavy items.  I palpated the area and felt a pea sized lump. It moved freely. I could not locate it again. I continued to palpate into the top of my shoulder and discovered a large lump in the clavicle area. It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system. I also did research on side effects of the Moderna vaccine but observed most people to have lymph node symptoms for only 24-48 hours within three days of receiving the vaccine then they subside.  I made an appointment that same day, 01/12/2021, with Dr. at clinic to be examined. At first, Dr was dismissive of my symptoms. Dr did physically examine my areas of complaint and scheduled an ultrasound for 01/15/2021 at  Hospital. On 01/13/2021 I noticed the injection site began to ache again. On 01/14/2021 I awoke from a nap at 6pm. I began showering for work when I felt a burning, itchy sensation on my inner left bicep. I observed two red spots on my inner left bicep close to my armpit with a red rash below the two red spots. I palpated the red spots to find a large and slightly smaller lump under the skin corresponding with the red spots. The rash itches. As of 01/15/2021, the ultrasound had to be rescheduled by the hospital as their ultrasound technician cannot make it into work because of a blizzard. I now have two lumps in the clavicle area that alternate swelling and reducing in size. I&#39;ve been taking tylenol every four hours when I&#39;m awake to control the pain. The ones in my clavicle now cause tension in the left side of my neck. I&#39;ve also applied warm compresses on the affected sites. It helps lessen the swelling for a bit but does come back.

The very next day my face was slightly swollen in areas where I?ve had fillers in my lips and around my lips. Three days after the vaccination I woke up with my face completely swollen one eye was swollen shut and my upper lip was extremely heave and yet icing my face the swelling went down a lot about two weeks after the vaccination I started slowly losing taste but ONLY with salty foods.

After 20 minutes, initial round of itchiness subsided. For the next 48 hours the injection site was warm, red, swollen (size of half-dollar) with intermittent periods of itchiness. Itchiness is continuing to come and go now (almost 72 hours post injection) but much milder.

                                                Morning after administration I had the typical extremely sore arm from injection.  Around noon that Wednesday (13th), I started to experience lower back muscle aches. As the day progressed my whole back was achy and began to have the chills. I felt as if I had &#34;been hit by a car,&#34; extreme aches. Through the night I had chills and drenched in sweat all night. I only took ibuprofen and rested. I never had a fever when I took my temperature. Thursday (14th) I woke up with minor back aches and the chills had resided. Just very tired from my body working in over drive. Again, I only took ibuprofen and began to feel better. I thought I was done with reactions.  Friday (15th) I woke up feeling better, no more aches or chills. However, I had extreme pain in my left arm pit, same arm of injection. My armpit was swollen and uncomfortable and seemed to be a swollen lymph node. I had no other symptoms this day, felt totally fine, just had this swollen lymph node. Again, took ibuprofen.  Saturday (16th) I was back to feeling like myself.   All the while I had a headache, however I experience headaches/migraines very often, so I did not include this as a direct reaction.

                                                On day 5 after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I woke up in the morning to feeling pain on my left armpit where the lymph nodes are located. The pain feels tender and constant. It helps to take tylenol to decrease the pain.   My left armpit feels tender and sore. It looks a bit swollen. I know I slept on my left arm, so it may be sore from that, but it does not feel like arm strain. It is just on my armpit area I feel the pain and discomfort. I do not feel pain on my injection site.  It is now day two that I am experiencing this pain. I do not feel pain on my right arm or armpit.

When I got to work, I looked at my arm and it was very swollen, red, warm, firm, and itchy. By Sunday 1/17, I started to see progress with the swelling, warmth and redness.  It is still mildly itchy. Please note, when I got the vaccine on 1/06/21, I had the normal side effects of arm soreness, fatigue, mild muscle aches and a mild headache; all of these symptoms were gone by Friday 1/08/21. I saw [vaccine administrator] and she instructed me to use ice and hydrocortisone cream.  I iced it for 4 days and there was no change until day 4 (Sunday). I also used Aleve during this time as well. I saw my PCP on Monday 1/18 and she told me to continue the current treatment of ice and Alieve and to update her on Wednesday 1/20.&#34;

I did speak to a Dr. and they suggested I take Benadryl, put ice and outline it to see if it was growing.  It took about two days to go away.

                                                after 24 hrs from receiving the second Covid vaccine, I started to feel the typical body aches and low grade fever. However, that evening my lips swelled and my hands and feel swelled along with being itchy on the hands and feet. I took a zyrtec and was better by morning. I did have intense shaking throughout the night and was freezing. I did take 2 doses of ibuprofen during the day on the 21st.

I had to take a Benadryl for the allergic reaction.  but the reason why my arm got swollen was because the person who gave me the injection put the vaccine really close to my shoulder so most probably he poke a vein or nerve and injected the medication directly in my vein because in just seconds of getting the vaccine that started happening.  and the next day i also got normal side effects pain to my arm, bodyaches, fever, nausea, headache but i took tylenol for the fever and muscle and body aches and severe cold and flu medication

Also no appetite since the vaccine combined with dizzy spells. I?ve been to the ER twice thought it was anxiety but it?s becoming to consistent for anxiety.  Feel like my blood pressure is going up and down.  ER assumed it was anxiety because that?s what I thought it was at first. Normal doctor did virtual visit today and said it all seems to possibly be a reaction to the shot.

                                                Within 2 hours of the shot, I got a headache and started feeling deathly ill.  I felt as if I was going to vomit and nothing I did helped.  My arm got a little red and sore a few hours after the injection.  Over the next few days my arm continued to get even more red &amp; irritated as well as swelling some.  I have photographs of each phase of the irritation; if this is needed, I will gladly send them in to you all.  I had to stay out of work that whole weekend (2/26, 2/27, &amp; 2/28) due to not being able to get out of bed.  I stayed in bed for the majority of the weekend sleeping and was not up moving around more than 8 hours the whole weekend.  Since I was still sick and having issues after so many days, the Medical Control Unit at my job (run by our Fire &amp; Rescue Department) made me get tested on 3/1/21 to make sure it was not COVID.   Later that afternoon, the test came back as negative.  I still was feeling nauseated and fatigued even weeks after the shot.  I have stayed nauseated since then and have also been very tired still.

                                                12/31 8:30am noticed maculopapular erythematous rash mostly on torso (few lesions on extremities), itchy scalp, and mild edema/erythema at RT corner of bottom lip. Also had mild pain on ball of RT foot, thought I had stepped on something. 1:30pm woke up with severe edema of bottom lip, rash also on scalp next to ears 3pm seen at urgent care, received and filled prednisone prescription  4pm lip edema started improving, so did not end up taking the prednisone 8pm lip edema gone, erythema and mild edema to DIP joint and tips of fingers, all fingers of LT hand and RT pinky. All hand joints and wrists sore. Soreness to toes and heels while walking but not at rest. Applied ice to fingers, then turned up heat. 1/1 3-4am finger edema/erythema totally resolved 8am foot pain starts resolving 5pm still with mild wrist pain, mild foot pain. Rash evolving -- most lesions improved but some have coalesced, new lesions on neck  Never any fever, checked x2, Tmax 99.0F. Did not end up taking any medications since my symptoms seemed to be resolving. Only other possible recent exposures were a new lotion tried 12/27 (but only applied to face, was careful to keep it away from my lips, and I did not have any rash on my face except the swollen lip) and a new dress that I did not pre-wash (but I had few lesions on my arms which would have also been exposed).

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

The lymph nodes in my left arm pit are also sore. It has now been 13 days since I received the vaccine (6 days since I noticed the enlarged lymph nodes) and the lymph nodes are still enlarged. I don&#39;t think they have gotten any bigger or smaller, but they are not quite as tender.

Six days after vaccine was given, I experienced an enlarged lymph node on the left side base of my neck. The lymph node was about the size of a dime, firm, and tender to the touch. Minimal armpit pain was experienced (similar to an ingrown hair), except there wasn&#39;t an ingrown hair. On the 7th day, about  15 hours after noticing the enlarged lymph node, swelling and tenderness has reduced, but has not disappeared completely.

Here, she is slightly tachycardic, but her oxygen level is good, her lungs are clear.  She has no urticaria, she has no stridor or wheezing.  She does not wish to receive epinephrine because she has had such bad effects from it in the past, and is agreeable to Solu-Medrol and Benadryl.  She took Pepcid prior to having her injection.  Her friend who is with her recommends that she has a history of severe events like this in the past, and she usually does better after breathing treatment.  However, patient states that she often ends up on BIPAP&#34; PER ED MD NOTE

                                                received the Moderna vaccine on 1/4/2021 around 1400 in my Left shoulder . On 1/7 I noticed that my left armpit was slightly swollen. The swelling worsened over the weekend, 1/8-10, and on the evening of 1/10 I noticed that the injection site location had a round, asymmetrical, red blotch. On 1/11, it had grown and spread down my arm. By 1/12, it had spread down to my inner arm, was warm to touch and painful. I tried to get in touch with occupational health to report this reaction and seek medical advice, but did not hear back, so I went to my PCP. They diagnosed cellulitis and put me on a 7 day course of Keflex.

(4 days after receiving vaccine). First time this has ever happened to me. Slight tender. Definitely noticeable and easily palpable. No other illness prior to vaccine. I have had to take OTC Tylenol for discomfort. I have scheduled an appt. with my PCP to discuss this on Thurs 2/4/2021.

                                                Starting four hours after the vaccination I became fatigued and this lasted through the next day. I started getting headaches the day after the vaccine and took ibuprofen once to treat those. On 1/27, I developed a swollen, red lump about 2-3 inches in diameter around the injection site. My whole right arm was swollen and tingly and the red lump was itchy, uncomfortable to touch, and hot. On 1/27, I also got severe headaches and muscle pain in my neck, right shoulder, and back. I visited a nurse practitioner who thought this to be an skin infection developed from the introduction of bacteria in some way during the vaccine, and she prescribed cephalexin to treat it. After two days of taking the antibiotic, the redness and swelling subsided, along with the other symptoms. Now I am reading that other had similar delayed hypersensitivities in response to this vaccine and believe this was actually a reaction to the vaccine and not an infection.

Dr on Thursday or Friday he Gave me steroid cream - triamcinolone and he told me to take Benadryl and Tylenol. It lasted about five days after my doctor visit.

I went in to see my primary care doctor on the same day. She referred me to get an ultrasound done (1/21/2021) which confirmed it was 3 swollen supraclavicular lymphnodes, ranging up to roughly 2 cm. The swelling and pain went away in a week however the swollen lymphnodes did not. I got my second injection on 2/11/2021, which did not trigger any changes in the size or swelling of the lymphnodes. It has now been almost 3 weeks since my second dose and the size of the swollen lymphnodes remains unchanged. I have had one follow-up visit with my doctor who advised we check in in 2 weeks if the lymphnodes remain changed.

                                                After going to bed, I began to feel tingling in my face. Over the course of an hour the swelling in my right side of my face became so pronounced that my gums were hard affecting the shape of my lips. I got out of bed and brushed my teeth, flossed, mouthwashed and salt water rinsed wondering if I&#39;d maybe gotten something stuck in my teeth and went back to bed. By 1 am I was awoken by feeling like my teeth were going to fall out of my head it kept me up most of the night. I could feel my heart beating in my teeth. By morning, I had a small tear in my gums and the fluid had drained from the gums but there was an excess of tissue kind of hanging off my gums. I had typical mild fever and fatigue on Saturday, I took one dose of motrin. By Sunday the swelling was gone and my mouth felt better but I do continue to have some numbness on my upper right lip.

                                                24 hrs after injection, swelling, itchy, pain, body aches - took Benadryl, hot compress and ibuprofen. The injection site redness never went away, swelling came and went but 3/6 into 3/7 the swelling got worse. I called the on call nurse (2:30pm) where I got the vaccine and they advised me to be seen if it does not get any better. 2 hours later the swelling progressed to my left elbow. It was hot to touch, painful, burning sensation.   3/8 ER Dr gave me an oral steriod at the hospital, I was prescribed Keflex, Pepcid, Kenalog.  Diagnoses: adverse effect of vaccine, initial encounter &amp; cellulitis to left upper extremity

                                                No immediate adverse effects. About 2 hours after I received the vaccine, I began to experience noticeable pain/tenderness in my left bicep that slowly progressed throughout the evening. The next morning I was experiencing significant lethargy, body aches, headache, and extreme systemic skin sensitivity - even brushing my hair was painful. Those symptoms mostly resolved after 24 hours, and my arm is still slightly swollen and painful, but I&#39;ve now developed a localized rash around the injection site.

                                                I received my first shot on 1/29. I had some severe arm pain and fatigue for the first two days but nothing out of the ordinary. In the early morning on 2/4, 7 days after my shot, I started getting chills, had a splitting headache and my left underarm was too sensitive to move. I went to bed, woke up the next morning, the chills were gone but the headache snd swollen lymph nodes remained. My headache subsided after a day, my swollen left arm lymph nodes  stuck around for 2-3 days. By 2/6, I developed the red ring on my arm that I had read to be Covid arm which seemed rare but happening per the news.  By 2/7-2/8 I was able to comfortably move my arm again and my rash subsided.   I received my second shot on 2/26 and happy to report I had minor arm pain again and fatigue but no other adverse reactions at this time. It?s now been 13 days.

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

                                                After 1st vaccination on 02/14/2021 developed fever of 100.0-102.3 degrees with associated muscle aches and fatigue lasting 24hrs. Was somewhat concerned with how severe symptoms were after 1st vaccination. Within 24hrs of 2nd vaccination developed 100.6 - 103.0 degree fever that lasted throughout the day and did not decrease after multiple administrations of Tylenol and Ibuprofen. Associated nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, joint pain and fatigue during this time. After 48hrs from 2nd dose noticed moderately enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of neck and left axillary region and left breast that are still ongoing to date. Besides the enlarged lymph nodes and fatigue all other symptoms have resolved. Concerned about duration and sight of enlarged lymph nodes as there is a family hx of breast cancer.

This morning patient went to have her first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination.  She was accidentally given and 3 mL instead of 0.5 mL of this vaccine.  She was monitored following administration of this vaccine.  Patient apparently did well and she went home.  Then around 1030 she started having diffuse body itching and felt that her throat was tight.

                                                The day immediately following administration of my first dose, my arm was tender at the injection site and my body was fatigued. This went away the second day after administration.  There were no other symptoms or side effects after the second day post administration until the following event on March 14th. On March 11th, I flew out of state, direct flight. On March 13th, I flew from that state, to another, direct flight. On the morning of March 14th, I woke up with an approximately 5&#34; diameter, raised red circle around the injection site and the lymph nodes on the left side of my body  were extremely large and swollen. The lymph nodes under my left arm pit were specifically extremely swollen. Anytime my left arm brushed against my lymphnodes in my armpit, it was extremely painful. This lasted until March 18th. My lymphnodes are still slightly swollen, but not as noticeable as before. The rash on my arm went away around the same time, forming a ring like appearance temporarily.

Patient then woke up the next day (03/13/2021) and noticed that all of her fingers were more swollen than normal. Throughout the day, the patient reports that her finger swelling resolved and did have some facial swelling.  4 days later on 03/17/2021 the patient developed 3 pustules on her left shoulder at the injection site and another on her right scapula. The following day (03/18/2021), the patient began to have swelling around her eyes and lips. She saw her PCP that same day and was prescribed prednisone, Zyrtec, and hydroxyzine; however, the patient continued to develop mild pustules throughout her body.  She presented to the ED on 3/19/2021 for evaluation. The patient was given 10 mg of dexamethasone and recommended to switch to benadryl.  After discharge from ED, patient reports that her rash has continued to worsen as it is spreading diffusely all throughout her body. Patient specifically states that her rash spread from her left arm into her chest, then to her back, groin, face, and lower extremities. On 03/21/2021, patient reports that her pustules advanced into target lesions around her face along with developing some lesions in her mouth, as well. Patient also notes that her skin &#34;burns&#34; whenever she itches it. Patient then went in to be evaluated by a dermatologist and was sent to the ED for admission to the hospital.     Patient currently hospitalized and undergoing work-up/treatment.  Current treatment includes oral anti-histamine, analgesics, topical steroid, and IV fluids.

                                                The following morning after I received my 2nd Moderna vaccine, I was awoken by my symptoms around 3:30am. My arm became so swollen and painful, I could not extend my arm at all.  I could only keep it bent and close to my body. I could not use my left arm at all for 2-3 days after the vaccine. The swelling got so bad that my entire arm felt numb and tingley and throbbed uncontrollably whenever I tried to move it.  I took ibuprofen and tylenol, every 6-7 hours as well as used warm and cold compresses, and that did nothing to help the swelling. The pain medications only took a slight edge off of the pain. I experienced these symptoms along with fever, body aches, muscle pain, joint pain, muscle spasms in my arm and leg muscles,  headache, and my nose was very runny after waking up in the morning.  All of those symptoms lasted for several days as well.  The numbness and pain lasted for a full week after the vaccine. It is now March 26th and my arm is still a bit sore at the vaccine site.  On Wednesday, March 24th, the vaccine site starting throbbing again and I did experience a low grade fever of 99.7 throughout the day. I felt very fatigued throughout the week as well.

This spontaneous case was reported by a pharmacist and describes the occurrence of HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) and ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) in a 30-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 031A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (Medical history was not provided).    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 3 milliliter. In March 2021, the patient experienced SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin). On 17-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml). On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 17-Mar-2021 to 18-Mar-2021 due to ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION. In March 2021, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) had resolved. On 17-Mar-2021, ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml) had resolved. At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinations), SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient did not have any psychological history; this was the first time she experienced hallucinations.  Treatment for the severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis included intravenous steroids and hydrocortisone.  Treatment for hallucinations included droperidol and lorazepam.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event (anaphylactic reaction), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding the events (Hallucination, anaphylactic reaction, sleep terror, fear of death, delusion, and formication) has been provided at this time. This report refers to a case of (accidental overdose) for mRNA-1273, lot # 031A21A. Further information has been requested.

                                                I am 16 days post first Moderna injection and I currently still have swollen and tender lymph nodes under my right arm pit, around the back of my right upper arm and into my upper back.   The day after the vaccine I felt feverish, had severe fatigue, muscle aches and headache.  Those symptoms lasted approx 10-12 hours and I have no longer experienced them.  I noticed the pain in my arm pit and swelling the following day and it has continued.

Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

Was kept at the hospital to be watched for approximately 45 minutes.  12 hours later night sweats, headache, site reaction cleared up.  8 days later (1/14/21) site became red, hot, and very inflamed. I had a similar reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine in September so I immediately contacted my allergist. I immediately took prednisone as instructed by my doctor and went in for an appointment. About 4 hours after the new site reaction, joint pain and malaise began. I&#39;m continuing on a steroid regimen for treatment.   Today 1/16/21 I am still having joint pain and swelling. Site on my arm is mostly cleared up.

                                                I had a racing pulse, my throat was really itchy and tighter than normal ,  my lips were numb, my tongue was tingling.  This happened during the observation period and then I was sent to the ED.  About a week later, on the left arm, looked like I had hives, it was swollen and warm to the touch, pain went down into my wrist. I went to Urgent Care.

Of particular note, she reported prior dermal filler injections to the lips (Juvederm) approximately 1 year prior to vaccination (I am aware of other case reports and felt this was necessary to report an additional event).  The angioedema lasted approximately 3-4 days and was also accompanied by expected flu-like symptoms, fatigue, fever, and back aches.  There was NO immediate IgE mediated reaction.

                                                I received the vaccine on January 8th, with no adverse events beside arm pain which subsided after 2 days. On January 16th, I noticed that my arm began to ache again. Then on January 17th, I developed redness, warmth, and swelling, which has continued to expand down my arm. I reported this to employee health, who recommended I report to this site, was not allowing me to self report.

On 1/20/2021 I noticed the site of injection is red, swollen, and a little hard, however, it is not painful at all.  The redness, swelling, and hardness didn&#39;t appear until the 20th of Jan, it was fine before then. I have been getting major headaches every day since I got the vaccine.

Pharmacist attended to her, and after some questioning she exhibited signs of Anaphylaxis. At 1:56 an Epipen 0.3 mg/0.3 ml dose was administered and 911 called. At 2:00 we checked her BP and it was 132/78 and pulse 95. A few minutes later, before a second check of BP was done, the EMT took over.

I put an ointment and took Allegra 24 hour to treat reaction. On January 22, 2021 I woke up with two more spots on my arm so I went to go see my doctor and I was given a shot at the clinic and also prescribed an ointment and oral medication (I do not have them with me at this time). On the evening of January 22 , my arm (near the shoulder area) swelled and got red. It is a hot and burning sensation on the area of reaction with redness and swelling. At this time, most of the swelling and redness went down,  but I am still dealing a mild burning sensation and mild swelling. I will still taking the 24 hour Allegra along with the oral medication and ointment I was prescribed yesterday.

                                                I got the vaccine on Jan 5th. Felt fine that night but the next morning I had an inflammatory response. Every area of my body that I&#39;ve injured as an adult was swollen and sore. My jaw where I had my wisdom teeth removed last year, my knee that I had surgery on about 2 years ago, any part that had previously had been injured. That night I was tired but felt back to normal on the 7th. On the 13th I went to the gym and did upper body and that night I started to have a reaction at the injection site. On the 14th my arm had swelled significantly and turned bright red, I went to our health clinic and was put on steroids to calm things down. I think exercising my upper body a week after the shot made me have that reaction, like exercising the muscle made the vaccine secrete faster or something.

                                                Currently pregnant when I received the first dose of the Moderna Vaccine on 1/22/21. At the time I was 6 weeks pregnant. My estimated dat of delivery is September 15, 2021.   The evening of 1/22/21 I experienced mild chills and tenderness around the injection area. 1/29/21, 7:30pm I experienced itchiness around the injection site. 1/30/31, 8:00am I checked my left shoulder and noticed that it was swollen and red in a 3x4 inch size around the injection area. As the day progressed I experienced more red patches that were itchy pop up at different areas of my body, including on my hands and wrists, on my butt and thighs, and on my knees and feet. I took a benadrly 25mg at around 8pm that evening. 1/31/21, 7:00am I woke up with facial swelling and numbness of both my upper and lower lip. I also felt itchy on my left hip. I went to the urgent care and I was advised to continue taking Benadryl as needed. Around 1pm I noticed more itchy spots had popped up near the injection site and on my butt. I took a benadryl around 2pm. My bottom and upper lip are still mildly swollen, however the swelling and numbness has decreased (3:25pm).

Exactly one week after being vaccinated (1/27/21, ~6:30 PM), my arm began to swell up again at the vaccination site and was itchy, warm, and red. The maximum diameter of the swelling was ~12cm. My axillary lymph nodes were also swollen and painful. This lasted for ~8 days with symptoms improving as time went on.

                                                I had a huge red spot start to form a couple days after the shot. The delayed reaction was weird. It itched a little but it wasn?t particularly painful. My arm felt a little swollen &amp; tender but I kept second guessing that because I was just so surprised. I didnt put anything on it and it didn?t prevent me from doing any daily activities so I didn?t contact my PCP about it. Eventually it wasn?t there or faded and it?s been 2 weeks since my first dose as of today (2/8/21).

                                                Week after the vaccine, my left arm became painful. It got progressively more swollen throughout the day. It wasn&#39;t red that first day I noticed it but the next day it was a big splotch of bright red about the size of my hand - right on the injection site and underneath it. Hot to touch, painful and swollen. All day Tuesday, Wednesday. I had a Dr&#39;s appt on Wednesday. It eased off on Thursday and Friday and it was gone by Saturday. Dr prescribed antibiotics for it and also a creme - Triamcinolone. I still have the photos I took if that would help to see them. Doctor diagnosed as Cellulitis Dermatitis. I did get the same the same reaction the day after (Jan 27) my second dose of vaccine (Jan. 26).

                                                I had shot on 29th - I had sore arm for two days after that. Morning of 6th, I woke up with really sore arm - worse than before and a couple of red dots that looked like hives and throughout the day my arm became more sore, redness increased and there was swelling. Next morning, the redness had taken over the whole upper arm and it was more swollen (the whole upper arm and it was painful). It worsened through the day. I was advised to see someone in walk-in at the hospital later that day - diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed cephalexin - an antibiotic. I took it right away. A few minutes after (at about the same time as I took the antibiotic) that I got a few hives and got more as the night went on. I woke up later that day after I had taken an antibiotic. I had chills, body aches, burning in my joints and I broke out in hives. The next day the hives were gone - still had the redness, swelling and body aches, chills. The next day, everything except the redness, swelling and pain were gone. By the 11th and 12th - swelling reduced and the redness went away soon after that. I completed my dose of antibiotic - I was told it was probably not cellulitis but more likely a reaction from vaccine.

                                                Pt received Moderna vaccine at community event. Pt reported an allergy and monitored for 30 minutes post administration. Approximately 15 minutes post administration, the patient reported tingling around her lips. She agreed to take Benadryl 25mg PO. The patient reported feeling well upon leaving the site. I contacted the patient approx. 1 hour later to check in. She replied via email &#34;I am not feeling well but I am doing okay. I have a follow up appointment with my doctor this afternoon.&#34; I followed up again on Monday March 1st, and she replied, &#34;I saw my doctor late afternoon Friday. When I got home my face was puffy and my throat felt weird so she sent over a prescription for prednisone. Saturday I developed hives. I ended up seeing three doctors in total over the weekend, all said due to my reaction I should not be getting a second dose. I appreciate you emailing to check in. I&#39;m happy that now all of my symptoms have cleared and I am feeling much better. &#34; After this email the follow up concluded.

For 2 days had migraine, low grade fever,  severe body aches, extreme fatigue.  Couldn&#39;t stand longer than  3-5 mins.  Right arm was red, swollen and very sore for 3 days. The following week I had fatigue and flu like symptoms.  8 days after vaccine (Feb 21)  the following Sunday i was feeling worse like I had the flu and broke out with a localized rash on the right side of my neck.  The rash worsened and got more painful as the week went on and became pustules filled with clear fluid.  Sunday (Feb 28) I broke out with a rash all over my body. They were clear fluid filled pustules.  Monday ( March 1) I went to my primary care physician who stated i for sure had shingles but did not know what the secondary rash was from since it was all over my body and not just 1 side as with shingles.  The next day (Tues March 2) I went ad saw a dermatologist who  confirmed shingles and a secondary rare virus called disseminated zoster.  He was shocked saying he had only seen ever 2 other patients with this and they were immuno-compromised  and were on immunosupressants. It was been nearly a week since this diagnosis and I am still having nerve pain all over my body and extreme fatigue. The pustules are drying up.

                                                A minute after the shot I got a really bad headache, similar to a migraine. It lasted for the full 15 minutes of my waiting time but had started to let up after that. I was given an ice water to hold to my head and drink.  The next day my arm was very swollen and sore. It hurt to touch. The swelling was still present the day after that but it had started to go down and not hurt as much when pressure was applied.  A week after the vaccine to the day my arm swelled again even more than before. There is pain if I put pressure on it but mostly it is very hard and a bit itchy. The rash is about 6 inches in length and about 7 across. When I looked up symptoms, this seemed to perfectly match the description of &#34;COVID arm&#34;.

I started to feel weak as time went by and eventually by 10:00pm it became severe. I had developed a lump on shoulder and a rash formed. My left side of my body was numb and on Sunday March 14, 2021 I was dizzy and could barely move. It is not Monday March 15, 2021 and the lump grew larger and is now on my neck. My left arm hurts but some of my strength returned.

                                                First pregnancy.  Singleton. Diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 12 weeks. At the time of the vaccine, I was 26 weeks 4 days (first does, 4 weeks prior). Delivering at approximatly 39 weeks due to gestational diabetes diagnosis.  The evening (around 7/8pm) of the day I got my vaccine I started to feel generally unwell. Woke up at 1 am shivering uncontrollably. Took 1000mg extra strength Tylenol (No fever yet). Woke up around 4 am sweating. Slept for a little longer. Took 1000mg extra strength Tylenol as directed through the rest of the day. I had a fever of 100 degrees around 10 am and called the nurse line for my delivery hospital, concerned about my fever. Talked to Dr.  and she said to keep taking Tylenol, a lukewarm bath, lots of fluids and continue to monitor fever. If gets to 102, then would be of concern. Around noon I was feeling a little better, took a nap, and woke up with 101 fever so I took a bath and that helped my temp drop. Between the bath and about 7pm I felt better again. Before bed, my temp jumped up again to 100 but woke up in the morning with no fever. Felt good most of the day Sunday until later afternoon where I had stomach/intestinal pain and just overall fatigue. Rested the rest of the night. Felt normal on Monday. From the date of vaccination- Tuesday my arm was sore and had a little bit of swelling.

                                                The first shot, approximately 10 days after the shot, my arm became itchy with small bumps. As the day went on it became really itchy. My left arm had a raised, hard, red area that was hot to the touch. It went away about 5 days later. I treated with oral Benadryl and hydrocortisone cream to help with itching.   The redness and itching began on the second day after receiving the second shot. It is now day 4 and my arm is measuring about 1? more in circumference then the arm that did not receive the shot. It is swollen, red and hot to the touch. It does not feel as itchy this time but it reminds me of having a bad sunburn. It is very sensitive.

                                                Day 1-3 had painful and sore arm near injection site. (It felt like the vaccine settled in my arm about an inch below the injection site. It seemed slightly inflamed and was sore to the touch).  Bruise developed at injection site (possibly due to needle bursting blood vessel) which is still present 7 days after vaccination was administered.  One week after vaccination a rash developed on my left arm in the same area that was painful immediately after the injection of the Moderna vaccine. Rash is red, firm, slightly inflamed/raised, warm to the touch, and itches.  I have been treating with topical ointments (benadryl cream, cortisone cream) and ice packs applied to the area.  Other symptoms that manifested the same day the rash began: gas, lose stool, fatigue, body aches, swollen lymph nodes in throat.

                                                Around 10 am (2hrs post vaccination) I noticed some hives on my hands and dizziness. I also developed a mouth sore that later went away around 5pm. I drank 1.5 L of water and put some topical Benadryl cream on the hives, these symptoms resolved. At 8pm I began to get a temperature (temp max 101.2 around 11:17pm), a very sore swollen arm, massive headache, and myalgia/arthralgia in knees bilaterally. On 1/5 temperature has subsided to low grade (99.2F) but I still don?t feel well and have no sense of smell with a runny nose.

Self-examination revealed tender lymphadenopathy with size between 1-2cm. Mild itching around the injection site was noted the evening of 12/30/20. A small, irregularly shaped erythematous rash was noted around the injection site the morning of 12/31/20 - over about 24 hours this darkened to be tan/brown as compared to surrounding skin. There was gradual resolution of pain/tenderness, lymphadenopathy, and rash by approximately 1/1/21.

At got better and was normal by day 3.  Today, 7 days from day of injection, I woke up with my left arm (injection side) sore and inflamed, arm was warm to touch and hurt when I pushed. There&#39;s a mass of dense/sore area, sort of feels like a dense lump.  Area around on skin is itchy - has been this way all day. Tonight the swollenness and itchiness is traveling into left armpit as well.

I was told that my lips and cheeks were swollen and that my eyes were red. I was first given benadryl (25 mg) and prednisone (20 mg). I was later given epinephrine ( 0.3 mg/0.3mL injection). I was then taken to the emergency room where they prescribed the above medications to be taken for 3 days (minus the epinephrine).

                                                45 minutes after dose I got hot flashes and itchy across chest and arm. Upon inspection arm was swollen. Area roughly 2 inches from injection sir was the size of a quarter. It was hot, red and itchy with a small rash above. Two hours later it increased in redness but itching went down. Still hot and red. The next morning small rash still present with hot, red ?lump?. Extremely tender to the touch. Progressively increased in size to the size of a half dollar. Continued to increase in size over the next 72 hours. 6 days later site is back to the size of a half dollar, red and itchy tender site. Has since reduced from a ?lump? to more flat. Took 599mg Tylenol 1/5/2021 and again 1/6/2021. Unable to take Benadryl due to sensitivity (over sedation) with household and family responsibilities. Sore throat also present for first 72 hours but went away.

Left arm stop hurting after 1 day but the lump is still there.  On 1/12/21,  I start noticing my underarm starting to hurt.  I thought I pulled a muscle or maybe a swollen lymph node. Did a self examination no swollen lymph so I thought it was a pull muscle. Been taking Advil twice a day but now it is the 1/14/21 underarm still hurt and the lump on the left arm is still there and slightly swollen now. Still taking Advil twice a day due to left underarm pain.

The swelling started as a golf ball and swelled to the size of a softball and was hot. Went to the doctor Wednesday at 11 and was prescribed methylprednisolone tablet pack. Swelling is down and feeling much cooler.

On 1/3/2021 it was discovered that had &#34;massive lymph node enlargement&#34; in my right axillary and breast region. At 32 years old, everyone took this very seriously and I started a FULL work up after being told &#34;this is acting like either breast cancer or lymphoma&#34;.

                                                She had a history of hives and fainting  when she received the pertussis vaccine.  This was her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and she had no known allergy to components of the COVID-19 vaccine.  She said she had spoken with her doctor prior to her appointment.  Staff at the vaccination facility set up a precaution in case she fainted including 1:1 observation immediately following injection.  She had no fainting, and proceeded to the post vaccination area after about 15 minutes, when she said she felt fine.  At about 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she reported a rash across her chest, visible hives and hot to the touch, and she had a few areas of rash on her arms. She did not express any difficulty breathing. EMS was onsite and were immediately notified.  In the course of her evaluation by EMS, she drank water, used an ice pack on rash, and took her own Benadryl and reported that she was beginning to feel better after approximately 30 more minutes. EMS confirmed that she was stable and okay to leave. On-site DOHMH medical greeter informed her about v-safe, told her to talk with her PCP, and inform people at the time of her next vaccination.  At approximately 6pm, this reporter (non-medical professional) followed up with patient to check on her symptoms. She expressed that she was feeling better, the rash subsided but that her hands were swollen. This reporter reiterated the importance of following up with her regular medical provider.

Shortly after that shot i had a sore arm and left armpit lymph nodes for a few days. I noticed yesterday, a week after the shot, the lymph nodes were still a little sore. Then yesterday afternoon, my left shoulder started itching like crazy at the injection site, lasting for a couple hours. I looked and it was red where it itched, like three splotches the size of quarters but not very defined. This morning it is red over a larger swath, like a palm and a half on my shoulder. Feels sore and slightly hard under the skin, rather than itchy.

                                                Face swelling and redness with lip tingling and tongue tingling later after eating a few bites of a home prepared meal that has been eaten several times before. Started eating around 7 pm, have picture of red and swelling face at 7:11 pm. Contents of meal were shrimp, homemade egg noodles, chicken stock, pork, and romaine.  No breathing problems and felt fine besides face warm ness and some anxiety over possibly developing a new allergy, as these symptoms were similar to my adult onset allergies to oysters in 2011. Sought remote care at 7:41, spoke to RN over phone who recommended a video visit, then after video visit was recommended to go to urgent care. Arrived at Urgent Care around 8:50 PM.   Had a steroid shot of solumedrol 125 mg to IM the left arm around 9 pm, then took some Benadryl and famotidine at urgent care. Picked up prescriptions for famotidine 7 days, prednisone 4 days, and Benadryl as needed.  Taking medications now with careful watching of potentially allergic reaction provoking foods such as shrimp, fish, nuts, and wheat.

At first it wasn&#39;t hurting that much I just felt it was normal of the swelling and soreness, but then I started feeling more pain at night time when I tried to sleep. On Monday the 25th woke up feeling more pain bigger then a pea on my right armpit had a fever of 100.1 in the morning. I went to the doc around the same day in the afternoon. The doc said it was an infection and inflamed from the vaccine I recently got on Friday.

It was tender to touch and painful if I raised my arm above my head. It was as large as a quarter at times and visible. Had some tenderness and tightness in my left arm pit as well as behind my left knee. The node near my clavicle was noticeably swollen for two weeks. Tenderness and pain went away after a week. Arm pit pain was about a day. And back of the knee for about three days.

                                                There was very little pain until before bed the day I received the vaccine. At that time, I started feeling tenderness in the shoulder where I received the shot. The next day (today) the pain, inflammation, and swelling started moving down from my shoulder through to my fingers. I was barely able to get my wedding ring off because of the swelling. The tenderness now goes note my whole arm, under my arm pit, down my shoulder blade, and even my left breast. I have taken Benadryl for the swelling and tried to get it elevated, and I have taken ibuprofen for the body aches that I?ve had today as well.

Affected my daily activities and could not go to work.  I am a pharmacist, and this did really impact my job as my boss had to get other pharmacists from other cities to cover my shifts.   My work has a protocol related to covid, they will not let me back for a week.

                                                I received my covid vaccine on Saturday January 16, 2021, at 9:30am.  On Saturday January 23, 2021, at 1:00pm I noticed a lump appear by my left collar bone.  I went to a doctor on Monday 2/1/21, at 8:45am.  The doctor at the walk in clinic told me I needed to report this to the hotline as a adverse effect to the vaccine.  The doctor stated it was a swollen lymph node.  This swollen lymph node is on the same side as the injection was administered.  The doctor is calling it lymphadenopathy supraclavicular.  I am waiting to have a sonogram done on the lymph node.  I have been extremely fatigued and my appetite has been off since having this vaccine as well.

                                                I started to develop a reaction the first evening after receiving the vaccine. My arm was incredibly sore, I had neurological slip ups-i could not think thoughts fully all the way through and my tongue swelled overnight and I woke up to me frantically rubbing my tongue on my back teeth, which is extremely abnormal for myself.  the first night back started aching (I have never felt this pain before now), Developed swollen lymph nodes in my armpit and in my neck and chin on my right side of my body, was extremely lethargic.  and this continued for 3 days when the lymph nodes started to go down, and then an outbreak happened inside the right side of my throat, which is still in place today, seems to be healing now, but continued to get worse for 3 days before starting to heal. I am finally back to a normal level of energy and my mind seems to be working normally again, but my back is still in incredible pain.

                                                Patient stated that her adverse symptoms started 6 days after she got the first vaccine, on 29 January 2021. It began as swelling, and redness at the injection site. She stated she had hives that were itchy and raised on her left arm around the site, and on 30 January 2021 the hives spread down her arm. She also noted that the lymph node in her left axilla was swollen.  On 6-7 Feb 2021 patient stated that the rash has mostly resolved, but that she started having neck pain, on the sides of her neck, near her collar bone. This pain leads to a headache, which she has been taking Ibuprofen for. The Ibuprofen only helps with the headache pain, not the neck muscle pain. She also stated that since the 6 and 7 of Feb in the evening her chest begins to feel &#34;heavy, like something is sitting on it&#34;. Patient stated that she went to see her primary care provider at the end of January and was sent to an allergist, who did not believe it was an allergic reaction. She was not prescribed any medication.

                                                Sometime between 02/07/21 and 02/08/21 I noticed slight pain and swelling of lymph nodes in my left armpit region and the left side of my neck, close to the collarbone. I spoke to a medical professional and they informed me that there can be swelling of lymph nodes after the vaccine. Currently (02/11/21) I have no more pain, but the lymph nodes in my neck are still slightly swollen. I have no more pain in my armpit. This only occurred on my left side, which is where I received the vaccine. Additionally, sometime between 02/09/21 and 02/10/21 I started itching my left shoulder around the injection site. When I looked in the mirror there was a big (2-3inch) red circle around the injection. The edge of the circle was slightly puffy, and the whole thing is super itchy and stupid. No pain associated with it, just a lot of itching.

                                                Received the vaccine intramuscularly in right arm at 1:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and muscle soreness began approx. 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Fatigue and headache present by 3:00 PM on 3/3/21. Began hydrating with water and Gatorade at this time. Muscle pain and join soreness present from right shoulder to right hand by 4:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and stiffness in fingers of right hand by 5:00 PM on 3/3/21. Mild congestion, brain fog by 6:00 PM on 3/3/21. Any contact between right arm and other objects or surfaces caused significant pain by 8:00 PM on 3/3/21. Took 800 mg ibuprofin to alleviate pain (pre-existing tolerance to NSAIDs necessitates higher than normal dosages). Swelling of the right arm and hand identified by 9:00 PM on 3/3/21. Swelling was most significant in the hand, and accompanied worsening joint pain and stiffness in the fingers. Applied a cold pack to address swelling (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off). Could not identify these specific side effects in the information available online, took a Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Swelling decreased overnight and was gone by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21. Diarrhea began at 6:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Will continue to hydrate with water and Gatorade. At the time of this report, pain in right arm still present from shoulder to wrist and entire arm is tender to the touch, but pain level has lessened. Pain and stiffness in right side of neck present by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Lymph nodes in right underarm swollen by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and swelling is still present at the time of this report. Will continue with regimen of ibuprofin as needed.  * I am recovering fine at home, but I wanted to log these side effects for data collection purposes. I couldn&#39;t find any information about these side effects online and that really freaked me out, so I hope that writing this report will help people in a similar situation.

                                                Other side effects; Anaphylaxis; Anaphylaxis; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse, concerning a 32-year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced 2 episodes of anaphylaxis (onset: 28 Jan 2021 and 29 Jan 2021) and other unspecified side effects.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On an unspecified date patient took her first of two planned doses.

On 28 Jan 2021, the patient experienced the event of anaphylaxis (life threatening), within 30minutes after the second dose of vaccine. Hence, she received epinephrine and her condition did not improve so received a second dose of the same, also was treated with diphenhydramine and oxygen and sent home. Next day, on 29 Jan 2021, the patient again went into anaphylaxis, hence, received another epinephrine and was also given with prednisone due to which patient got better and was stable today. But, however, she still having other side effects but not anaphylaxis. The patient&#39;s clinical history says that on Sunday night she continued to be symptomatic with vaccine side effects. The patient was confirmed to be not pregnant. Treatment for event other side effects were unknwon.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.   The outcome of events anaphylaxis (onset: 28 Jan 2021) and anaphylaxis (onset date: 29 Jan 2021) was resolved on 29 Jan 2021. The outcome of event other side effects was considered unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The following day the patient&#39;s care giver noted a purple-ish rash of the feet and ankles. By the following day the rash was progressing and more prominant.  On 03/19/21 Patient presented to the emergency department with progressive rash on legs and new rash on hands.  Patient had no other symptoms, rash was otherwise asymptomatic except for feelings of cold extremities. Rash was identified by myself as Livedo Reticularis which is a moderate sized vessel vasculitis. This can be immune complex mediated. Sent to Dermatology for same day punch biopsy. Results currently pending.

                                                My upper left arm at the injection site was sore for the first three days, then the soreness was gone and I felt fine. After a week, I discovered tension on the upper left arm. It feels like the swelling persisted after a week and the injection site&#39;s skin temperature is also higher than my right arm.  I was using V-safe to report and track my symptoms. However the health check-in stopped Saturday, so I wasn&#39;t able to report this discovery.

But one week after the shot, it got red and swollen again, as well as itchy. Now it&#39;s been 8 days, and the site is a hard, hot lump, still red and itchy. It&#39;s not terribly annoying, but it is slightly worrying for the symptoms to be getting worse instead of better.

Localized back pain severe by afternoon, slightly responsive to ibuprofen. By 4 pm had hives in unusual patterns and places (i.e. quarter sized on left wrist, symmetrically on either side of neck like Frankenstein, and significant swelling of upper lip), itchy and aligned with histamine reaction. Back pain progressed, but mild by second morning. Whole right side of face swollen by morning of 3/25/21. Slowly reduced via ibuprofen and Zyrtec, but still present at time of submission. Odd spikes of intense hunger, and mild cognitive impacts like forgetfulness, distractibility, and some confusion. Tired.

I had no anxiety surrounding the receiving of the vaccine nor anxiety about potential side effects. I was standing still and upright at the time of the attack and it lasted appx 30-40 min, subsiding to feelings of heightened anxiety through the remainder of the night. While anxiety and panic attacks have occurred in the past, it is not on a regular basis, nor has either occurred in over 6 months.

This first presented around 11:00pm on Saturday 01/02/2021. I received my first dose of the moderna covid-19 vaccine on 12/28/2020. I did look on Moderna&#39;s website for further reaction information and it states that 4% of their test group reported this same symptom 5 to 7 days after first injection.

Due to area of lymphadenopathy, had to have breast exam, lab work and will need to schedule diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. If that comes back clear there are discussions of CT scan.

Numbness in tips of hands and toes.  Widespread bodyaches.  Swelling in lymph nodes of neck.  Cough, Stuffy nose.   In my clinical judgment, I also suspect a coincident viral upper respiratory infection in additional to vaccine adverse effect.

                                                On 1/7/21 I noticed a slightly enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node. There was a small amount of edema in the area surrounding it. I applied heat to it and this seemed to relieve some of the swelling. Around noon on 1/8/21 the lymph node and the tissue sounding it had approximately doubled in size from the night before. I went to my local urgent care center. The doctor seemed to think that there is a very high probability that it is my body reacting to the vaccine, especially since I still currently have a visible bruise on my arm from the injection.  The injection was on the same side as the swelling. She couldn&#39;t confirm that it is a reaction with 100% certainty, I was prescribed Keflex 500mg tabs TID for a week just in case there is an infection present.  I am supposed to monitor the size of the swelling and follow up with a PCP.

                                                Developed erythematous and pruritic raised rash at injection site on Day 8 that expanded until Day 13 (almost resembled erythema migrans prior to resolution). Rash resolved on Day 14. Applied topical prescription steroids on Day 9, which did not significantly improve rash. Rash essentially self-resolved.  On Day 5 developed left axillary lymphadenopathy that self-resolved on Day 11.

After palpating the area I noted that there was a movable, lump about the size of a small lime R axillary region. Went to urgent care to have it looked at due to the increasing discomfort. Doctor noted it to be an inflamed/swollen axillary lymph node. He prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dospak 21s.

Patient was taken to the ED for observation, remained hypotensive (90&#39;s/50&#39;s) for about an hour, then slowly returned to normal BP (110&#39;s/80&#39;s) over another hour. Patient likely did not require going to the ED, however was taken there as a precaution due initially to the length of time passed out and hypotension.  Prior to this episode, the patient only experienced soreness at the injection site. Following this episode, the patient felt some weakness and had a mild headache for another 24 hours before returning to baseline.

I also had some tenderness in my underarm which I blame on a lymph node but was  never able to feel a swollen one there. Both my underarm and collarbone area remained tender/sore for about two weeks. No systemic symptoms.

Over the next day a circular red rash appeared about 3-4? long and 2? wide with some mild swelling and the area remained itchy.  I only had soreness at the injection site that lasted 2-3 days before this developed.  I never developed fever, or any other side effects.  I did not take any medications for this rash because I am breastfeeding a 4 month old.  The rash is still faintly present and mildly itchy still, nearly 2 weeks after receiving the first shot and 1 week after this side effect first appeared.

                                                1 week after my injection I developed a approximate baseball size circle at my injection sight with mild warmth and tenderness and swelling. I had axillary lymph node swelling, neck muscle soreness, fatigue, and frontal and temporal headache. I still have a red circular area at my injection sight but it is gradually improving (4 days out from redness occurring). The symptoms seemed worse than the initial reaction the first few days after my injection. I am a health care provider and have taken photos daily but have not gone for an office visit at this time.

                                                Had normal reactions after the vaccine - swelling, itching, redness, and a knot.  It seemed to go away over about 7 days following the shot.  On day 8, it was itchy.  Then, it felt that the knot had enlarged.  It became warm to touch and a little red (not much).  It is not painful like it was after the injection.  It has not resolved, but it just started yesterday.  It is less red today, but it is about the same.

Disappeared on Sunday and then on Tuesday it returned large, red and hot. Went to the doctor to  be treated and they said I have cellulitis. As the cellulitis my body became itchy. Continued itching all over body while taking the antibiotic, unsure why I am very itchy. The redness is gone from the infection site and now I am experiencing itching on legs, arms, back.

                                                Shot was administered on 1/20/2021. By that Friday, my upper right arm (over my bicep) developed a red patch, which I had attributed to dermatographia.  Over the weekend, it began to raise up a bit from my skin and swell, and became warm to the touch. By Monday, 1/24/2021, the swelling had stopped, but the redness was noticeable on other parts of my upper arm, but not around the shot location. There is a bruise there from the shot, but no redness. The redness and warmth changes throughout the day, and at times is &#34;itchy below the skin&#39;s surface&#34;, where I&#39;m not able to scratch.

                                                So about 6-7 days after my whole arm got swollen but injection site was raised a good inch from my skin and there was a rash around it. This lasted for about 4-5 days before it went away/ It was hot to touch, itchy and painful.  I called my Doctor and she had no idea what to do and told me to call the vaccine person who did the vaccine. And he informed me  the injection may have been given wrong. I called Moderna and they basically gave me stats on the vaccine and I fell in the 1% and I was ok to get the second dose.

Wednesday was about 4/5in, more red/warm, a little itchy and soar to the touch. Thursday it was bigger, about 7in now from the bottom of my palm to the tips of my fingers and it?s swollen/red/warm, a little itchy and soar to touch still. Not hurting me, but I hope it goes down in a few days. I wasn?t expecting this to happen over a week after I got the vaccine.

Heart rate would increase to 120-130 with simple activities like cooking dinner or taking a shower. This was sometimes prolonged with standing and associated with shortness of breath.  The night sweats continued for the next 6 weeks until time of submission. The lymphadenopathy was also noted L axilla and R supraclavicular and has also persisted. 2nd covid moderna vaccine received 1/30/21 with only mild headache.

                                                Beginning the day after the shot I started with vaginal swelling which wasn?t terrible that day but by the second day (Thursday) it was severe. I worked that entire day not realizing just how bad it was but by the end of the day I could barely walk out to my car. I was in so much pain and so swollen that by the next day I could not do anything. I went to my GYN first thing that morning (Friday) where they swabbed to send for various tests which have all come back negative so far.  I had to return for a re-culture that had come back inconclusive and we are still waiting on those results. I have been given an antibiotic and prednisone which still have not resolved the swelling. I am about 50% resolved and almost 2 weeks later at this point but there is still significant internal swelling which is uncomfortable but not hindering me from working. I was out of work for an entire week and not able to do anything for that entire timeframe.

Over the next few days I experienced diarrhea, weakness, fatigue, extreme neck pain (on the same side as the injection), swelling and redness of my arm at the injection site (9 days after), a few hives on my face. It is currently 2 weeks after I&#39;ve received the vaccine and I feel extreme muscle aches, slight headache, and pain in my upper abdomen and back. I was in very good shape prior to receiving this vaccine but now when I go to the gym I cannot lift as much as I could before, nor do I have energy like I did prior to the vaccine.

A week after the shot my arm was really itchy and had a giant welt. It also looked like it had hives on the bump.

Wrse though, was the inability to bend my fingers after they swelled up and had incredibly itchy welts all over. Benadryl did not help0, the itching, soreness, and inability to bend my fingers persisted for approximately 4 days. I had a headache that was severe as well. I made two trips to the emergency room and then followed up with my primary physician.

During 1st 24 hours of having the 2nd dose I had chills, fever, body aches, sleeplessness. Symptoms subsided within 24-48 hours with the arm soreness taking about a week to completely go away.   A week and a half after receiving the 2nd dose I noticed a lump on my neck, lower middle near the collarbone. It is significantly pronounced. I saw my primary doctor for an already scheduled physical and she said I was fighting off an infection and it was normal. I mentioned I had the COVID vaccine and she said it isn&#39;t uncommon to see the lymph node swell after vaccination and it should go away in a couple of weeks. I wanted to report this because it can freak people out to see a lump in their neck so long after being vaccinated without any other symptoms. We need to list this as a possible side effect on the vaccine information. I feel completely fine except my neck is a little tender/sore from the swollen lymph node.

She was sent to Cardiology and they diagnosed her with pericarditis and she was started on scheduled NSAIDS. - Cardiology recommended ESR, CRP and CBC and they were negative. - CXR was normal - Echocardiogram was suggestive of pericarditis. Cardiology told her to follow up in 1 month is symptoms did not improve and they have not. Also she stated she has developed mild, intermittent peripheral edema that resolves without intervention but this is new.  I am also ordering the cardiac MRI which the cardiologist recommended if symptoms did not improve with NSAIDs.

                                                Five days after the initial dose, I noticed swollen lymph nodes near the armpit of my left arm.  I received the injection in my left arm.  The lymph nodes were tender and I experienced pain in the armpit area.  Seven days after the initial dose, I woke up in the middle of night feeling like my body was on fire with pain on my left side.  I took my temperature and it was 99.3.   Upon waking up in the morning one week after the initial dose, the swelling was gone in lymph nodes.  However, a red  rash appeared near the injection site on my left arm.  The rash was tender and warm to the touch.  My left arm was tight and painful.  As of day nine after the injection, the rash is itchy and has moved slightly down my arm.  Pain has diminished but there is still tightness in my upper left arm.

                                                I received both doses of the Moderna vaccine first on 1-11-2021 and the second on 2-14-2021. Both injections were given IM in the left deltoid by the hospital I work at. After the first vaccine I noticed I was having more vivid dreams than I ever have before and have worsened since the 2nd vaccine on 2-14-2021. On 3-3-2021 I began having pain in my left armpit that is very sore and swollen like a beast lymph node

My doctor prescribed me a Z pack.  Headache still went on till Sunday. Saturday I noticed the rash on my left arm where I had the vaccine.  Sunday it became bigger and started to tingly.  Monday morning rash is still there and now it&#39;s itchy.

                                                About 90 min post vaccine, my vision became extremely blurry. My heart rate and BP was elevated and remained elevated with any physical activity or exertion. I became &#34;swollen&#34; in the face and arm but did not break out in hives. My BP and pulse remained elevated for 4 days. By day 3, my lymphnodes in my armpit became extremely swollen. I have remained slightly swollen and periodically break out in hives without regular Benadryl and famotidine/cetirizine  doses.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA: Developed an instant rash at injection site. Over the course of the week since injection the rash has grown in size. Topical cream to reduce itch, cold pack application has temporarily provided relief but the rash has grown in size since initial onset. Doctor is aware of situation, as it is the weekend nothing can be done to create a course of action until Monday (3/15/21). A lymph node feels swollen under my arm,  the rash is raised and slightly circular, the rash is hot/warm to touch like it is sunburned but the rest of the arm is normal temperature. Wanted to report this side effect in full as I understand this can happen days after the vaccine. Mine was immediate. Again emphasizing that I am seeking medical assistance on Monday March 15th, 2021 to ascertain what can be done to alleviate symptoms.

She was not responsive to 4 albuterol nebs and an epinephrine drip and ultimately require intubation and mechanical ventilation. She stabilized on the ventilator but required a MEDEVAC to a civilian hospital for ongoing care.

                                                SORE ARM: March 5 at 7:00 pm - vaccination site on left arm started to feel sore. Lasted about 24 hours and then was gone. No treatment needed.   SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES: March 8 at 7:00 pm - felt a pop in right ear that felt like an earache accompanied by pain, which slowly traveled down under the jawline between ear and chin. Visibly swollen and painful lymph nodes under the jaw for the next 30 hours, then it went away.  Advil didn&#39;t help with the pain, no other treatment.   REACTION AT VACCINATION SITE:  March 12 - vaccination site on left arm itchy all day. Looked at it at 11:00 pm and it was about a 3&#34; itchy red circle around the vaccination site that was raised and hard, and emanating heat. Put aloe vera on it each morning and night.   Got about an inch larger over the next two days. Continued to emanate heat, less itchy.   March 14 at 11:00 pm - no longer a red circle, now the border was white but the center was normal. Was gone by the morning of March 15.

Injection site became itchy and hot and swollen and hard and raised. The next day the are covered grew. I used ice and Tylenol to mitigate symptoms but the injection site was not really affected. It remained raise, hot red etc.  Ibuprofen seems to have been more effective I  took it last night and this morning and the are was less hot and smaller. I went to my regular doctor he did not know about this condition but suggested I have ?covid arm.? He suggested I take Zyrtec and Benedryl to help everything calm down.

Today - a week after my shot - my arm is swollen, red, very hot, very painful, and a little itchy. I also feel pretty ill and strange.  I was also prescribed metronidazole and started that two days ago, and am wondering if that would contribute to this reaction.

I contacted a nurse and was told top prop my legs up while sleeping and to not take any medication. The next morning everything was back to normal.

                                                Patient received the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday (03/23/2021) at 10 AM on her left arm. She did not feel the injection. No immediate symptoms after the injection. Before 1 PM, she developed itching at injection site and started to scratch her arm. Noticed ~5 visible bumps around injection site. She started to feel hotness on the injection site. Patient noticed that she also had hives on her right arm and one hive on her abdomen. She was on her way to work. Went to the pharmacist and told them about her hives. Was recommended to take cetirizine. Took cetirizine, hives were relieved but notes she was still feeling itchy. Had itching on legs, stomach, arms, face throughout the day. Patient worked from 1:30 - 11:00 PM. Did not do a lot of heavy lifting. Was working in her office and around the store. After her shift, patient still had itching. She also noticed swelling on her cheeks, from her outer lips towards her cheeks. Took diphenhydramine and went to sleep. On Wednesday (03/24) morning, she had red lips and lip swelling, as well as facial swelling. Has never had dermal fillers. She was feeling very itchy, especially on her face. Took diphenhydramine, swelling improved. Patient was taking diphenhydramine every 6 hours. Took one diphenhydramine yesterday 3/25. Has not been taking cetirizine. When she is taking diphenhydramine, patient does not have itching. Patient still feels some itching if she does not take diphenhydramine. No lip tingling. Ongoing itching and hives. I instructed her to take Xyzal tablets (which do NOT contain polyethylene glycol) instead of Zyrtec or Benadryl tablets.   She is scheduled for allergy testing in 2 weeks, if her urticaria has resolved.

                                                On 3/24/2021 I woke up with pain in my lower right leg, that progressed to pain and pins and needles in all of my limbs, especially my hands and feet. The pins and needles progressed to loss of sensation and weakness. By 2/29/21 I woke up feeling weak in my limbs with difficulty walking and with balance. MRI of neck and head reveal not issues. Lumbar puncture showed no signs of infection or autoimmune markers but white blood cells and lymphocytes were elevated in spinal fluid. I began to experience increased fatigue and debilitating headaches 3/30/21 for about 1 week. I was prescribed 50mg Predsidone for aseptic meningitis. My symptoms subsided while on medication but have since returned. I experience pain, and pins and needles in my limbs and back, particularly in my hands, feet, and buttock when any amount of pressure is applied for an extended period of time.

                                                On a walk, legs, torso, and buttocks became unbearably itchy. It was about a mile walk and occurred about halfway through, upon arriving home, my entire body was red, skin was bumpy and swollen, and itchy was increasing. It started around 2:50pm and I took an extra dose of Cetirizine 10mg at 3:15pm.

Next day, 1/6, she called work to say she had chills and headache and would not be reporting to work.  At 2:00 pm, she felt her heart racing, and noticed face and lip swelling and tightness in her throat.  She called her PMD who directed her to go to urgent care.  At urgent care, she got an EKG, IV fluids, IV steroids, and IV antihistamine.  Symptoms resolved within 2 hours.

                                                Sore arm, body aches after day 2 of getting vaccinated, which was to be expected. I was concerned about last night on 1/6/21, where my L arm became extremely itchy, swollen and broke out in hives. Today, remains extremely itchy, swollen/raised and there is a red square over the injection site. The area of redness and swelling measures to be 3 inches by 3 1/2 inches and does not appear to be getting any larger as the day goes on. I did take 12.5 mg of benadryl, which has resolved some of the itching.

                                                Arm was bruised and tender to the touch approximately 3-4 hours following vaccine. Started feeling dizzy around 8pm on 1/7/21.  Took PM meds and went to bed. Awoke around 3am with a temp of 103, joint aches, muscle aches, chills, congestion, eyes very dry and itchy,  severe headache/migraine with photosensitivity, fatigue on 1/8/21. Left arm was swollen, hot to the touch and very tender to move it. Took Tylenol and Benadryl to help relieve symptoms. Put a heating pad on injection site. Felt about the same all day so I rested. Went to bed around 10pm on 1/8/21. Woke up around 4am on 1/9/21 and my temp was 99.7 prior to taking any meds and after about 20 minutes of being out of bed. On 1/9/21 I still have arm tenderness and bruising, fatigue, headache, left eye redness to upper eyelid with swelling, temp has been running at 99.7 and it?s currently 4pm EST.

                                                Self-reporting as pharmacist and patient. After Moderna vaccine, injection site reactions developed for 48 hrs following administration (moderate pain, swelling, warmth to touch). Injection pain then subsided. At 10 days after injection, large swollen lymph node under arm on injection side was noticed. The swelling of lymph node seems slightly diminished today (day 14 post injection #1). In conjunction with swollen lymph node, experiencing generalized malaise, fatigue, and neck lymph nodes seem slightly swollen. Routinely taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen for some symptomatic relief.

I&#39;ve been having these symptoms for 7 days now with no  improvement.

                                                I received my vaccination at approximately 7pm on Friday January 15th. Upon receiving my vaccinations I felt light headed, but after fifteen minutes I was okay to stand up and leave the facility. At around 12:05am  I began coughing and body aches and it continued throughout the night. By morning my cough had subsided, and I felt okay. By 11:30 am on 16th my body and skin began to tingle all over and I felt a burning sensation under my skin. My head began pound and a feeling of nausea came over me. I started feeling very warm about 10 minutes later and decided to take off my sweater and found that I had a large red rash across my chest. My temperature began to rise and my tongue and face began to swell and a feeling of shortness of breath came over me. By 4:00 my fever hit 104.2 and my body began to stiffen up  and my jaw began to clench involuntarily In small bursts for a total of what my family believes to have been 5-10 minutes. After taking 1000 mg of Tylenol my fever dropped to 103 for the next two hours and I began to shake uncontrollably, then it began to spike a again reaching 103.6. My spouse put cold towels on me and opened the windows to our bedroom to cool me down. Slowly my temperature started dropping and it finally reached 101 by 11pm. The next morning, Sunday, I woke with blisters on my mouth and severe body aches.

Swelling and torso had hives starting to form. Dr. gave me an injection of Solumedrol and sent me home to rest ansd to take benadryl.

                                                The night after the shot, I woke up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain in my L arm. I couldn?t touch it in any way, let alone move it or lay on it. The next morning when I got up, I could not move my arm whatsoever and it was one of the worst pains I?ve ever felt. Even superficial touch to the skin anywhere on my deltoid/shoulder/bicep made me jump to the ceiling in pain. Around noon (so almost 24hrs after the shot), I developed a 100* fever, severe aches, chills, and my arm hurt worse and worse. I felt like I needed an arm/shoulder brace it hurt so bad and this went on the whole day. The next day (Tues), my arm hurt a little less but my entire deltoid was bright red, warm to the touch, enlarged, and still painful although not as much as before. As an RN, I?ve never seen or felt a reaction like this to a vaccine/medication. I?ve never reacted to anything like this before.  Oddly when I received the vaccine, I didn?t feel the injection at all.

However, speaking to my co workers, their painful arm went away after 2 or 3 days.  Mine still hurts over a week afterwards.  I got my vaccine on a Saturday. Wednesday night, I started feeling pain in my armpit.  It has continued and not stopped.  Feeling around, it feels like my lymph nodes are swollen under my armpit.   Saturday night (a week now after the vaccine), the vaccination site on my arm started itching unbelievably. Nothing would help it. It subsided by Sunday morning but now I noticed the skin around my vaccination site is pink/red.  Not infected looking, just like the coloring of the skin is different, almost like  a sunburn.  Again, still have painful, swollen lymph nodes under my arm and my armpit hurts when I move my arm.

                                                I was experiencing what I understand to be one of the more common side effects: pain at injection site. This pain kind of traveled to other parts of my arm and eventually my arm pit. I noticed the pain travelling around the date of 1/2/2021, and by 1/6/2021 it getting more intense. As I was trying to massage out the soreness, I noticed a palpable, painful lump in my right breast. I did not immediately recognize it as a swollen lymph node at that time, but after several Dr exams, and the lump and pain decreasing, I believe that is what was happening. I do still have the lump, and it is tender, so I am currently monitoring it.

On the 6th day after the injection I got a swollen, painful lymph node in my left armpit. On the 7th day after injection I started getting a welt on my left upper arm. It was itching, hot and red. It grew quickly and I went to the ER. For the next 2 days the welts more than doubled every 8 hours when the Benadryl wore off. The mass was red, hot, itchy, slightly numb, painful and got so big it prevented my arm from having a full range of movement.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the shot, I started having intense dizziness, and nausea, and my body felt very hot. My eyes teared up  as well.  This feeling subsided a little after 15 more minutes, so I went home.  At home (and within 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine), the lymph nodes in my throat swelled considerably and I had great difficulty speaking.  Having experienced anaphylaxis in the past, this was not anaphylaxis but something else entirely - it was like my vocal cords were paralyzed.  I took ibuprofen to help with the swelling, but it did not seem to impact my throat or ability to speak. About 4 hours later my throat muscles seemed to loosen and I was able to speak fairly normally again.

                                                24 hours after vaccine, had fatigue, lymph node swelling that lasted 1 week, joint pain starting the next day in knees and ankles. Then 4th finger on right hand that has pins in it started to swell and become painful in the 8th two days later the ring finger on other hand started to swell and become painful, then pinky swelling on both hands a day after that. Then pain and swelling started to subside around the 22nd then gone by the 24th. I am supposed to get my second vaccine tomorrow and I am wondering if this is still advised or will lead to a much more severe response. I reported weeks ago and never heard back from anyone.

Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

Night of Jan3, I developed red, hive like rash around the injection - painful; swollen and my lymph nodes were swollen in my armpit as well. It progressively spread through my whole arm within 24 hours and looked like a &#34;poison oak&#34; rash. I took Benadryl. I emailed my doctor about (PCP). I missed a day of work on January 5th. The rash got three days progressively. The lymph node pain was gone about a week after. I did have the dr write a prescription for the second dose for an epi-pen but didn&#39;t have to use it.

                                                By the middle of the night after receiving the vaccine I woke up with flu like symptoms - cold, chills, fever, body aches. They lasted for about 2 full days. The other side effect I experienced was a severe migraine which lasted for about a week. Also experienced pain/soreness at the injection site but that was actually worse with the first shot than it was with the second.   After those symptoms subsided I experience swollen lymph nodes in my body which were seen in an ultrasound but am unsure if this was unrelated to receiving the vaccine.

My lymph node was sore in my left arm pit as well as on left side of my neck which made swallowing uncomfortable which both started on day 2, lasting until day 4 after the shot.

Swelling of all lymphnodes.

                                                Sore arm, headache, fatigue onset a few hours after vaccination. The next day swollen and sore lymph nodes added. The day after that, symptoms began to slowly subside, lasting through 2/16.  Mild but tolerable symptoms popped up and went away through 2/26. On 2/27 an intense headache came on before bed. 2/28 I was so sick, I slept through the day. Fever, exhaustion, chills, loss of appetite, dizziness, muscle weakness, complete loss of appetite (no nausea). These symptoms have been persistent since. My energy level is up enough that I&#39;m awake for more of the day, but still in bed.

I had it checked  (sonogram and blood work) and it was a healthy swollen node most definitely a side effect of the vaccine. The lymph node started to get smaller but after I got my second vaccine it got even larger than it was before.   I didn&#39;t feel sick after the first shot, but was sick after the second - I experienced weakness and body aches for one day.

                                                On 3/18 my arm started itching and had a knot at the vaccine site.  I also felt clammy/nauseous.  As the evening went on, the swelling grew and I just felt under the weather.  This morning (3/19) I went to UrgentCare.  The swelling is bright red and very hot to the touch.  The doctor thinks my arm is infected and has started me on antibiotics.

I called my sister and advised me to go see my Dr. I saw my Dr. the next morning and he felt it and said it was my lymph node and collar bone that was swollen and its an indication that you have Cancer in abdominal area, and I have been getting coloscopy since 20 because I have pre-cancerous cells. He ordered a CT and MRI and colonoscopy. The colonoscopy came back clear. The CT or abdomen, collar bone all came back clear.  They did a EDG, that came back clear. The next step was a biopsy, and made an appointment to see a General Surgeon. It started to not be as large.  When I got my second dose it was very painful a red.  I&#39;m still having issues but all test have came back clear. I have cancelled the General surgeon appointment, I really believe it&#39;s cause of the vaccine and all my test are clear.

The longer the day went on, the larger and warmer (and more tender) the lump got. It was also red. I began to run a fever, which I attributed to this, but I was diagnosed with Covid-19 4 days later (on 3/22/21), so the fever could have been unrelated to ?Covid Arm.? I applied topical Benadryl to my arm and took Benadryl, orally, that night. The next morning, the swelling, redness, and tenderness of the lump had gone down. By the 24-hour mark, all symptoms were gone.

                                                On Feb 22,  2021 I had my annual physical with my Primary Care Dr (PCP), and she noticed my CBC panel reflected low platelet count of 67, so she referred me to a specialist and I made an appointment with a hematologist for March 23, 2021. My PCP told me that if I noticed bleeding symptoms that I should go to the ER. I had no previous CBC panels with low numbers.  On March 14, at 1:30am I noticed petechiae on my face, lower abdomen, and back of lower legs and I had been feeling fatigued the previous 2 days. I went to the Hospital ER and they took a total panel and the CBC panel came back with low platelet count of 24. They admitted me to the hospital for treatment and monitoring.   The hospital administered treatment of dexamethasone for 3 days intravenously as well as intravenous immunoglobulin for 2 days. My body and platelet count responded well to the treatment and I was released from the hospital on March 16 around noon.  During the following days from the hospital I experienced severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, and night sweats until March 20. I still experience extreme fatigue and night sweats.   I had a follow up blood panel on March 19, which showed stabilized numbers. And I had a follow up appointment with Dr to discuss possible causes (one being the covid vaccine due to the temporal relationship) and planning for treatment (follow up blood panel in 2 months and then every 4 months after that to monitor platelet levels).

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

                                                One week after Dose 1, I exercized heavily with my arms.  The next day, my vaccine location was again red, warm, and raised.  There was no rash, as in patients describing &#34;covid arm.&#34;  It was not very painful, either.. but I did do a good job keeping my arm mobile for both vaccines.  Two weeks after Dose 1, I got a rash for the first time in my adult life (I&#39;m almost 35 years old).  The rash was localized to be just on my &#34;seat&#34; area... literally.  That took over a week to dissipate, but eventually I didn&#39;t notice it.  One week after Dose 2, I woke up with red swollen hands, a swollen rash on the undersides of my forearms, a little on my stomach, and a little rash on just the instep arches of both feet.  The rash was spreading, so I was advised to go to a clinic.  Unfortunately, that clinic didn&#39;t do any bloodwork, but they sent me home with scripts for prednisone and famotidine thinking I was having an allergic reaction to the pizza I ate the previous night.  I also got a shot in the butt.  The rash and swelling dissipated by over 50% by the next morning.  However, after a day of work and movement, I realized the rash was still spreading and I was now gaining weight.   It is now 3/26, which is two weeks after receiving the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.  The rash is still spreading around my skin.  I completed my medication and now I am monitoring the rash on my own.  The oldest sites seem to be healing.  It is now contained to my stomach, mostly lower abdomen, around the sides and to the back... also very swollen and itchy (now) in my seat and groin area.

I&#39;m prone to anxiety - so on Friday night I was extremely anxious and didn&#39;t sleep until 3am. On Saturday, the armpit pain became worse especially at night.  Again didn&#39;t sleep until 4am. There is swelling and pain still on Sunday morning.  I&#39;ve iced and put a warm compress on them which is helping slightly but the swelling and pain is still there.

I reported to my doctor who told me to do cold compresses and hydrocortisone a few times a day and after 3-4 days that went away.  Since the 1st dose on 2/25/2021, I have had random muscle aches in my legs, stiff/sore neck on the left side, and my arm is sore maybe every 2-3 days at the injection site (the arm soreness happened moreso after the 2nd dose though). I also have a stiff toe on my right foot (2nd toe in next to my pinky toe) when I walk on it; when I grab my toe to feel for an injury or check for bruising, there is nothing and it feels normal. It&#39;s only when I walk on it does it randomly hurt throughout the day. I am not certain if this is coincidental or related but wanted to also include this since it started 2-3 days after my 2nd dose.

                                                12 days following the vaccine administration I noticed redness on my arm around the injection site. This redness was hot to the touch and rather large, exceeding the deltoid muscle and going down into my bicep. I also felt radiating soreness into my armpit and left breast.  The following day the rash had grown in size and felt hot to the touch on my entire upper arm with swelling and edema that affected the movement of my arm and hand. Continued soreness and pain in my armpit, left breast and down my arm into my fingers and up into my neck.  I proceeded to go to the urgent care as directed by Clinic employee health and my PCP. There was I was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescriped Keflex for 7 days, 3x a day.  It has been recommended that I seek further medical care due to my reaction, but this has yet to be scheduled.

                                                Initially had a typical injection site reaction the day of the shot (about 4 hours later). This included a round circle of redness and swelling around the injection site, along with pain and warmth. This subsided, fading to a bruise and pain went away. On the morning of Day 7 after vaccination my injection site became very itchy and progressively red throughout the day. On the morning of Day 8 I woke up to my injection site being very swollen and bright red. My entire arm is swollen, up into my face. My arm is extremely hot. The itching is better but painful now.

Lasted approximately 3 days then resolved. 1/1/2021-In the morning noted hives/rash/itching/obvious line of demarcation to the injection site in my left shoulder.  Through the morning noted the hives spread up my neck and angioedema noted to both sides of my neck, lymph nodes swelling on both sides and the injection site became more swollen and turned very hard to the touch.  No difficulty breathing at baseline, but it becamer difficult to take a full breath and chest tightness with exertion.  Benadryl 50 mg was taken 4-6 times a day for 3 days.  PA consulted, who stated to stay with Benadryl regimen, steroids not currently recommended, call 911 if symptom worsen.

                                                A little over 2 days after the vaccine, I had a horrible headache. Thought nothing of it, took Excederin migraine and went to bed. Woke up Thursday feeling fine, then by 5 pm, was very run down, had a mild headache, and had an intense sinus pressure under my eyes. My neck hurt and was sore to the touch in the front. When I bent over, it felt like my head was going to explode from pressure. No other symptoms or anything to be alert about. Took a Mucinex before bed, hoping that it would move anything that might be clogging my sinuses, went to sleep. Woke up Friday feeling okay, with just a tiny remnant of a headache. Around 1 pm, intense sinus pressure returned, worse than the previous day. Decided to go to local healthcare clinic around 3:30 pm. PA looked at ears, throat, all looked okay. Only symptom was swollen lymph nodes in neck, same side as the vaccine was administered. Covid tested (subsequent results were negative). Saturday, had less pressure, and spent the day laying around. By Sunday, was feeling back to normal. Peak of incident was definitely Friday.

                                                Axillary lymph node swelling, rash on left arm which has migrated from injection site. Painful when pressure is applied, intermittently itchy, and feels tight.  Injection site pain has been present since the day after the dose, but I only feel it when applying pressure on it (e.g., when lying in bed). Feeling of tightness began a few days ago near underarm crease. Rash on left arm (near armpit and also on shoulder) began today. Today was also the first day I noticed the lump in my underarm (which I assume is a swollen lymph node).

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

Adverse reaction started with minor muscle aches  then about 12hr after I started with a fever/ chills that got very severe during the night. Finally around 1am/2am the fever started to break.  I took Tyenol 500mg every 4 to 6 hours x 5 doses in the 24hr period.

                                                They were aware about what happened previously, so I had to wait longer. I started getting cotton mouth, so they gave me water. I had a bad rush where I felt like I was about to throw up, I had a migraine and very flush. I started vomiting. My arms started to hurt. I got hives again and they gave me two more Benadryl. They monitored me for another 30 minutes. They said I got super pale. They tried to give me ginger ale and crackers, but my stomach wouldn&#39;t allow it. They monitored me for a while longer and I felt better. I went home and woke up the next morning feeling terrible. Vomiting, swelling, muscle aches. I was in bed the whole time and I missed 4 days of work. I went back Tues 19th.

When I got home from work, I noticed what looked like 3 round/oval shaped redness and swelling spots that were warm to touch on my arm, I applied Benadryl cream and that helped decrease. The next day the three spots had became one and was the size of a tennis ball; it was red, a little swollen and warm to touch. The following day (today 01/24/2021) the the redness and swelling had grown about 6 inches wide and 5 inches in height; I took Benadryl 25 mg po and within 30 minutes then swelling and redness had began to decrease, warm to touch was still there and it began to get a little itchy but very manageable, I applied benadryl cream and that seemed to help a little, but when cream wore off it began to get a little itchy, but still very manageable; I did not reapply the cream.  No pain or discomfort at the area of concern on any days above.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

                                                7 days after I got the shot, the skin at the vaccine administration site started itching. When I scratched it, some blisters burst and a big area on my arm swelled up. It was hot to the touch, visible as a red, raised circle about 5cm in diameter. The swollen area felt hard and itched intensely and hurt for several days. By 01/25/21, it had faded and by 01/26/21 the itching stopped.

Symptoms worsened, raised red patch on deltoid approx. 10cm x 15cm and itching towards armpit chest. Took oral antihistamine and saw only slight worsening throughout the rest of the day. On today, 1/27 increased fatigue and worsening of lymph tenderness, red patch on injection site larger by about 2cm. Symptoms persisting, no outcome to report at this time.

As of the date of this report, the lymph node remains swollen, the size has not changed, it is discomforting, and at times restricts my neck movement. I went to Urgent Care on January 27, 2021 and they advised they were not sure the cause. I have taken an X-Ray (the results showed everything was normal); I took a blood test (results pending) and I have a follow-up appointment with my PCP for February 2, 2021.

                                                Woke up Sunday morning around 0700 1-24-2021 after had receiving my 2nd dose of the vaccine the day prior and was feeling all the normal muscle aches, pain and fatigue. At that time I was also experiencing a severe headache at the base of the back of neck, my neck was very stiff and one of my lymph nodes at the base of the front of my neck had swelled to the approximant size of a half dollar and raised up about 1 to 1 and 1/2. inches. The site where the swelling was located was very sensitive to the slightest touch, also on the same arm I received the injection. About 2 hours after waking, I started experiencing dizziness and nausea very suddenly to the point where I had to sit myself down in the hall way for a few minutes. I thought at one point I needed to call an ambulance as I made my way to lay down on my couch because I felt so sick. With in about 15 minutes after laying still on the couch the overwhelming need to vomit came over me. Which I did do for a good 5 minutes. There was quite a bit of relief from the nausea and dizziness shortly after but remained present the entire day. However the severe head ache continued until the morning of 1-27 and the lymph node still is slightly swollen with sensitivity to the touch.

More unusual adverse events: 1) Approximately 24 hours after receiving the shot, my Restylane Lyft fillers (tear troughs and cheekbones) became  swollen and painful. The visible swelling lasted only about a day, but as of this report, the area is still tender. 2) I experienced bleeding gums when I brushed my teeth the morning and evening of the day after the vaccine and once more (less blood present) on the morning of 1/28.  There was no more visible blood when I brushed my teeth on the evening of 1/28.

I have a history of chronic urticaria and they have been this bad before, however, they have not been this bad since 01/2018 and I have not needed any treatment for them since 06/2019. Since I stopped treatment in 06/2019 I have not had more than 1 or 2 small ones on my lower legs (which is where they usually occurred or 1 of my ears would be slightly warm, red, and swollen so I wanted to report it since it was so close to after receiving the vaccine. I took a Benadryl and iced the large hives on the nape of my neck and my ears which helped but did not resolve the issue.

Only my left side was swollen, as my doctor has told me in the past that they Injects much more filler on that side due to physiological differences that she is trying to balance.   I got these fillers I think july 2020  No other signs of side effects other than mild swelling od the left side of face. Took an antihistamine around 9:00am.

                                                I did not have any adverse side effects with the first vaccine. The second vaccine was very different, which I know is common (nausea, fatigue, headache, fever, chills, body aches), but after 48 hours my arm became very red and swollen. The injection site is bruised and the redness and swelling is going down my arm from my shoulder to my bicep. I took Benadryl last night and will take Benadryl and Ibuprofen tonight and if the swelling gets worse a doctor will call me in a prescription for a steroid.

I developed a rash throughout the day that spread to approximately 3-4 inches in diameter where I received the vaccine. The rash lasted 48 hours and gradually faded. The injection site still itches and is sore to the touch.

Head ache for 1 week.  8 days after injection the injection site swelled up like a bad bug bite and a red, hot, itchy, swollen rash spread down upper left arm almost down to the elbow.  Took over two weeks to go away.  **5 weeks post-vaccine, I woke up with leg pain the spread for one week down to my foot and up to my groin area (just in the leg and foot).  My leg developed red marks up the inner thigh and inside of calf.  My calf and ankle have now been severely swollen for 3 days and they are still swollen.  The pain was so severe that it hurt to touch lightly and even worse with deeper touch and it hurt to walk.  The pain has decreased but is still there 1 week after the reaction with my leg.  My doctor diagnosed me vasculitis.  I had autoimmune issues in high school (Graves&#39; Disease) so my Dr. wonders if I had some sort of autoimmune response to the vaccine.  She said it could have been life threatening if I got the 2nd injection, which I should have gotten a couple weeks ago.  I did not get the second shot.

                                                About 7-8 days days after 1st dose, noticed a large area near injection site that looked like a bruise, the next day the area had expanded and turned red (the bruise &amp; discomfort from the initial injection had resolved several days prior to this appearing). It was firm/mildly swollen and warm to the touch, and appeared to expand further throughout the day. When first measured it was approximately 2.75 inches across at it&#39;s widest point and a border was drawn to track changes. Two days later it was ~3.75 inches across at its widest part and we drew another border to track. It has continued to expand past the borders. Swelling also noticeably increased in my upper arm and axilla (also has intermittent itching). Treatment has consisted of benedryl at night and occasional ice packs. Ice decreases redness temporarily, but then returns and the area has continued to expand.

The area was hot and red, and had a raised welt. In the morning there was also a smaller circular rash  forming on my left collarbone consisting of small red bumps.  My armpit was starting to ache, which I realized was due to some enlarged lymph nodes that I could easily feel with my hand. All symptoms had worsened by the evening, so I took one benadryl before bed. 2/17/2020 All symptoms persisted (and are currently persisting). Collarbone rash of bumps has merged together into one large hive, bigger than a 50-cent coin.

Enlarged lymph node didn&#39;t start until around 38 hrs later and although it has reduced significantly it is still a bit enlarged.

                                                at 2am I woke up with fever, chills, headache, and nausea. I took tylenol and it improved. I slept on and off. When I got up the next morning at 6am, I realized I had mastitis on my right breast ( I got the vaccine in my left arm.) The mastitis consisted of redness around the areola, pain, swelling, and my lymph node in my right armpit felt slightly enlarged and painful. My fever was 100.9

My fever peaked at 101.2 at 2am. Pain relievers and fever reducers did not help. I had cold sweats throughout the night, not able to sleep consistently through the night due to body aches, headache and nausea. Left arm became swollen, hot and hard to the touch, this lasted through 2/17/21. The arm was itchy from 2/18-2/20/21. The fever and body aches lasted through 2/16 until about 10:15pm, around 11:00pm the headache went away. I was feeling mostly recovered with the exception of the arm by the morning of 2/17.

Each day since, it&#39;s kind of gone up and down, from almost not there, to fairly swollen and red and itchy and again, sometimes with a rash around it. There&#39;s a hard lump below the red area that&#39;s tender if I touch it. The day after the vaccine, my arm was sore, but that only lasted a couple of days, like getting a regular vaccine, just a bit worse. I had a sore throat for two days, starting 2 or 3 days after the vaccine, and symptoms like I was about to come down with a cold- congestion, fatigue, raspy voice. Those symptoms lasted until a week after the vaccine, but seem to be subsiding.

GI issues persisted for the next 3 weeks and on Thursday evening, 2/25/2021 at about 6:30 pm. I was sitting on floor with children and almost passed out. I felt very faint, dizzy, and instantly started chilling. I had a fever of 102.8 and could not get warm. My husband was going to call paramedics, but I encouraged him not to. Discovered my right breast was red and inflamed/ swollen as well as all of my lymph nodes in my right arm pit. I could not reach my right arm forward. I noticed around 12:06 AM after not being able to get warm or break fever. I messaged my primary care clinic when I noticed the breast swelling, redness, pain, and lymph node swelling. I continually felt like I was going to faint/pass out and was very dizzy all night long. I was also extremely fatigued. The did a telemedicine appointment the next morning and diagnosed me with mastitis and prescribed me antibiotics. I am a breastfeeding mother and all of these symptoms came on suddenly and severely on the same side that I got the vaccine shot. I have been breastfeeding for over 7 months and my supply has been dwindling to nothing so I have no problems with engorgement or blocked milk ducts. Before this baby I had just got done breastfeeding a baby for 11 months with no issues of the like.

It is 1 week after the injection and I feel the injection area hot, red and itchy. This week since vaccine I have felt soreness in arm, extreme tiredness and constant headaches.

Very bad nasal drainage and sneezing from 3/15 to 3/16. Felt like i had developed severe allergies all of a sudden, but i don&#39;t have any allergies that i know of. The drainage cleared and i felt fine on 3/17, then woke up for work with the swollen lymph node, only on the left side.

It was initially bumpy closest to the injection, but after about 12 hours, no longer is. After 24hrs it?s very red still on the outer area, and this is the itchiest part. The injection is still quite firm and more painful to the touch.

                                                Patient called pharmacy via telephone to discuss that she thought she was having an allergic reaction to the moderna vaccine that she received on thursday (2 days ago). She described that it started as tingling roughly 10-20 minutes after the vaccine resulting in swelling around her lips characterized by an odd tingling, dry, itchy area with tiny hard to see bumps - I discussed with patient the possibility of cold sore - pt states they have had cold sores before but it has never felt like this before - she stated this started after receiving the moderna vaccine on thursday - I advised follow up w MD to evaluate need for exam / diagnosis of possible allergy to vaccine vs symptoms being unrelated to the vaccine, and to do this sooner rather than later and definitely before she receives the next dose of moderna vaccine just to be sure. I advised discussing with the MD the need for epi-pen prescription or discuss risk vs benefit of getting the second vaccine, before she gets the next dose of vaccine, due to facial swelling and possible allergy - advised if facial swelling continued to get worse or began to compromise breathing to seek medical care, although it seems unlikely this would occur due to the shot being administered days ago and symptoms do not appear to be progressing. I advised using an antihistamine (claritin or zyrtec during the day and benadryl at night) to see if this helps with swelling/reaction - advised that if this helps that it may indicate higher likelihood of this being an allergic reaction to the shot and to report this to the MD as well. patient confirmed that she will be following up with MD to discuss.

When I woke up the next morning, January 4th, the injection site was swollen to the size of a softball, hot to the touch, red and very hard and painful. No treatment successful as of yet. I have not seen a Healthcare professional because I haven&#39;t found one that knows what to do for it yet. Just spoken to nurses over the phone.

On 1/1/2021, I noticed that my arm was again sore; upon inspection, I found that the welt had returned. It was again large, red, swollen, hot to touch and very itchy. As of today (1/6/2021), it is just a slight bruise.

                                                Upon vaccination, I had mild soreness in my right arm muscle on day 1 and day 2 (I have been reporting to the VSafe app). There were NO other symptoms or side effects including NO redness, lump/swelling, itching, etc.  I felt fine. I woke up Wednesday, January 6th at 8am  to some itching on my injection site. When lifting my shirt to look at it, I found a quarter sized, red swollen lump that was a little sore and hot to touch.  I contacted my hospital employee COVID phone hotline and spoke with a nurse who transferred me to a doctor (11am) I sent a photo and described my arm. Dr. stated that it was unlikely an allergic reaction due to it being 1 week later. She diagnosed me with cellulitis and started me on Bactrim antibiotic. I took my first dose at 8pm on 1/6 and at 2:30am I woke up with stomach cramps and diarrhea. I woke up again on 1/7 with an elevated temperature at 99 and feeling nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, slight body aches and a large, red hot touch spot on my left ankle (I had a spider bite on my left ankle in Sept 2020 that was treated with Bactrim it healed no issues but this flare up occurred same spot). I continued to take the Bactrim (3 pills total since receiving the rx) and still felt sick. I spoke again with a new COVID hotline doctor on the phone APRN CNP who stated she believes I in fact do not have cellutitis but rather an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine and therefore I should cease taking the Bactrim and start Benadryl. I did that at 7pm 1/7 went to bed woke up and my ankle was better as was my arm although you can still see the circle. I followed up on 1/8 with APRN CNP via secure messaging with photos and she stated again I likely am allergic and to monitor.

                                                At the time of injection no issues other than sore arm. Day 9 post injection developed significant swelling, redness, warmth, and rash like irritation in left arm. Over the past 5 days there has been some decrease in swelling but the redness has formed a circle and has flare ups of rash, warm, and irritation. I have been taking benadyl, zyrtec, and cortisone cream to try and relieve symptoms.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

MOUTH BECAME DRY, THROAT WAS SORE. BY THE NEXT DAY, 1-11-21, MY FACE BECAME SO SWOLLEN THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE SWELLING WAS GOING TO STOP BECAUSE MY FACE HAD JUST GOTTEN SO BIG. MY FACE LOOKED LIKE I WAS A 300LB WOMAN AND I AM ONLY 137LBS. I WENT TO THE ER. DR. GAVE ME A STEROID INJECTION AND PRESCRIBED ME AUGMENTIN AMOXICILLIN. HE DID A STREP THROAT TEST, MONO TEST AND COVID TEST. ALL CAME BACK NEGATIVE BY THE END OF THAT DAY, THE SWELLING WENT DOWN. OVER THE NEXT FIVE DAYS, THE SWELLING WENT DOWN AND WAS COMPLETELY GONE BY THE SIXTH DAY.

                                                I started feeling really sick on Christmas evening, lots of cough, productive cough. My lymph nodes on my left were very sore, I also had a sore throat, body chills, joint pain, mainly in my hands and fingers, extreme fatigue and it lasted through Wednesday and Thursday. My cough got really bad and I had to start on an albuterol nebulizer because of my cough/wheezing.

                                                8 days after the vaccine, her arm broke out with swelling and was hot to the touch.  It had a very red, itchy ring around the site of the shot. Did not take anything or put anything on it. Did not let her doctor know.  About 3 days later, it went away.   Got the second shot on day 28 (1/20/21).

Vaccine received at 4:15 pm . 45 minutes after receiving vaccine my tongue began to tingle. It then began to swell. Within next 20 minutes I had facial swelling and redness on my checks. I had no problems breathing or swallowing. Took 50 mg of Benadryl. Did not improve and took 20 mg of prednisone. Swelling stopped increasing. Anything I put in my mouth the taste was intensified. Pop tasted flat. Took 10 mg Zyrtec and 20 mg Pepcid.  By 11 pm the redness was gone in face. Swelling was going down in face. Tongue was still swollen. At midnight took 25 mg of Benadryl. At 6:45 am when I woke I had no more swelling but my tongue is still tingling. All day my tongue hurt and as of 7:20 pm it still hurts at the tip. During the day I had a headache. Arm pain.  Spoke with allergist and advised to continue the increase dose of Zyrtec Thursday.

                                                On 1/19/21 noticed a cluster of red bumps on arm around 7 pm, applied benadryl and went to bed. Woke up the next morning to a circle of red in the area. Treated with more benadryl and ice. The following day it was not as red but the spot was 3 inches wide X 4 inches long, went to the Doctors office who measured it. The following day the color was less red, more skin color - was warm to the touch and had little bumps on the skin outside of the original circle. The following day the discoloration was gone and the bumps were smaller.

I also had tender axillary lymph nodes, first on the same side I recieved the vaccine, a day later on both sides. Symptoms were the worst during the 24 hours after recieving the vaccine. After this, the only remaining symptoms were tender axillary lymph nodes and pain in the injection site. I used Acetaminophen for symptoms.

Swelling caused moderate pain and mild difficulty swallowing with mild breathing obstruction/discomfort. Onset of symptoms was roughly 10-12 hours post Moderna injection #1. Symptoms abated somewhat with Benadryl and NSAIDs. Raspy voice, pain in neck/chin jaw from swelling, visible swelling of lymph nodes and discomfort (somewhat positional) when breathing, swallowing, speaking. Night #1 was severe. I may have gone to the ER if I was not so immunocompromised. Day 2 was uncomfortable/painful but better with NSAID use. Night 2 had increased swelling and pain that improved after taking Benadryl and Singulair and nightly dose of Celebrex. Day 3, I am a bit uncomfortable with mild pain and visible swelling, but improved from Day 2.

                                                6 minutes after receiving vaccine patient reported that her tongue was starting to swell and that her heart was racing.  Staff called 911 immediately.  Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA. Approximately 1 hour after the shot on Thursday, January 28th, the left side of my face was mildly numb from the eyebrow down to the jawline. On Friday, I felt the numbness behind my left ear and left jaw. On Saturday, I felt the numbness around my left ear and jaw. Monday, I went to an urgent care facility. The doctor recommended that I take Advil and apply a warm compress but the diagnosis was NOT Bell&#39;s palsy. He hypothesized my trigeminal nerve was triggered by something, not explicitly attributing it to the vaccine injection. Tuesday, I had soreness on the left side of my neck. Wednesday, my lymph node in my left armpit is sore. Thursday (2/4/21), I had soreness on the left side of my neck.  Friday, I still have soreness on the left side of my neck and left upper chest area.

                                                I received my vaccine last Friday at the Health Department Facility. Six days later, I noticed that my neck was hurting and my lymphnode on my left side that the injection was given was swollen.  I didn&#39;t worry too much about it.  I figured the vaccine was doing what it was supposed to do.  On day 7 after the shot, my arm was swollen like a baseball, red rash and hot to the touch.  I called my general doctor who told me to go the ER as he didn&#39;t feel this was a normal reaction.  I ended up going to Urgent Care on February 5 at 6pm.  There, the nurse practitioner said she had been reading about people who have been given the moderna shot getting a reaction a week after getting it.  She said that she would give me a steroid if it didn&#39;t get better, but for now to take ib prophin and benedryl.  On day 8 after injection (today) the rash has gotten bigger.

Lymph node measured 4 cm x 2.9 cm x 3.9 cm and is described as having a thin cortex and fatty hilum. Said lymph node was biopsied via core needle and fine needle aspiration on 02/02/2020 and pathology is consistent with reactive lymphoid changes, with lymphocytes and red blood cells present. Sample was sent to Lab for additional testing and results remain consistent with reactive follicular and paracortical hyperplasia.

                                                Started having symptoms about 26-30 hours after vaccine, headache, nausea, vomiting and hives to my chest and arms.  The following day hives increased to chest, armpits and abdomen - went to be evaluated., was having allergic reaction.  Was given Solumedrol IM injection and Rx for prednisone dose pack and Claritin, also told to take Benadryl.   The following evening hives  increased to chest, abdomen, back, arms neck and hairline.  Called in to work the next day and instructed to continue Rx treatment of prednisone, Claritin and to take Benadryl every 6 hours and advised to not get second injection.  Took mediations as prescribed at home but hives continued to spread with some mild swelling to eyes, face and lips.  By Sunday hives had improved to my chest, and and legs but started moving to my feet. Monday hives had improved by  about 50 percent, did call in to work and continue take Rx?s with Benadryl every 6 hours.  On Tuesday, most all hives had disappeared, except to lower legs and feet. Hives completely gone on Thursday.

She remained itchy for several days, but it would come and go.  About two weeks after the shot; she started to break out into hives on her arms, then spread to her legs, back and head.  Her palms got red.   She took claritin and it gave her short-lived relief.  She got prescribed a medrol dose pack, she completed two packs and still no relief.  It helped while she was on it then symptoms came back once she stopped.  She has an itchy throat, swollen face.  She also has diarrhea.  Symptoms have no been for over a month and seem to be getting worse.  Following up with an allergist and her PCP today.   Dr. then prescribed Solu Medrol, IV which she had last week. While, she was receiving the treatment, she felt better.   As soon as the IV was done. She started to break out again.  Today she came into work, and her eyes were blood shot. She also has pressure in her chest and has a hard time swallowing.  She had hives on the inside of the mouth, and alongside her tongue.    She will be seeing an allergist and an infectious disease in the upcoming days.

From the first vaccine had a sore arm, but one noticeable small lymph node in clavicle,. no pain.   She then had this area react again, had swollen lymph nodes in clavicle and the entire area lit up in the neck and cheek area.  She then went and did a CT scan and showed multiple lymph nodes.  There was pulling of the face and neck.  The swelling has caused the muscles to contract due to the pain.  She does not have any droopiness, but it&#39;s hard for her to smile.  They have taken her off of work, put her on muscle relaxants and to have more blood work done on Friday, tomorrow and return to the doctor on Tuesday.

At that point she was transported to the ED for further evaluation.  She denies any known reaction to any food, medication, or additives.

                                                3 days after vaccine (2/5/21): mild fever (normally 96.5 - consistent temp over the course of several months on two different thermometers, was 98), worsening of sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, chills/feverish feeling. Negative strep that day, negative covid test the following Monday. Resolved within 48 hours.  8 days after vaccine (2/10/21): developed rash at injection site, tenderness, swelling, and itching - right arm had very minimal, minor rash at the same time. Pain was more significant than the two days post injection and improved within 48 hours (still have itchy, dry, raised skin but minimal redness as of 2/22/21).  16 days after vaccine (2/18/21): lymph node in front of neck area by collarbone swollen. No pain but minor discomfort. It feels like a 2 inch squishy mass with a hard node in it. I&#39;ve never had swelling here before. If my other lymph nodes are swollen as well I cannot tell.  I had the flu shot at the end of December, 2020. Not sure if that was close enough to matter, no symptoms after that one.

While taking PIO I had swelling and lumps at the injection sites which dissipated over time. Following the 2nd Moderna vaccine, the swelling and lumps reappeared. I believe this is related to the vaccine, as clinical trial participants with dermal facial fillers had similar immunological reactions.

                                                My armed burned when I got shot for about 5 minutes. I got the shot at 2pm on Monday. Monday night my arm was red and sore but nothing worth worrying about. Tuesday morning, I woke up with a very red, swollen, tender arm that was hot to touch. I also felt tired and generally not well. I knew these were symptoms that were common. By Tuesday night, the symptoms on my arm were getting worse. I was in pain and the redness was growing. By Wednesday morning it was the size of my open hand. I went to the doctor and they suggested putting ice on it and taking Tylenol. It should go away in a few days. By Wednesday night, it was extremely red and growing. It is now Thursday night, the redness, swelling and pain are going down, especially in the middle. The outer areas are still very red. The pain comes and go. It is not as hot. I get headaches on and off.

I took Benadryl and Pepcid an hour before getting vaccinated to try to prevent an allergic reaction but my face still swelled. I took Benadryl and steroids for the next week to reduce the swelling.

Patch was red scaly with raised edges and itchy. 14 days later small flat oval spots appeared on stomach and back. Itchy red scaly. By Feb 18, I stared to get concerned and took pictures. I recorded 62 spots on my trunk. These continued to grow, itch, spread across my torso. Some are small red spots and others are flat oval scaly shaped. Itch more with exercise or after a shower.  By March 4th, I went to my pcp. With out a throughout examine or listening to my time line she just said hives and gave me prednisone. The spots continue to grow but are seeming to fade in color slightly. I started taking acyclovir for a unrelated fever blister as well. I believe it is Pityriasis rosea given the symptoms ans timeline but I am concerned it may be related to either a case of covid or from receiving the vaccine

Took OTC Tylenol (2) po and had no signs of relief. Pain , swelling, and skin redness lasted for 3 days. On February 10th, 2021 I had a positive pregnancy test (confirmed by bloodwork and urine) which indicated I was 6-7 weeks pregnant and had a miscarriage on March 2021, after giving live births 3 prior times. The cause of the miscarriage is unknown.  I also developed a blood clot on the arm that was inserted for an IV. I have no family history or personal history of needing blood thinners.

                                                9 days after the vaccine I experienced a swollen red lymph node in my left armpit. (site arm) The node continued to swell and be tender until it was the size of a ping pong ball. 33 days after the injection it broke open and tan-ish bloody fluid came out. The doctor instructed if the pain was feeling better continue to clean it and monitor. It appears to be healing but as of right now I still have a red enlarged area under my armpit and it has been 38 days since my vaccine.

The lymph nodes became swollen from the first dose and had been getting smaller, but they became larger within 24 hours of the second dose.  I first took Tylenol for the pain and felt no relief.  At 7:00 am on the 3/16 I took Ibuprofen and felt relief from pain and fever within a couple of hours.  I took two more doses of Ibuprofen that day.  All symptoms but swollen lymph nodes have resolved on 3/17.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

Very tired all week post vaccine,.  Day 5-6 noticed ipsilateral axillary lymph node swelling.  On day 7 post vaccine I got a localized area of itching swelling and redness as if I had been bitten by a few mosquitoes at injection site that was new. Milder on day 8, less itchy and swollen, but still red and a little raised.  Mild shortness of breath.

                                                4 days after injection: Soreness in arm, swollen and painful lymph node in armpit until evening  of 1/6/21.  1/5/21 (1 week after injection), 5pm: swelling,  redness, burning, hardened tissue around injection site on left shoulder. 1/6/21: Worsened swelling, redness, hardened tissue which continued to cover upper arm. Turned into hives (first time ever having that kind of allergic reaction).  Took a Benedryl before bed. 1/7/21: symptoms improved by at least 50%. Much less pain in armpit. Redness and some tenderness still present in left shoulder. Another Benedryl taken this morning.

                                                Patient reported swelling of arm several hours after vaccination that resolved the following day after taking diphenhydramine and applying hydrocortisone. The swelling returned after 3 days and has progressively become worse since the time of vaccination. She appears to have cellulitis, and this may be a result of the vaccinator using a 1 inch needle to administer the vaccine vs. a 1&amp;1/2 inch needle. This patient&#39;s weight is greater than 200 lbs and if a 1 inch needle was used this vaccine would have been administered subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly.

My provider initially treated me with Keflex and told me I had cellulitis caused by the vaccine. I took the antibiotics (500mg x 3 per day) for 5 days and the area got much worse. I went back to the doctor and was told it was actually an allergic reaction. I was treated with Prednisone and Benadryl for 7 days. The area cleared up after that treatment, but is still slightly discolored.

Bull&#39;s eye Rash on the vaccine site. I have taken a photo if ever needed. 2. Swollen lymph nodes.  I wanted to emphasize on the bull&#39;s eye rash which started after 5 days after vaccination. it&#39;s itchy and swollen. No pain or other discomfort.  I never noticed lymph nodes  before the peculiar rash.  I am overall health and has no other contra indications.

                                                I received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA on the morning of 1/14/21. The next morning when I woke up I noticed that my right jaw was sore. I thought I may have slept on it wrong during my sleep or that had chewed weird while eating the day before and didn&#39;t think much of it. Throughout the day on 1/15/21 I continued to experience more pain though. I put some heat on it and tried to massage it, but nothing really helped. I hoped it would feel better this morning( 1/16/21) when I woke up but at this point it feels about the same. It&#39;s difficult to chew and feels swollen because my mouth bite isn&#39;t fully aligned like it usually is. I took my temperature and don&#39;t have a fever. I thought I should submit this in case my jaw pain it is related to getting the vaccine. In the past (maybe a year or so ago) I did have my chiropractor do some muscle release on the right side of my jaw because it was clicking a little while I ate and he said it was TMJ. I haven&#39;t experienced that since and this does not feel like that did, nor is there any clicking. Maybe that made me or susceptible though to experience this side effect if that&#39;s what it is so wanted to include that too.

Day 3---no side effects Day 4 to Day 5---At about 8 pm, I noticed slight swelling underneath my left eye, that looked like a bag.  My face was also red.  The sides of my face, jaw line,  &amp; both sides of my neck were itchy.  I went to bed since I was supposed to work the next morning at 6 AM (OB Nurse).  I work up at 4:15 AM &amp; my face was quite swollen, specifically my left side, my face &amp; neck was warm to the touch &amp;  itchy.  I immediately took 50mg of Benadryl &amp; called my internal medicine doctor. Day 5---I was to be seen in the clinic at 7:00 AM.  The Benadryl helped some.  I was not having any breathing difficulty.  I was prescribed 5 days of Prednisone.  By about 1:00 PM,  the swelling was worsening &amp; my lips were tingling.  I called the doctor again &amp; they told me to go to the ER.  I never had issues with my airway.   The swelling was always worse on my left side of my face.  I received IV fluids &amp; Solumedrol &amp; was discharged with an epi pen, &amp; told to continue the Benadryl, Prednisone, &amp; Pepcid bid.  CoVid test done in ER was negative. Day 6---The facial swelling/redness/itching remained but was improved.  I was very tired. Day 7---Same as Day 6, but less swelling. Day 8---Facial swelling/redness/itching gone, but tiredness remained.  Started to notice a chest heaviness/feeling of constant excitement in the center of my chest, even when at rest. Day 9-10---Tiredness remained.  Intermittent Chest heaviness/feeling of excitement in the center of my chest remained. Day 11---Feeling more normal.

I did not immediately notify anyone as I was not aware a fast heartbeat was considered an allergic reaction.  The fast heartbeat resolved, but my heartbeat continued to be elevated about 10-20bpm from my usual baselines for 2 days post vaccine.  I also developed the following side effects; headache, fatigue, muscle/joint pain, chills, swelling of lymph nodes on right arm, pain on right arm/joints, and mild tingling/numbness of right arm; all side effects resolved by day 3 post vaccine.

                                                6 days post vaccine small circular rash appeared approximately 2-3cm below injection site. Following day rash was bigger and now solid, hot to touch and itchy. Over the course 6 days the rash has continued to spread down and up my arm in a circular shape. Lymph node located in my armpit also became swollen a day after the rash appeared.  I saw the doctor on the 4th day after the rash had appeared. That doctor consulted with dermatology and infectious disease. They are saying that it is a &#34;site&#34; related reaction. Recommendation for treatment is OTC allergy med, ibuprofen and ice.  I&#39;m 12 days post first vaccine and 6 days post start of rash and it&#39;s still ongoing.

                                                Moderna Vaccine. No immediate reaction. 1/13/21 I noticed there was still a sizable lump at the injection site. Called our Employee Health hotline and they advised to apply heat and massage the area. 1/14/21, I applied heat and massaged the area and within a few hours the injection site started to get red and increase in size, and my eyes began to itch and swell. Took a Benadryl and in the morning there was more swelling in my face. Went to the dr, they couldn&#39;t confirm if was or wasn&#39;t vaccine related, and advised to continue taking Benadryl and apply cool compress if arm was painful. Swelling continued on 1/15 and 1/16. Arm still has a large spot, it is less red in color now, there is still slight heat at the injection site. I have been taking at least 1 Benadryl for the last 7 days now.

                                                My cheeks and upper lip became swollen hours after having the vaccine. I had no other signs of an allergic reaction. In the past, I have had similar, but more severe, facial swelling that from antibiotics containing sulfonamide and fenugreek tea that also did not progress past facial swelling. I took Benadryl (two capsules). The swelling did not progress. They did have me wait 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine due to my history of allergic reactions to other things and nothing occurred during that time frame.  My cheeks and lip are still  very slightly swollen and I plan to take a second dose of Benadryl to make sure it completely dissipates.

Began about 18 hours after the injection. That is similar, but higher in intensity, that the response I experienced after my first COVID vaccination.

Pain and swelling in the lymph nodes began about 36 hours after the 2nd vaccination. It has not yet resolved.

There was bubbling under the skin at injection site.  Pain radiated to the underarm and lymph node of left arm. Hydrocortisone cream did not help. Mupirocin ointment, Benadryl cream, and oral antihistamines (Benadryl and Zyrtec) for the following 3 days helped clear much of the redness, itch, and warmth, Some redness, swelling, and minor bubbling are still present.

No relevant medical history and concomitant medications were reported.  On 08-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number: 011L20A) in the left non-dominant arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08-Jan-2020, the patient received vaccine, which was of lack of correct administration as it was injected in the fat and not in the muscle and injection which was appears to be lower than where normally given. On the same date, after administration of vaccine, the patient had experienced swollen arm (swelling), hives on the back, 2.5in red circle, didn&#39;t feel good, was tired and couldn&#39;t process things well. On 18-Jan-2021, 10 days after the administration of vaccine, the patient had developed very large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle and was hot to the touch. Treatment for the event included paracetamol (acetaminophen) and loratadine.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not provided.   The outcome of events didn&#39;t feel good, hot to the touch, hives on the back, tired and very large, red (2.5/3in circle) allergic reaction at the injection site was unknown. The event lack of correct administration, injection appears to be lower than where normally given, was injected in the fat and not in the muscle was considered to be resolved on 08-Jan-2021. The event swollen arm/hardness was considered to be resolved on 09-Jan-2021. The event couldn&#39;t process things well was considered to be resolved on 15-Jan-2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of a 37-year-old female patient who experienced non-serious events of lack of correct administration/injection appears to be lower than where normally given/was injected in the fat and not in the muscle ( inappropriate route of vaccine administered), didn&#39;t feel good, couldn&#39;t process things well, hot to the touch, hives on the back, swollen arm/hardness, tired and very large, red (2.5/3in circle) allergic reaction at the injection site..  All events excluding (large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle hot to the touch) developed on the same day after the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (lot # 011L20A, expiration date-unknown). The event of large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle which was hot to the touch developed 10 days after the vaccine administration. Based on the information provided which includes a temporal association, a causal association between the administration of the vaccine and the other reported events cannot be excluded. Tiredness, redness and hives are consistent with the safety profile of the vaccine. The event of inappropriate route of vaccine administered is considered not applicable.

                                                The HCW noted w/i 1 hr of vaccination a constellation of symptoms including dizziness, disorientation, and fatigue; and by 4 hrs she developed swelling LUE with pain and some swelling extending to the L neck.  Over the next several days she reported marked swelling and tenderness over the triceps upper arm area; persistent swelling and pain in the neck that required cold packs for a couple days.  The reaction appeared to be more pronounced and extensive akin to the Humira local reaction she would ordinarily get; the last dose of that was 4 months prior.  By history, it sounds like extensive angioedema.  At no point was there any pruritus, erythema, or hive or rash on any other part of the body; no respiratory compromise, stridor or wheeze; and no fever.  Symptoms subsided over several days and she was well on day of her presenting for her second vaccination.  The vaccinator (who is a pediatrician), an on-call allergist; and this reporter (a medical oncologist) all consulted on best approach.  The allergist recommends skin testing; Humira may have a polysorbate component; and we collectively thought a contraindication to proceeding.  Given the deliberation the HCW actually elected also not to proceed.  We informed her that early data suggests one dose of the Moderna vaccine may confer an approximate 80% protection.  She will present to EHS for further evaluation.

                                                Within about 30 mins my arm started swelling and became very itchy at the injection site.  I was advised to take benadryl, but I&#39;ve had a bad response to benadryl in the past so I didn&#39;t want to take it. 2 hours later, a swollen rash the size of an inch began to develop. I felt very tired and went to bed early. By the next morning the rash was still swollen and painful and doubled in size. Today, day 3, the hot and swollen rash is 4 inches in size. I also have chills, diarrhea and fatigue. My arm feels weak and sore in the bone (if that makes sense). I&#39;m not sure if this is the worse of it. I consulted a telemedicine dr and was advised to wait it out. I have documented with photos.

The neck stiffness is there, but improving.

                                                I got the vaccine on 30th of Dec. Had a sore arm, runny nose, woke up the next day to puffy eyes and bruises under my eyes (still hasn&#39;t gone away) Since then I have had GI issues. Constipation. It aggravated my face. I had nausea. I had a rash on my arm and on my chest the following Tuesday. My face were tingling and very flush. I had a lot of allergy and sinus issues. Sinus pressure. This all unfolded the first few weeks after receiving the vaccine. I do have fibromyalgia. I had allergy testing done. I am allergic to bee stings. Was having a lot of vaginal issues. Watery eyes and have hot flashes followed by chills. Hives on chest. Difficulty swallowing. Rapid heart rate. I have seen three doctors that have told me my hear rate was fast. Glands have been swollen for two weeks. The night after I got the shot it was really rough with body aches.

Swollen lymph nodes on my armpit and a weakness feeling on the right side(arm and leg).

She was pretty much herself on morning of 2/13/2021 - got up, had shower.  caregivers noted her extremities were cool and face was red.  temp was 97.4.  She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.  CPR was continued until family could be reached and decision was made to stop resuscitation.

By 12pm my arm was swollen, red and hurt to move. That evening I woke up and vomited, had a fever of 100.6 and my body hurt like I had the flu. I slept all day Saturday and Sunday I woke up, my body pain was gone but my arm was red and swollen. Monday I went to work and had the APRN look at it as the redness was to my elbow and she diagnosed me with Cellulitis and treated me with 10 days of Doxycycline.

                                                4 days after injection soreness developed in my left armpit and soreness in left and right side of neck - where lymph nodes are.  5 days after soreness in lymph nodes in neck were gone. Tender and soreness in armpit continued. 6 days after noticed for the first time redness and skin slightly raised at injection site. No itching or burning which is why I didn&#39;t notice until I saw my arm in the mirror. Soreness and tenderness still in armpit.    My conclusion is that my lymph nodes are swollen and tender. There is no additional pain or discomfort.  Treatment - Massaging lymph nodes with hopes to helping them drain.

                                                Inner ear pain (outer ear does not hurt) in my right ear. I started feeling this pain about 2 weeks after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (I received the second dose in my right arm). It presents itself about 3 times a day, nothing ignites or lessens the pain, it feels like a sharp stabbing pain, intensity 4/10 and lasts less than a second. Also presenting itchiness inside the ear canal.  Additionally, swollen and painful to the touch axillary lymph nodes. I noticed them about 2 weeks after receiving the first and second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. They appeared on the same side of the vaccinated arm (i.e., left arm vaccinated, left axillary lymph nodes). They&#39;re sensitive to the touch, intensity 5/10. Did not take NSAIDs to reduce the pain (was afraid it might have been a breast lump, but ultrasound ruled it out and confirmed it was a swollen lymph node).

The red spots were not itchy, they were painful when pressure was applied.   The spots seemed to be swollen at the end of the day on 2/16/21.  I reached out to my doctor and saw her on 2/18/21 and the spots had cleared up.  My second dose was given on 2/20/21. I have felt similar pains in my earlier affected joints. The pain is not as bad, yet and there are no red spots.

                                                About 12 hours after my 2nd vaccination I developed a fever, chills and severe headache. This continued for 2 full days with fever breaking then coming right back, repeatedly, even with taking Tylenol every 6 hours. The headache was unbearable day 1 but mild day 2.  Fever got up to 102.4 at one point but was between 100-101 most of the time during those two days. I was not able to function or get off the couch at all day 1 and at about 50% day 2. By day 3 post vaccination I felt completely back to normal besides a very sore and swollen arm still. This continued for about 6 days post shot.

As the day wore on the bump became larger and softer and the soft tissue above my collarbone swelled. By the evening of 3/7, my swollen lymph node began to drain into my armpit, and those lymph nodes became swollen. they both remain swollen and very tender for about 48 hours.   Then on 3/9, I developed a welt-like red spot on the top of my left shoulder. It persisted until 3/12. It was about 3 inches long by 1.5 inches wide, with a darker red outline. It was not sensitive or tender to the touch.  As of today, 3/12, I still have a small, hard lump on my left collarbone, but it is no longer swollen or tender.

                                                I had what urgent care told me was hives.  The hives were very large and unlike any hives I had ever had.  They covered my neck, went onto my back, chest and stomach.  On my neck they were very large, covering over half my neck for just one, raised, hot to touch, and the color of what i would describe as port wine.  I was prescribed benadryl and prednisone.  I only took benadryl.  I took 3 tablets right away and also the benadryl cream i applied to all the hives.  It took about 24 hours for the hives to completely disappear.

The next day, it had grown to be 3 inches in diameter and it was red and swollen. and I called the doctor at that point. Doctor said it should be fine but then it got a little itchy and it went away about five days. I get migraines anyway but I started having migraines  - had a migraine for about two weeks solid- from the time I had the first shot, I am still fighting them. Got put on another medicine for migraines but I think it was after my second shot. It was for high blood pressure - the vaccine may have increased the blood pressure - thinking that the blood pressure and migraines are connected. Was still getting headaches (increased) before the second dose but everything else had resolved.

I got under the covers. It hit 99.9 (fever). I slept hard for most of weekend. Arm was really itchy - I had swelling again. I didn&#39;t see a doctor. A couple of days after I got my shot - stomach issues, diarrhea, flu, body aches - those lasted a couple of days by Tuesday. Except the stomach pain lasted about a week. High blood pressure and migraines was having these too. Have struggled with heart palpitations and insomnia at night because blood oxygen level at night is in the low 90&#39;s. Doctor has said to wait a little longer to see if goes away. Metropole - or Toprol was added either right before the second dose or right after second dose of vaccine. Migraines and sleep issues are still an issue - as well as the low blood oxygen level. The symptoms that are typical vaccine related side affects have resolved.

                                                A sore left underarm (armpit) - noticeably larger than the right (inflamed). Could feel and see the lymph node. Also, on the left side - the lymph node on the base of my neck - between neck and collarbone was significantly large and inflamed. Nothing on right side (all on the left side.) That subsided in about a week and a half - the armpit one. The one in the neck lasted about 2 weeks. The other thing I noticed was sciatica pain  (both sides) (within a week of the vaccine)- I&#39;ve never had this before. And I noticed hip pain/tightness of the right side  (I noticed this pain after the second vaccine)- if I sit with my legs crossed,  or sit with one leg underneath, I can only do that a minute or two without  it being really uncomfortable. I had a doctor visit for the swollen lymph node on January 19th. She just did an exam and asked me if I had my vaccine and told me it was a side affect of vaccine.  Have not recovered from the hip pain and sciatica pain yet and that is intermittent. Have recovered from the lymph nodes swollen.

Progressively, left arm became red, warm to touch, hard, swollen, itchy and painful through the course of the day. It spread rapidly and pain was radiating under left breast, where the lymph nodes are located, behind back/shoulder. The following  day it has spread even further,  down to elbow; numbing/tingling sensation radiating to left pinkie and left ring fingers.   Vital signs: higher than normal systolic BP 130-150s (normal for me:100-110s); tachycardic with HR in 130-140s on the first day of the adverse event, O2 sats normal high 90s to 100% on RA.

That night the swelling mover to the center of my face (mainly my bottom lip and some of my chin). Day 2 the swelling was most severe and moved to my right cheek and lip. The swelling was less the night of day 2 and even better the morning of day 3 after starting oral prednisone . Today on day four I am Almost back to normal but still some puffiness in both cheeks and bottom lip.  Per my physicians advice I will be on a 5day course of oral prednisone (10mg 2x/day)  The other adverse event I experienced was starting day 2 I had extreme pain and itching as well as some cyst like bumps on both my feet as well as very mild itching on my palms.They are improving on day 4 but still super itchy. I have been advised to take Benadryl as needed for that.

                                                I received Moderna  #037K20A COVID 19 vaccine yesterday and 3 hrs after that I developed tingling and numbness in my arm. I then developed a swelling and intense pain. There is area of induration and erythema around the vaccine injection site.  I have been using Ibuprofen every 6 hrs for pain and applying ice pack which is helping some with pain.

                                                I was given the Covid Vaccine in my left deltoid on a Saturday morning. I developed severe heartburn/indigestion that day but was unsure if symptoms were related to vaccine. My arm was sore for about 3 days after injection which was a common side effect. After that, my arm felt completely fine although I continued to experience severe heartburn. I made an appointment to see my PCP that following Thursday for the heartburn and he ordered a CT Angiogram to r/o thoracic aneurysm. During the imaging test the nurse injected contrast dye into an IV in my left AC, below the site of my Covid vaccine injection 5 days prior.  That night I began feeling pain in my arm and noticed that my lymph node in my left axilla had become swollen. I ignored the symptom, assuming that it was yet another symptom of the vaccine. 3 days later on Sunday evening (8 days after my initial covid vaccine injection), I noticed that my shoulder on and around the vaccine injection site  was  swollen, very warm to touch and was extremely tender and itchy. I immediately called my PCP. The next day (today), on Monday afternoon. A fine red rash has developed.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

I was told to consult with my PCP but he doesn&#39;t know because &#34;we  use Pfizer here, not Moderna. Follow the website link.&#34; The site where the vaccine was given looks like my skin is discolor now -turning brown like leaving a mark around the lump (birth mark look like).

Yesterday, 1/14/21(9days after receiving the vaccine), I noticed that my arm was itching where I received the vaccine and when I looked it was all red and swollen. Not having any pain and have had no other reactions to the vaccine. I am scheduled February 2nd for my 2nd vaccine. Will it be okay to receive it?

Since administration of the vaccine, one week ago, I have had a lump at the injection site. Yesterday, I noticed pain in my axillary region and noted a very enlarged (approximately the size of a cherry) and tender lymph node along with other smaller, nontender, lymph nodes. I have other enlarged, mildly tender,  lymph nodes in the area of my clavicle as well. These lymph nodes are ipsilateral to the injection site.

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was dizzy. I sat down where they had us wait and the dizziness wouldn&#39;t go away. Became difficult to swallow - felt like a lump in my throat. More difficult to breathe then normal. Vitals taken. BP taken. Feeling like I had an epidural. Legs had a sensation like they were going numb and then they went numb. Benadryl injection given. Legs felt like they fell asleep. Waited and within second 30 min timeframe I was feeling a lot better so I left. 2:30 in the morning, my legs were asleep again and the lump came back in my throat and took Benadryl and it went away and I felt fine. I went to work the next day. At 7:00 that evening felt chilled and it came and went. I came up and took more Benadryl and rested.I went to work the next day and I sent a message to my Primary Care DR. - but leg was fine and the lump in throat wasn&#39;t there. On Saturday morning - after 10 days - had a headache that would not go away  (Very severe headache)- took Tylenol 1000 mg it didn&#39;t work. It was very bad Saturday night I took another Tylenol 1000 and Sunday morning it - headache still wasn&#39;t gone. Leg was numb again. This time the leg  numbness was worse than ever had felt. Left axilla - there was a lump/nodule and it was painful. Tried TeleHealth Med and they recommended I go to ER but I didn&#39;t feel good enough to do it. Dr.  I reached out to her and she took the history and she prescribed Prednisone; but wanted me to do a COVID test and Urine sample to see how I was doing before I took the medication so I did it next the day. Urine sample was clean. Prednisone 60 for four days 40 for four days and 20 for four days - On day Prednisone my legs feel fine, but the headache just lingers. On day two of Prednisone she told me to stop the Benadryl. Three days after Prednisone the lump under axilla resolved. I am taking coffee. Headache is still there but not as severe.

                                                5 days following vaccination I woke up with severe itching and hives, redness and swelling all over my body. I took a Zyrtec pill and it helped. Went a day with no further reaction then the next day I woke early 2 -3 a.m. with severe redness, swelling, and itching which started in hands and arms the spread throughout the day to my entire body. Ended up with hives on lips and face with swelling as well. Went to NP was given Kenalog shot and took zyrtec as well as 25mg Benadryl. This calmed things down. However have had to continue taking zyrtec and Benadryl to control symptoms at this time.

The day following also was tired achy and felt off/headache. On Thursday symptoms went away other than the arm and a slight headache. On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

Saturday morning - fever down to 99.9; joint pain and body aches still there. Yesterday (the31st) I had low grade fever in the morning - 99.3 and some body aches and I took Tylenol (started taking this yesterday, 31st). Today, Feb 1, 2021, I have swelling and redness in my arm. Not right on the vaccine site - it&#39;s a bit lower and it&#39;s warm at touch. It hurts where the redness where it feels hot (not at the vaccine site). I am still using the arm but it does hurt to try to lift it.  The body aches and joint pain have gone and I haven&#39;t felt like I have a fever today.

After about an hour, my arm was swollen and very painful to move and touch. I put an ice pack on and took Tylenol but the pain and swelling didn?t completely subside. I went to bed with Tylenol PM to help me sleep and woke up several times from the pain. Throughout the day today (2nd day), the pain has steadily gotten worse. I can barely move my arm due to the immense pain. The swelling is still there. I have been icing it and taking Tylenol but the pain has only gotten worse. I feel achy in my neck and the pain is radiating down my arm to my forearm, wrist, and fingers.

                                                Hard lump at injection site first noticed at about 5pm on 1/15/21, only the size of a finger tip. It grew to a large oval 2.5 to 3 inches across, that was hard an painful within 3 hours. It also became redder, darker, and itchier as it grew. A health professional was contacted to discuss need for treatment. He had been concerned that it may be an infection as he thought it was too long since the injection to be a site reaction. Patient was seen that night &amp; told it was an adverse reaction. The lump grew over the next 3 days. On 1/20/21, patient noticed that the &#34;lump&#34; area was softer and faded, but now had a darker pink circle around it that was raised and hard, about 2-3 cm wide. This took over a week to fade. Patient spoke to another ED provider on 1/20/21, and was told it had been an &#34;arthus reaction&#34; to the vaccination.

                                                4 days post covid vaccine dose 1 I developed pain and lymphadenopathy in my right axilla (the arm the received the injection). 2 days later (6 days post vaccine) I developed an itchy area around the vaccine site, redness (approximately 3 in x 3 in), intense pain, and swelling. I was concerned this was a cellulitis vs delayed vaccine reaction and kept an eye on the area.  I consulted a MD I work with who stated to keep an eye on the site. Symptoms began to subside 2 days later but it wasn&#39;t fully resolved until approximately 10-11 days post injection.

Patient&#39;s arm that received the vaccine had severe swelling and redness around the inject site and spread in circular motion. Muscle on and around the injection site felt hard, warm and pain. The redness started to diffuse in circular motion at approximately 2pm  in the afternoon. Pt took Tylenol 325mg x 1 dose on 1/21/21 at 7am. Patient also massaged her arm to help with pain. Pt stated the night before the swelling and redness she felt tingling around the injection site all night. Patient stated symptoms went away approximately 2 days after the onset of symptoms.

                                                Swollen axillary lymph node on the same side of injection site (left arm), which was observed 5 days after the vaccination was given and accompanied by moderate pain upon contact.  PCP was seen 12 days after receiving the vaccine as the size of the axillary bump was not decreasing.  Continued monitoring and warm wet compresses were recommended to rule out possible cyst.  The axillary bump increased in size again about 15 days out from vaccination before noticeably getting smaller 3 days later.  It was determined to be a swollen lymph node the next day at the follow-up appointment and continues to decrease in size.  Other symptoms that were experienced were hot flashes within 45 minutes of vaccination that lasted for a couple of hours and nausea the following morning.

The next day her gums felt swollen and painful, temperature was again 101 and her hands felt swollen. She also experienced fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and loss of taste. The following day on Sunday, she continued to have body aches, dyspnea on exertion and fatigue and hand swelling but also developed a slight sore throat, a slight runny nose and a headache. This was the worst day of symptoms. On Monday she continued with difficulty swallowing, bodyaches, dyspnea on exertion, temperature 101, headache, sore throat, fatigue, loss of taste. The runny nose had resolved and she was feeling slightly better.  On Tuesday she continued to improve. Temperature was down to 99.  The remainder of symptoms took to approx. 6-7 days to resolve.

                                                Moderna shot #2: About 6-8 hours in, I got the expected serious joint aches, chills, headache, and fever (101F). This lasted for about 2 days, managed well by alternating Motrin and Tylenol. A mild rash occurred a few days after shot #2.   Thought I was done since most of my colleagues bounced back after 2-3 days. Then 48 hours in, I developed a racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools. No position or relaxation method would resolve these symptoms. All I could do was lie down perfectly still with an ice pack on my forehead and hope this was short-lived and would pass. I could not sleep. I had no appetite. Over the 8 days this has been occurring, I lost 3 pounds.  I could not find any literature of anyone else having any cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. It scared me. I have no prior cardiac history and no history of anxiety. I went to the ER. Labwork showed an elevated D-dimer (luckily the CT scan showed NO blood clots), elevated WBC/neutrophils, and low potassium. Thyroid labs (which I had tested a few days later) were normal. The ER assumed the abnormal labs were due to the immune response to the vaccine and referred me to a cardiologist.   I did a virtual visit with the cardiologist the next day. He suggested a heart monitor and scheduling an echo. The heart monitor was mailed to me. I started wearing it on 2/4/21 (3 days ago). I am supposed to wear it for 7 days and then mail it back. My echo is scheduled for 3/4/21. Again, I have had no previous cardiac history. I am an active, healthy 38 y/o F.   These symptoms (racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools) have continued to last for another 8 days and are debilitating. I have not been able to work.   On day 7 of these symptoms, I called my PCP?s emergency line. They suggested calling the cardiologist to see if they would consider prescribing a beta blocker for symptomatic relief. I called the cardiologist last night. They prescribed Metoprolol. I haven?t taken it yet. It?s officially day 8. I thought I was in the clear and had not had symptoms since last night, but then just now another episode of these cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms have occurred but less intense than previously.   At this point, I have had had 10 days of symptoms post Moderna vaccine #2 but 8 of those days are specifally the cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. Although a little better, these symptoms have NOT resolved and continue.  I realize I am probably an outlier in terms of how I have reacted to this vaccine. I would love a call back to know if other people have had a similar experience, so I can understand if this is ?normal.? I understand 7% of patients in the Moderna vaccine trial had ?symptoms? lasting longer than 7 days. Were they symptoms similar to mine? Will this go away completely? Any help is appreciated.   Of note, I did develop a nice rash below my injection site on Moderna shot #1. Does that mean I?m more ?reactogenic? and would potentially have a harder time with shot #2? Does size matter in how you will react? Moderna is 100 mcg (instead of Pfizer?s 30 mcg) I am petite (5?2? and am now 106 lbs since I?ve lost weight).

On 2/7 my arm again swelled, became painful, hot to the touch and developed a elevated patch well away from the injection site. As of today it is still present. It will recede and then flare back up.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:25 pm on Saturday Feb 13th. I woke up early Sunday unable to sleep due to all over body aches and joint pain. I did not have a fever at any point. I had chills off and on, but mostly horrible body aches everywhere. My left arm was also extremely sore. I knew this was all normal so I was not at all worried. Then Sunday evening my right knee started aching more than the rest of my body and started swelling. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. When I woke up Monday morning it was severely swollen and bright red and heat was radiating  from it.  I had to take a day off of work because I stand at work and it was making it much worse. So I iced it and elevated it and took ibuprofen, but it remained swollen and red and very painful. I was unable to bend the knee and couldn&#39;t crouch down or bend the knee to sit.  On Wednesday morning I went to my doctor at the clinic on the advice or a friend that is a nurse and a friend that is a pharmacist. See below (item 19) for what was prescribed. This took away the severe swelling within about a day and a half, but it&#39;s still painful and achy and hurts to bend. There is also still a bump on the top of my knee.  The all over body aches and joint pain lasted until about Friday the 19th . I have photos of my knee if you would like them.

                                                I received the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 01:49 pm. Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for a health checker and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on a health checker under ?other&#39;&#39; multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud&#39;s Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series. On 2/3/2021 at approximately 1:45 pm, I received the second Moderna Covid-19 vaccination.  On 2//10/2021, small red, itchy bumps started to appear on both sides of my neck. On 2/15/2021, a bump appeared above my right eyebrow with what felt like a pimple. On 2/21/2021, the ?pimple? had spread towards my inner eye and above my right eyebrow making my right eyelid swell. I received telemedicine care via an e-visit over telehealth with an urgent care and was provided an antibiotic for facial cellulitis. On 2/22/2021, I had one episode of emesis, and went in person to an urgent care. I received a different prescription of an antibiotic, and was provided with instructions of signs and symptoms of what to look for when to report to the emergency room. On 2/25/2021, my right eye started tearing up and the pain began to intensify. I was provided medical care by a Neuro-ophthalmologist and given a primary diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Presently, I have multiple areas of herpes zoster appearing on various areas of my head, shoulder, and chest that do not follow specific dermatomes.

While I was there, I was given Tramodal of pain observed for several hours then told that my impending facial paralysis was just a allergic reaction to the shot, to take Tylenol and Motrin for pain. For 2 more days my face continued to swell and I suffered in pain , I went back to the urgent care , where I was provided something for the ?supposed allergic reaction? pain and to help with the swelling, well a few days  the new meds t last Thursday my mouth gushed with this fluid of Blood and puss mixed , very thick. I went back to the urgent care and they could not tell if this was coming from my jaw or my gum( also I have braces only on my top teeth and I went to the orthodontist the same day I received the shot, I go every for weeks) I was given more meds to take with the ones that I was already prescribed and told to contact my orthodontist because even though my face has gone down I have a hard knot in it that possibly holds infection.

It was negative. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine.

Skin was swollen and raised largely in an approximate 3-in ring around the injection site, with a few raised areas outside of the ring. Minimal itching and discomfort. Two 25mg capsules of antihistamine resulted in the elimination of the raised areas and reduced swelling in about 24-hours

I could not go to work that day because I felt so ill. At 7 days after vaccine I developed a small rash on right arm. It is around and to the side of vaccine site. Over the last few days it has grown bigger. It is hot to the touch and is painful. I also have lymph nodes that are enlarged under armpit.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I am experiencing intense itching and rash on torso, legs, neck, and scalp. The rash is maculopapular, but sometimes becomes inflamed and looks similar to hives. It is hot to the touch and very itchy--both of these symptoms are more intense at night. I have also observed chilblains are appearing on my fingers.  I regularly experienced chilblains from 2004-2010, but have had none since until now.  I also experienced chills, night sweats, and swollen lymph nodes. I attempted to treat the rash with triamcinolone acetone 0.1%, which was prescribed for a similar condition in the past, and OTC antihistamines, both oral and topical.  I saw my dermatologist on 3/16, who advised me to continue triamcinolone and also gave me a 40mg steroid injection. She believes the rash may be a response to my vaccine. I unfortunately have not experienced much relief yet, and the rash and intense itching continue.  The chilblains, however, are clearing.

                                                Ten days after vaccination in the evening my arm was pink and itchy. The next morning it was very red, swollen and itchy. It was an area below the injection covering most of my arm to the elbow on the outside of my arm. It was swollen, hot and uncomfortable. I was prescribed antibiotics and an antihistamine. The doctor thought it was a delayed allergic reaction. I stopped the antibiotics after three days and used an antihistamine and steroid cream. It took a bout a week for it to clear up. I got the second shot in the same arm and pre-medicated with some antihistamine. I only had some mild redness for a day.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Rhinitis and Sinuplasty. Concomitant products included MACROGOL 3350 (MIRALAX), COLLAGEN, BIOTIN, KERATIN (BIOTIN PLUS KERATIN) and LINACLOTIDE (LINZESS) for an unknown indication.    On 14-Jan-2021 at 1:00 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 14-Jan-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DYSPHAGIA (inability to swallow), TACHYCARDIA (fast heartbeat), DIZZINESS (dizziness), TREMOR (shakiness) and FLUSHING (felt flushed). On 14-Jan-2021, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction), DYSPHAGIA (inability to swallow), TACHYCARDIA (fast heartbeat), DIZZINESS (dizziness), TREMOR (shakiness) and FLUSHING (felt flushed) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In January 2021, Blood pressure measurement: 106/71 (Inconclusive) 106/71. In January 2021, Body temperature: 98 (Inconclusive) 98 degree F. In January 2021, Heart rate: 87 (Inconclusive) 87bpm. In January 2021, Oxygen saturation: 98 % Inconclusive. In January 2021, Respiratory rate: 18 (Inconclusive) 18bpm.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosing was delayed on an unknown date.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment medication included epinephrine, IV steroid and IV diphenhydramine. She was taken to the emergency room and was treated for four hours and then discharged.

Pain was only in that associated armpit.  Pain lasted from 5/1/21 to 5/4/21  about the same time of day (noon).  Only other symptoms were hot flashes in the 2 days after receiving the vaccine.  Felt fine for a day then the armpit pain started.  It seems to be mostly gone by the one week mark.  Only a faint hint of soreness remains at this time.  I am a 38 year old female, not using hormonal birth control, reproductive organs are still functional/intact, no abnormal menstrual cycles prior to vaccine.  No issues with cycle to report at this time.

Updated my director of rehab of symptoms. Tried to report on V-safe however app does not allow for reporting past Day 7. Day 9 continued exhaustion, had to leave work early. Head felt in a fog, unable to focus.  Day 10 all symptoms gone.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

There&#39;s a bulge in my left armpit that&#39;s very painful; I also have pain in my shoulder blade and left upper side ribs. Not sure if it&#39;s just severe body aches or my ribs hurting. Yesterday, my tongue and throat started to hurt; I had a refill on the magic mouth wash prescribed; back when I had strep throat, so I&#39;ve been using that and taking Tylenol and using muscle rub, but nothing is helping.

Today 1/19 I woke with swollen tender glands in my axilla of the same arm.

                                                I had burning at the injection site immediately after receiving the vaccine. As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

THEY WOULD GO AWAY AND RETURN DAYS LATER ON OTHER PART OF THE MOUTH. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT 3 TIMES AND THE LAST TIME WAS ON TUESDAY 1/19/21 WHERE I DEVELOPED A HUGE PAINFUL LUMP UNDER MY JAW BY THE EVENING. I DON&#39;T USUALLY SUFFER FROM MOUTH BLISTERS. I HAVE ONLY DEVELOPED THEM 3 TO 5 TIMES IN MY ENTIRE LIFETIME. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY PRIMARY DOCTOR, WHO CONFIRMED THAT THE LUMP WAS A SWOLLEN LYMPH NODE, IT WAS HUGE, THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL. SHE DID A PHYSICAL ON ME TO CHECK IF I WAS SICK AND HAD NO OTHER SYMPTOMS ASIDE FROM THE MOUTH BLISTERS AND THE HUGE LYMPH NODE.

                                                Night of the vaccine, arm hurt at the injection site, very slight raised area about the size of my palm. I woke up with my left pointer finger and thumb side of my hand starting to swell.  Pain at the injection site (slight) when my arm is not in motion and when my arm is in motion. 9:45 am the swelling was continuing and I felt strange all over, head felt cloudy, so I took Benadryl. 10:27 am hand swelling is reduced, but head and body still feel strange. Some acid-reflux type feeling happening Generally feeling off today.

                                                Aside from a very sore left arm for two days after vaccination, a more serious symptoms began on Thursday morning around 6:00 am, January 28th 2020, and the lower right side of my face started swelling and numbness followed. Also I felt some pain and have lost movement on the right side of my face. It looks like I had a stroke. Upon research, I came across Bell&#39;s Palsy and its the closest description to what I am currently experiencing. In the last two days, the swelling has subside and it&#39;s a little bit better, however, my face is still compromised.

                                                The next two days I had a sore arm. But a week later, the following Monday and Tuesday, I had fatigue and headaches. I put the date as Wednesday because that is when the concerning possible reactions began. I woke with clogged ears feeling very sick. I took Advil Cold and Sinus and arranged to miss work. It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected. My ankles were also very tender as I had done a little jogging the day before and I normally walk. As the day progressed I was barely able to get out of bed. Sleeping and just laying there. My highest temperature was 101.25 at 2:45 pm. I had severe chills on and off. I reported these afflictions and was mailed a covid test by Thursday. The test came back negative by Friday evening. Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm. The oddness of that being where my shot was given is what makes me wonder if it was an extreme reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it is a flu. I have never had the body pains I try to describe before.

                                                Seven days after vaccine - I woke up and had excruciating pain in my left arm; a quarter size lump in armpit; other lymph nodes along breast as well. Red bullseye  showed up on vaccine site too. It really really hurt - pain was a 6 or 7. Couldn&#39;t wear a bra. Called employee health - they said to see how to goes. Blood blister on my finger - got that later. So they told me to see Primary care. She confirmed the swelling due to vaccine. Mammogram and ultra sound - two weeks later - they said they are very swollen - still aches under arm at this time. My lymph nodes are still swollen under my arm and under breast. Pain is at a 2 now. If I knick a node then it hurts bad but the pain has lessened.  Hemotologist; Dr - Primary; Radiologist and an Allergist all consulting with me right now. Had second dose of vaccine 2-3-2021 - have had lymph node swelling but not as bad - it wasn&#39;t extraordinary like first dose. Re-check will be April .

                                                Pt has h/o HTN (not on medication) and occasional asthma(no hospitalizations), and allergies to Penicillin (tongue swelling), tree nuts (throat swelling), and Bees (local swelling); Pt notes she only takes benadryl for these reactions; she has never been prescribed or used epinephrine. Pt denies heart disease, strokes, diabetes, increased bleeding tendency. No early heart disease in family. LMP in the last week. Pt notes she was supposed to see allergist in past, but has not. Pt was feeling well this morning before she came to COVID vaccine clinic. Pt had received first Moderna Vaccine shortly before 0918am here. At 0938 Pt noted feeling &#34;heaviness&#34; in head and &#34;lump in throat.&#34; Pt denied itching/swelling to mouth, itching/hives to body, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea. No lightheadedness/dizziness. Pt walked to stretcher. BP at right forearm was 223/151 and then 221/132 on repeat. Heartrate in 90s. Sao2 on RA 100%. RR 18. Pt notes having high BPs at times, but not often as high here. Pt speaking is slightly hoarse voice. No strider. Pt speaking in full sentences. No oropharyngeal edema. No urticaria. No tachypnea or wheeze. HRT RRR. 2&#43; left rad pulse.  A/P: given Pt&#39;s h/o severe allergies and now new Globus sensation and change to voice I discussed with Pt that she was likely having allergic reaction. Given involvement of airway I recommended epi administration to neutralize reaction and transfer to ED for observation. I advised Pt that epi would increase heartrate and blood pressure. I determined benefit of treating anaphylaxis outweighed risk of elevating BP, even though she has hypertensive urgency BP values. Pt has some headache; she could be bordering on hypertensive emergency. I asked pharmacist to call 911 indicating early anaphylaxis and request of paramedic.  ~5 minutes after Epi (given at 0942) Pt notes lump sensation and voice improved. I had RN place IV to left AC and gave verbal order for benadryl 25mg IV. Pt notes some nausea and dizziness. Lump sensation continues to improve. EMS arrived ~0950. I gave report to paramedic.  I discussed with Pt that I would place referral to Allergy and Immunology; they will determine if and when Pt could receive second moderna vaccine.

                                                Event: Allergic reaction on 3/24. The injection site began to itch around 9:30pm after taking a hot shower. Approximately 10 minutes later the injection site area swelled and became &#34;hard&#34; to the touch, then turn red, hot, and tender to the touch. The area affected was approximately 3 inches wide and 4 inches long - it covered the upper arm (deltoid muscle area). Within 5 minutes the itching sensation spread over the upper back on the left side and to the left side of my neck. Approximately 20 minutes later my bottom lip on the left-hand side swelled slightly and turned red and I had a slight difficulty swallowing. My breathing was not impeded. The reaction did not progress further (I had taken allergy medication to stop any further reaction). By 11pm the difficulty swallowing disappeared and the swelling in my lip reduced. By 5:30am I had no trouble with swallowing and there was no facial swelling. The swelling in my arm was reduced by half - although it was still warm, sensitive, and itched. Throughout the day (on 3/25) the swelling and redness at the injection site reduced. Two days after the start of the event, the area is still warm to the touch and will itch on occasion as will my lower left lip.  Treatment: as soon as I recognized it was an allergic reaction, when the area swelled, I took half a Wal-Zyr 10mg tablet (so I took 5mg of Walgreen&#39;s generic brand of Zyrtec) - approximately 9:45pm on 3/24. I took the other half (5mg) of the tablet at 5:30am the next morning on 3/25. No additional medication has been taken since.  Outcomes: The reaction was managed with the Wal-Zyr medication. Currently the injection area is slightly warm and itches on occasion, as does my lower left lip. There has been no change in this condition in the past 20 hours.

                                                11 days after receiving dose 2 of the Moderna COVID vaccine, I developed pain, redness, warmth, and swelling on the middle finger on my left hand (this was the arm in which I received the shot). I had an e-visit with a NP 2 days later, and was diagnosed with cellulitis in the finger and given antibiotics. I have never had cellulitis or any prior skin infection other than acne in puberty. Because of this, I am reporting the event in VAERS in case the data is helpful for others. Note: I previously entered a separate report for severe symptoms that occurred more quickly than this event).

                                                Immediately following the administration of the vaccine on Thursday, I tasted a metallic taste.  Within 5 mins I began to having a racing heart and flushed skin.  On my drive home approximately 15-20 minutes following the administration of the vaccine, I began feeling very flushed, continued racing heart, and had a lot of difficulty swallowing.  I tried to push water even though it was difficult to swallow.  Upon getting home I continued to feel these symptoms along with fatigue.  I laid down to rest after feeling extremely fatigued.  30 minutes later I woke up (this is approximately 1 hour - 1.5 hours after the vaccine administration) with a rash all over my chest, my neck and face.  Additionally, the left side of my neck was extremely swollen.  The lymph node on the left side was sticking out about the size of a golf ball.  I continued to have all these symptoms along with then extreme nausea, hot/cold flashes, and flu-like symptoms.   I took three Advil at this time.  These symptoms continued onto the morning (Friday).  In the morning, I still had the rash and swollen neck, so being worried, I took Benedryl and contacted my doctor and sent him pictures of my allergic reaction.  By Sunday, the swelling in my neck and other symptoms subsided.  The doctor returned my message on Monday and instructed me to report this via this form and advised me not to get the second shot, as it looks like  I had a severe allergic reaction to the first vaccine.  He advised me at that time that if I was still having symptoms I should go to the ER.  I no longer was having those symptoms, so I did not go to the ER immediately.

                                                Tired the first day of the shot, exercised to keep it moving but felt rundown. Arm hurt for a couple days after, like a normal shot, then went away. 1 week to the day I leaned on my arm and felt intense pain, looked down and it was very swollen with a red center. It?s hot to the touch, looks filled with fluid but also firm. Hurts to do anything with that arm and I am completely drained of energy. I?m about to fall asleep typing this.

                                                I am reporting this AE as the patient. I think I have what people have been calling &#34;vaccine arm.&#34; After 1 week after my injection, the injection site has become very swollen, large hard bump, and warm to touch. There is no rash. I have not treated this reaction yet (day 2 of the reaction) however plan to take Zyrtec to help with the swelling. I usually get this type of reaction after I get a bug bite but the symptoms post-vaccine injection are definitely more notable (i.e., more swollen, bigger bump) as compared to a bug bite. I also have swollen lymph nodes on the same side as the injection site (left side of my neck/shoulder).

A few days later symptoms were gone. Then a few days later, I noticed it was starting to itch sometimes again. I did not look at it at that time. I exercised the morning of 3/25 and afterward noticed that my arm basically looked like it did the day of the shot again - red, swollen, itchy, warm to the touch.  It measures 2  7/8 inches across and 1.5 inches top to bottom. No change in symptoms throughout the day. I contacted my primary care physician with pictures after reading about &#34;COVID arm&#34;

                                                One week after vaccination my arm started to itch. When I looked at it it was pink, about an inch around. Also at the same time the lymph node under my arm, on the same side as the vaccine site, started hurting. Over the next 24 hours the spot on my arm grew to about four inches around and got brighter red. It alternated between itching and burning, much of the time feeling like a sunburn. One day after it started I did an online doctor visit. She said it was most likely &#34;Covid arm&#34; and after reading about it online I agree.  Now almost 48 hours after symptoms started there is improvement, it has gone back to a dark pink. Lymph node still hurts but it has also improved.
