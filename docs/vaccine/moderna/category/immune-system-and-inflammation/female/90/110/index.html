                                                Caretaker at Facility contacted me to tell me that this morning, patients left arm is red and raised all the way to the elbow and very painful. Patient gets scheduled ibuprofen for arthritis which is helping.  She has had no other problems with other vaccinations including flu shot Fall 2020. Denies SOB, swollen tongue or throat, or rash/red areas anywhere else on body. Wondering if getting vaccine 3-1/2 months after getting COVID may be reason she is reacting. Caretaker anticipates she will recover just fine but is concerned about giving 2nd shot of series.

Face swollen to almost eye shut by Mar 1, very itchy and weepy. Rash also visible on neck and front of torso.               Visited doctors office on Mar 1 at 1:00pm.

                                                Patient was awakened by itchiness on left arm from elbow to wrist. Increased in severity to feeling as though on fire and being bitten by a thousand mosquitoes. Spread to other arm, both becoming bright red and blotchy. Some areas became raised. The itchy red began to creep up to injection site. Next day, February 21, legs began to ache, swell, and itch. Developed bright red, splotchy hives similar to arms spreading from knees to ankles before creeping up thighs. Large, hard, itchy area behind both ankles, and navel also became inflamed and itchy. Today (March 1) arms and legs are still red, though it has faded in some areas, and the itchiness is persistent but has subsided.

                                                My mom received her first Moderna Vaccine on 1/22/21. Late on 1/23 her face began to swell so the staff called the ambulance to come take her to the hospital for what they thought was an abscessed tooth. ER doctor said there was an infection and that she needed to be seen by an oral surgeon. On 1/25/21 I took my mom to Dr., her oral surgeon and after the examination he advised that there was no abscess but an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He suggested Benadryl. I gave her benadryl and the swelling started subsiding. From this point on her gums and teeth hurt. Her eating habits started to decline. She received her 2nd Moderna vaccine on 2/19/21 and from that point on she could no longer chew or brush her teeth because the pain was so severe. She passed on 3/19/21.

That reaction slowly went down and it&#39;s just above her elbow, she&#39;s 95 and it is kind of filled up with a hard mass in that area.  Her arm looks like a sunburn with two different shades of skin, on the back side of her arm where it is red.   She still has it on her arms today, 2/11/21.  She has not taken anything for it or put anything on it.  Her doctor told her to call us to see what we said she should do.  There is no pain, but it just looks bad and she is concerned.
