The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

                                                I filed the V-Safe for one week. Originally my arm was firm and red, and swollen...that went away in 2 days, and I felt fine. Oddly yesterday, my arm started another identical reaction from the vaccine, where it was a small white area, then became red and inflamed in an hours time. It was warm to touch. Very itchy this time. I used a no touch thermometer on it and it read 100.4. My forehead temp was 97. It is feeling better and going away again, but I thought it was odd and that you should know. Thanks.

Then i was ok for 2 days then my arm started to hurt and i got a runny nose and a mild headache and fatigue. My nose ran so much i did not work the next day. I received a negative covid PCR test. then 1 day later my left arm started to itch, turn red and swell. It has continued through today (the swelling is about 4 inches by 3 inches, over my left deltoid). i just took Benadryl. i am now on day 9 post vaccination.

                                                After sitting  for about 10 minutes, I noticed my tongue was swelling up in the back of my throat. I noticed my airway was narrowed and tongue felt very tight, but I was still able to breath. I told the man at the doorway assigned to help people find a seat after their shots. He said, &#34;We all have different reactions,&#34; brought me water, and I drank it.  After another 10 minutes, the symptoms were the same, not better not worse. After 10 more minutes the symptoms were better. And after another 10 minutes, I left.  When I made it back to my car, I noticed tightening across my forehead. This developed into a frontal lobe headache which continued off and on for the next 3 days. Also noted for the next 2 days was waking with swollen lips, face and extremities, and occasional ringing in the ears lasting 1-2 hours.

                                                After the 1st dose, two days later I had an infected tooth.  After 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine, I woke up the 2nd day with my neck lymph glands completely swollen, my jaw hurt really bad, and every tooth in my mouth hurt, and I had another infected tooth on the other side of my mouth.  I had to take an antibiotic for both tooth infections.  Teeth were not infected prior.  By the end of day 2, my lymph nodes were back to normal using Advil for swelling.

Rested on the couch, huddled under a blanket from about 12:30 on Saturday afternoon till about 11pm when I then went to bed.  During the day on Saturday I took at total of 4 ibuprofen, spaced out, and slept on an off.  By 6:30 am Sunday when I woke up, still a little fatigued, and slight body aches and still lymph node swelling and pain.  Went about with normal routine on Sunday, just a little slower.  By Monday morning the only side effect left was the lymph node pain and swelling and pain around the injection site.  At the time of this report, about 7 pm Monday, the lymph nodes are almost pain free, the injection site is slightly painful when touched.

Nothing then until day 7 then I started to feel run down and noticed a lymph node on my left chest at the clavicle.  It was large .  I wasn&#39;t thinking about my vaccine at all at that time.  I made an appointment with the PAC and he was concerned about it and had me do an ultrasound and blood work.  The ultrasound showed nodes measuring 4-16 mm concerning for lymphoma or just reactive. Then I had a ct and the  impression was indeterminate left axillary lymphadenopathy.  For the next 7 days I was home in bed a lot and was not able to take call as scheduled at my work place.  They hurt and I also developed a rash on the injection site, the back, the scalp and neck.  It itched and was annoying.   As the days progressed my nodes on my chest hurt and I could feel them as well as my groin  and abdomen.  January 28 my left arm started burning and hurting when I stretched it out to do activities or work.  February 1 a lymph node appeared in my inner elbow space I confirmed this with my Dr. that it was a lymph node.  It doesnt hurt as much now as before it swelled.  Not drinking extra water on any given day makes them all hurt more.    I felt rotten enough the 7-14 days after I had a covid test and it was negative.  I just found out today that my Covid 2 igG  Sar2 GB was positive on 1/14/21.  My other lab work was perfect

                                                My arm looks like the articles of Covid Arm.  It got very big, hot, swollen and itchy and is still big but was getting much lighter in color now today seems darker again.  I am now seeing that the ingredients in Moderna are in Neosporin which I am allergic to and had rashes but have not used it in over 20 years.  Should I get the second vaccine.  I am very upset and scared and would love to talk to someone.  Thank you.

                                                At 11pm on the day I recieved the vaccine, I noticed my ears and neck were itchy.  A half  hour later I had a bad sunburn like rash from my ears down to my chest and accross my shoulder s . I went to bed hoping it was just a quick reaction and it would go away. I took 2 benadryl.. When I woke up the next morning I felt like I was on fire. The rash spread over both arms around my torso and down to my hips. It was very itchy and painful.  I called the doctor and he said it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine. To continue with the benadryl,  go to urgent care or er if it got worse or if I had trouble breathing. My appointment for the second dose was cancelled. The rash wasn&#39;t clearing up when I went to bed so I rubbed cortisone 10 cream all over it and went to sleep. Had a restless night , got out of bed in the morning and both my hands were angry red and swollen as was the tops of my feet, the rash was a bit better on my arms, back and chest, but my buttocks down to my toes had angry red rash with welts, welts were also on my hands and wrist area I also had some chest tightness and a little difficulty swallowing. . I called urgent care to see if I could come in and I was told to go to er if I could drive or call 911. I went to er.  The dr put me on an iv with benadryl, pepsid and a steriod. The swelling came down and the redness was easing up along with the pain. Dr. said it was a drug allergy,  and I was allergic to vaccine. I was discharged with a prescription for prednisone and to continue the benadryl and pepsid for 5 days. I have no health insurance,  I cant afford it.

The radiologist who reviewed that MRI noted, &#34; Multiple enlarged level II cervical lymph nodes, for which further evaluation with dedicated CT or MRI of the neck with intravenous contrast is reccommended&#34; These enlarged nodes did NOT present any pain for me or any other issue.  That MRI which i got on 2-5-2021 with contrast was noted to be &#34;Normal&#34;  I am reporting this as an adverse effect of Moderna vaccine since i have seen reports of this as a possible effect of the vaccine.

The headaches are to my temples and to the back of my head with inflammation on my head.  The next day I went to see my PCP in the early afternoon because my blood pressure. My blood pressure readings 140/70, 166/76, 144/80 and 161/89. My doctor put me on BP medication, Metoprolol to take for a few days. I also experienced jaw pain and I went to the dentist where an x-ray was done, which was negative. I was also put on antibiotics due to a suspected middle ear infection. I felt like I had a spiral headache.  I saw my PCP, nurse practitioner who gave me a steroid injection which helped. I have cancelled my second dose injection. I have been sick for 4 weeks. I still have the jaw pain with a ringing sensation to my left ear.  Tomorrow I will go get more tests done. I am also having swollen neck with lymph nodes swollen.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

I called Dr. office, they agreed to see me in the afternoon.  At 3:30pm I saw Dr. said that it&#39;s lymph and I should keep an eye on it.  He recommends an ultra sound if not better in two weeks. Left shoulder is painful and it is a little hard to type, but not a big deal. 2/25/21 about 9:00pm I went to the bathroom I had a bright red bowels.   2?26/21 I am waiting for Dr. (she has been my stomach doctor for many years) to speak with her about the bloody bowel.

Sort of light headed.  My heart was racing.  When I looked at my watch it recorded my heart rate at 160 beats per minute!!  I started taking deep breaths and a technique called EFT tapping to calm me down.  Eventually it worked, but I felt extreme tiredness after that.  When I woke up in the morning my entire face was swollen.  I also noticed on the 2nd day after vaccine shot I had dark purple circles under my eyes.  None of those things have ever happened to me before in my life.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

Soreness in arm continued for 3 weeks, on and off.  Sometimes it felt like deep bone pain, she described as excruciating.  Sometimes woke her at night.  Did not occur every day.  Some arm swelling.   The injection was given at where she works.   This PHN did not give the vaccine, but patient called to inform of reaction.  We were going to complete this form together, but patient decided she&#39;d do herself.  I am not certain she will, so am sending the info I was told.  She received 2nd injection 3/1/2021.  Side effects seem less vigorous, by report, so far this time.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful.

My doctor recommended that I only have the 1 vaccine.  *I had very bad case of COVID in 03/2020. I didn&#39;t go to the hospital but I should have.

                                                I had a fairly severe case of Covid, diagnosed on December 28, 2020.  I would estimate that symptoms lasted for 3-4 weeks.  I received my first Covid vaccine on March 13.  I awakened in the middle of the night after the shot with fever of 102, chills, nausea, and a headache.  My arm was swollen and throbbing with a large red circle where the shot had been administered.   These symptoms continued until Monday at around noon,  for over 24 hours. I am writing to you because I think the CDC must study whether or not people who have had Covid should be taking these shots, certainly not both shots.  I will NOT be taking the second shot.

I took ibuprofen for the swelling and for the heat. After I contacted by health care provider I was told to take Claritin. I took an allergy medicine. Still have rash but itch is subsiding.

Saw an article about Moderna rash.  Noticed swelling of left arm pit.  On 3/6/21 not as much pain but increased swelling of left arm pit and left side of left breast.  That evening noticed rash like area on upper arm that itched a little.  Used Benadryl.  Had appointment with my doctor on 3/12/21 for annual check up.  Still some swelling and rash was still present.  Doctor explained that my system was responding and that I should get the second shot.  All symptoms are almost gone today.

The patient states that she has a history of Covid prior and received a Madera vaccine 2 days ago.  This was the first vaccine.  She states that she had a significant amount of redness and swelling at the vaccine site on her left arm initially.  Yesterday she started noticing some swelling above the clavicle on the left-hand side and was concerned that this could be a blood clot given her history of Covid.  She states it is tender to the touch.  She has not had a fever and denies any redness.  No history of similar in the past and no prior venous thromboembolism.

                                                She received the vaccine and then a couple of days it felt itchy, and it was a little red, swollen but not too much.  She then noticed that it was going down but still a little itchy.  Now it&#39;s the size of a quarter but over onto the sides of the other arm, the size of the inside of the palm and very itchy.  She thought it might have been a mosquito bite, but noticed that it has still not gone away and it has spread.  She has not taken anything for the reaction.  She has not called her doctor regarding this and it has continued to grow to where it is so large and spread today, 3/19/21.

I again began to experience slight difficulty in breathing.

She reports that she was able to work (as a hair stylist) on 3/19 with more mild symptoms but still did not feel well and was still having difficulty moving her neck. She reported that she only realized on the afternoon of 3/20 that she had developed swelling at the base of her neck where it met her collarbone. She reported the swollen area was the size of a baseball and was red and warm. She indicated it was on the same side of her body as the vaccination site. She had not yet sought medical treatment when she contacted us but was going to have it examined. She called to notify the pharmacy so that we could report her condition but was not present at the pharmacy on 3/20.  Below item 21 is a required field and since she had not yet sought medical care but intended to this weekend I selected emergency room/department or urgent care.

Skin was raised and after a couple of days, the swelling moved to the left bicep area and remained hot to the touch.  We treated the affected skin with a topical anti-itch cream (up &amp; up brand) and at bedtime the patient took 1 benadryl. The topical cream alleviated the itching and the Benadryl seemed to alleviate the hot-to-the-touch feel of the affected area and after a couple of days the swelling decreased.  the patient continued the course of topical and Benadryl over a course of about 4 days and the itching, swelling, and warmth decreased and went away.

Coincidentally, it seemed to help with headache and dizziness.  Still taking meloxican and headache and dizziness are minimal, but still present.  Will be getting off the meloxican on Friday, 3/26, and we&#39;ll see???  3/ 20 - started with fever blisters and mouth ulcers(probably from shot or stress  all this has brought on my body)

It was red, raised, warm to touch and very itchy.  By day 10, the spot grew to about 3 inches and it was somewhat of a square shape.  By day 12, the swelling was gone and the spot was smaller but a little dark and flaky.   I have photos and I sent them to my doctor as well.

                                                Sore arm right away - that evening I could hardly move my arm. When I woke up the next morning, I had all of the symptoms that I had when I had the virus and I had 100.5 fever - headache; tired; achy. And those lasted not even a whole day and then they went away. Then the next night after that I couldn&#39;t sleep on the arm it hurt so bad. And the next day I noticed a rash - in the area around the shot on the top part of the left  arm and it was burning and hot  and it itched real bad. I took Benadryl. I went to the doctor (on the 18th or 19th - went for other reasons and I also showed her my arm) and she gave me some prednisone but I didn&#39;t take all of it because it started going away. I only took a day of the prednisone and day 6 it seemed to be going away.  I have photos of it. My symptoms had resolved by second dose. 2/12/2021 - I had a headache for a day after the second dose but that was it.

                                                My first dose simply resulted in a sore arm.  The second dose gave me an extremely sore arm...at 3 pm I couldn&#39;t lift a small glass of water to take ibuprofen.  It hurt over my entire shoulder, up my neck and down my arm.  I had no appetite , eating made me queasy and I went to bed at 10.  I woke up a little after midnight in terrible pain:  excruciating headache, all my lymph nodes hurt (both arms, groin, thighs), body aches all over.  I was chilling, but I was in too much pain to shiver, and had horrible nausea --?from the pain??.   I managed to get more  blankets and fell back asleep.  I woke again at 4 am in even more pain and nausea, and a fever of 102.6.  (My baseline body temp is usually around 96.5.  I rarely get fever that high). The pain was so bad I wanted to chop my head and arm off.  I got a cold wet washcloth for my head, put on lighter weight clothing ( it took a lot of effort to do anything  with the pain.  I was dizzy and stumbling).  And was able to fall back asleep for a few hours.  Fever started coming down around 9am, so I tried drinking water.  Slowly improved as the day progressed

                                                I recently retired after 37 years and now stay and provide significant weekly care for my elderly parents.  Because I am a primary caregiver for my parents, and have been throughout the months of the pandemic, I explored various potential paths to ethically and appropriately get in line for a vaccination.  When I took my mother in for her second vaccination at the Health Department in late in March I was able, while my mother was waiting, to converse with a county public health care worker about options and avenues for me to obtain the vaccine as well. She could see, clearly, that I was a caregiver for my mother, so she took down my name and number, and she called me the next day to say that I could, as a caregiver, proceed to sign up for their next clinic vaccination day that would be happening on Thursday, April 1st.   I arrived for my noon vaccination time at the Health Department before 12 on Thursday, April 1st. I proceeded through the check in line and screening questions, and arrived at vaccination site #1 at 12:05 where I was promptly given the Moderna vaccine (lot #026B21A).  Within seconds of the injection, I knew that I was having a reaction. My heart immediately began pounding, my tongue swelled and the room disintegrated into swirling flashes of color. I looked into the kind eyes of my vaccinator and remember distinctly saying to her in those first few post-injection seconds that, I was, ??sorry, but I think that I am having a reaction.?  The vaccinator then took me over to the nursing site coordinator who proceeded to check and record my vitals. I do not have that sheet with the vitals that she recorded, but I do remember that my heart rate and blood pressure measures were high. I sat as she continued to monitor me.  After 20-30 minutes, as best I can recall, my vitals were not improving, but remained elevated and even seemed to be trending higher. Also, the swelling and tingling in my tongue was worsening and seemed to be spreading to my lips and face, and down to the base of my neck.  I began to feel dizzy, like I was going to faint, so she had me lay on the floor with my legs elevated.  Additionally, it was becoming more difficult to breath because of the pressure in my neck. She had earlier and initially offered me Benadryl for the symptoms I was experiencing but I did not previously have good luck with Benadyrl the one time I took it, and also was unsure if I would have been able to swallow it. At 12:40 she thus gave me an injection of epinephrine (3mL) in my thigh and an ambulance was called. I was transported to the ER at the hospital. (Please note that the nursing site coordinator provided top-notch, high quality care through-out my entire emergency medical reaction experience, and I am very grateful and appreciative of her professional and caring response.)  In ER they monitored my blood pressure and pulse, and other aspects of my heart rhythm, as well as the swelling and tingling that continued in my tongue, lips, face and forehead.  I met with the Dr., and worked with RNs during my time there where they continued to monitor me for a number of hours. By about 4:30, when my vitals had returned to normal and stabilized for over an hour, they released me from the hospital. Since my release from the hospital, late in the afternoon on Thursday, April 1, I have noted only a few, relatively minor persisting symptoms which have included tongue, lip and face numbness and tingling. Also, I have noted, from time to time, some periods of continued heart rate elevation, though wonder if it is more of an almost ?PTSD? type of reaction than a pure physiological response, since, for example, just retelling this story right now is causing my heart rate to rise as I recall what happened.  Needless to say, this vaccination induced medical event, explained above, made for a surreal and frightening day unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Processing of it, and grappling with its implications, from concrete to existential, is seeming equally daunting, and it is here where I have a range of questions for which I am seeking assistance and perspective from the CDC:  The most concrete types of vaccination questions first: They indicated I should not try to obtain the second dose of the Moderna vaccine but that I should consult and maybe it could be given to me in a hospital setting? I welcome thoughts and feedback on how to proceed to become ?fully vaccinated.? What about another vaccine?  What about the additional boosters now being discussed for the new variants? Will I need to consider a ?cave dwelling? of some type for myself in the future since I will not have the vaccination card that is being discussed as ?the ticket to travel? in the future?  Will there be special cards for folks like me who tried but for whatever strange immunological reason was not able to take the vaccine? Increasingly complex, bigger picture questions next: Would any type of ?reach-out? to Moderna be in order? Or, do you, at the CDC, reach out to Moderna for me as a result of this VAER? Are they studying people like me?  My sense, from what little reading I have done, is that what happened to me, though severe, is rare, though definitely want the producers of the vaccine to know about my experience. Bordering on existential questions: What does this mean for me and my life going forward? Should I meet with Moderna, or some type of allergy specialist to better understand what may have happened, and what I will need to watch out for in the future? As everyone begins sharing vaccination cards and experiences, what should I say? I don?t want to scare others away from doing what is needed to save lives by sharing my experience, and don?t want to fuel the ?anti-vaxers.? What about the lingering disquiet and unease that something I sought to help and protect me seems like it might have/nearly killed me? The pandemic has already shaken and taken so much in so many of our lives.  Immunization seemed to promise to give back some of what the pandemic has taken, yet, feeling now that ?normal? is not only more distant but possibly will not be achievable for folks like me, rare though we seem to be?

Felt nauseated/ did not vomit. My eyes ached. I stayed in bed for 24 hours. Two days after the injection most of the symptoms had subsided but my vision was very blurry. I have experienced the same type of blurry vision after taking Nyquil, so I don&#39;t take it anymore. Now 3 days after the second Covid shot, my vision is clearing. I am developing a cold sore which I feel may be another reaction to the vaccine. I did not take any medication for the symptoms and did not report it to my doctor. I just wanted the fact of the symptoms to be included with the CDC data.

                                                NOT SURE THIS IS EVEN AN OUTCOME OF THE VACCINE, BECAUSE I HAVE HAD THE HEAD COLD AT THE EXACT SAME TIME AS GETTING THE VACCINE ON JAN 31, 2020, BUT THOUGHT I SHOULD REPORT.    1.  HAD A VERY MINOR HEADACHE THE TWO DAYS FOLLOWING THE VACCINE, JUST MILD DISCOMFORT.  FULLY RESOLVED ON ITS OWN AFTER TWO DAYS.  2.  MONDAY, JANUARY 4 WHEN I WOKE UP I FELT &#34;PUFFY&#34; - FEET AND HANDS WERE MILDLY SWOLLEN.  NOTICED MY SHOES FELT TIGHTER THAN USUAL AND HANDS FELT A BIT DIFFICULT TO FULLY CLOSE.  THIS IS FLUID RETENTION, AS IF YOU HAD TOO MUCH SALTY FOOD THE DAY BEFORE, AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS I HAD INGESTED MORE SALT THAN I REALIZED ON SUNDAY.  BUT IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE THAT OCCURRED FOR ME AND MY DIET DOES NOT INCLUDE MUCH SALT OR PROCESSED FOODS.  THEN TODAY MY FEET AND HANDS STILL FEEL PUFFY, SHOES STILL A BIT TIGHT AND HANDS A BIT HARD TO CLOSE SO THERE IS STILL SOME FLUID RETENTION GOING ON.  THIS IS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR ME, I AM QUITE HEALTHY AND HAVE A GOOD DIET AND DON&#39;T RECALL THIS HAPPENING BEFORE.    AGAIN, NOT AT ALL SURE THIS IS RELATED TO THE VACCINE, IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HEAD COLD, BUT AS I AM NOT SURE AND THIS IS UNUSUAL AND HAS OCCURRED AFTER RECEIVING THE VACCINE, I FELT I SHOULD REPORT IT.  THIS EFFECT IS VERY MILD AND I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND IT.

Walked in the bathroom had pain in stomach, was very hot and freezing at the same time, was shaking. Head hurt was hurting so bad. Tried standing up from toilet, was passed out. Eye, half of face is bruised and swollen , eye shut for two days. More than forty minutes passed before she could call her husband. Does not remember anything because she was passed out. Husband came in and grabbed her, to get her back into bed. she could not stand. Went to ER at  Hospital. Had CT scan, blood work , EKG, chest xray. Was still kind of out of it but was able to communicate with nurses. Face is still black and blue. Last night got up at 4:00 a.m. something was wrong with her throat. Felt like a walnut was in her throat. Went to doctor this morning. They said it was a reaction from the shot. Got an EpiPen, prednisone. Call them in 2 days to let them know how she&#39;s doing and also wear a heart monitor because they do not know how to take care of her, Has had vision blurriness in both eyes. Has not felt well at all.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

About day six it started to feel a bit better.  A week and a half later it still had a large hard knot at the injection site by 1.16.21 it started to itch. On 1.17.21 it began to itch really bad and swell  and get hard again, that evening I used topical Benadryl and hydrocortisone which made the itch dissipate slightly.   On 1.20. the swelling is noticeable from six feet away and can be seen popping up under my shirt sleeve.  I made an appointment with a doctor for 1.21.21.

I observed a reddened fibrous cord-like area from my axilla to just above the inside of my elbow. Very painful initially. After stretches, massaging, and apply warmth, pain is nearly gone yet cord is still visible and slightly painful. Dr?s appt revealed one enlarged lymph node in same axilla.

                                                Pt is a pleasant 61 year old female who received Moderna COVID19 prime vaccine dose on 1/15/2021 as part of employee immunization event.  Pt reported upper respiratory viral illness the week prior but determined with medical advice that she was well enough to be immunized on the 15th. Immediate post-vaccination period was unremarkable.  Later that evening pt experienced onset of HA and fatigue which progressed to severe HA, low grade fever (~99 F per patient), malaise, and sore shoulder the following day.  Symptoms gradually improved over the next 2-3 days with HA being the most troublesome and lingering symptom.  Pt used OTC analgesics to manage HA pain. On 1/19/2021, four days after prime dose administration, pt noted a visible lump mid-clavicle, determined to be a severely swollen lymph node.  Warm and tender to touch.  Pt sought medical attention for this the following day, 1/20/2021.  Physician&#39;s assessment: &#34;Pt received the COVID moderna vaccine Friday, left arm.  She is a triage RN at Medical Clinic.  She states yesterday a lump appeared on her LT clavicle area.  Pt reports the lump is tender, &#34;warm&#34; but not red, and no surrounding erythema.  Yesterday had HA and a &#34;weird sensation&#34; radiating to LT ear from the lump.  The lump is now the size of a golf ball, did draw a line under it to see it.  She is able to swallow okay and has no other concerning Sx.  No changes in breathing.  Has had headaches, which have been reported possible side effect from COVD19 vaccination.  This vaccination was given quite high in her arm she thinks as well.  Fever Sunday night, 2 days after vaccination.  Has been taking Tylenol and IBU (not what she does usually) taking with food and has some GI upset.  Did try a cool compress on the lump yesterday which did not seem to help.&#34; // &#34;Can clearly see her soft tissue mass above her left clavicle, with a line that she drove underneath it yesterday when it started to form. There is no redness but is certainly tender to touch. Can still see a little bit of bruise in her arm where her vaccine was given in her left arm which does seem quite high, not two finger widths from the acromion process. Discussed prednisone but she is terrified of this as she was given a Symbicort inhaler not that long ago and felt that the steroid really made her wired. Recommend warm compresses, alternate between Tylenol ibuprofen with food and even topical Voltaren gel which she has at home and Arnica gel to area. Can certainly get CBC CMP for further evaluation. Discussed soft tissue ultrasound if this does not improve, will order this today in case it is needed she can just get that scheduled. She is going to report her vaccine reaction to the link she was given on the paper which I think is appropriate. Hopefully symptoms will improve in the next few days and then can proceed with her second vaccination a month from the first.&#34;  I spoke with patient today, 1/27/2021, to submit VAERS report. She reports swollen lymph node is still visible though size and sensitivity continue to slowly diminish.

                                                Fever, chills, achiness started approximately 12 hours after vaccine was given. The chills were more of a tremble and shaking of my whole body. Pain and swelling of lymph nodes under left arm. The fever continued through the next day and evening, as did the lymph node pain and swelling. The lymph nodes are still a little tender and there is still some swelling today, 2/3/21. The only thing I did was take Tylenol for the fever and body aches, and rest.

                                                IM vaccination was  given in LUE deltoid. On the day of the vaccine felt slightly dizzy and more fatigued. The following day, I developed a painful, enlarged lymph node in left supraclavicular area. The next day I felt overall weakness and tiredness. No fever noted, but I was frequently flushed and had hot flashes with perceived sudden weakness. I had slight nasal congestion and prolonged sneezing spells on the following days. I had to find a place to sit down and remove my lab coat and turn down the heat because of hot flashes at work. I had fecal urgency and loose stool x 2 on 3/5/21. I have mild lymph node enlargement in left neck today (2/6/21) that is not painful. I had pain at the injections site for 2-3 days after the first vaccine injection that awakened me from sleep a couple of times. The second injection was given in the same arm. All of my symptoms are easily managed with Tylenol, Motrin, fluids and rest.

                                                On day 6 I noticed a slightly raised red rash on my left deltoid around injection site extending slight down to my bicep. The rash was itchy and slightly warm to touch. I also had swollen nodes under my left arm and over my left clavicle. Rash persisted for over 10 days and there is still a lymph node swollen over my left clavicle.

                                                I woke up early the morning following the vaccine with pain in my left hand.  It was hugely swollen and I could not bend my fingers.  I went into the bathroom and found the the left side of my face and my left eye were black and blue.  The hand then turned black and blue.    Today is day 5 following the vaccine and the hand and eye are only marginally better.  As background, a year ago I had a benign lipoma cut out on my face, left side just above the brow.  The face looked identical then as now.  About 18 months ago I had surgery on the left hand to correct a trigger thumb.  Again, the hand then looked exactly like it does now.  On day three after the vaccine, a knee replacement scar on my right leg had turned purple.  No bruising nor sensitivity anywhere else on the knee--just along the line of the scar.  That surgery was 10 years ago.  Unlike the other surgical sites, it has now returned to normal flesh color.

                                                After 45 minutes of receiving vaccination , the knuckles in my left hand, the arm I received the shot in, began to hurt very badly.  Before I was able to get home,  7 minutes away, both hands hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t hole the steering wheel and I was having cramps in my legs.  I could hardly walk up the steps to my house because my ankle joints hurt so badly.  I went to bed  right away and slept .  My hands hurt really badly, but I knew the vaccination caused an inflammatory response so I figured just  rest.  By the end of the day Tuesday, I couldn&#39;t type and could not hold the steering wheel to drive home.  I felt out of breath, I hurt all over, my muscles ached and were cramping.  I was nauseated, very emotional.  I had a fever that spiked at over 101 degrees.  I was so chilled that I was shaking violently. I hurt in every joint, my lymph nodes were painfully swollen, my heart was racing, normal pulse for me is 68 to 72, it was 88 to 90.  Halfway up our stairs, I just stopped, couldn&#39;t make my legs work.  Day 3 I called my doctor, had a virtual appointment I knew I couldn&#39;t drive or ride 45 minutes away.  I missed 3 days of work, stayed home all weekend and was better by Monday.  It was 3 weeks before my hands quit aching.  The pain came and went in my ankles, wrist, knuckles, hips and knees.    Food still nauseates me.

I had cold chills (ran no fever),  dizzy, light headed, woozy, runny nose, eyes ached, head ached, muscle on left side of my neck sore also my gland under my jaw hurt, I was so tired and as the day went on I felt worse . When I went to bed, it felt like I had a softball size knot under my skim in between my arm pit and under arm (left side). There was a short time with my asthma, used my inhaler and it seemed to help. Wednesday March 3rd, Woke up and I was woozy all day and just didn&#39;t feel right. I did not feel as bad as the day or evening  before, just tired. My left arm still swollen and rash. Not at all the systems the day before.  Thursday March 4th, I just didn&#39;t feel right. My left arm still swollen with the rash. I felt so much better than the 2 days before. Friday March 5th back to almost normal. Swelling had went down some but still had the rash. Saturday March 6th I felt normal, My left arm swelling went back down and still had a rash. Sunday March 7th  swelling gone and I just have a small amount of rash on the sides of my left arm.

                                                Initially just a sore arm almost immediately after vaccination. Then by the morning after the COVID-19 vaccination, extreme muscle and joint aches and horrible lethargy and a dull headache, all of  which lasted nearly 24 hours. Then starting three days following the vaccination soreness under the arm that the vaccination was given in the area of the lymph nodes. (Two things to note:  1-I donated blood on Feb. 8, 2021,  and the agency reported I had antibodies against COVID-19, probably due to an exposure in November 2020; after that exposure I had the mildest of upper respiratory symptoms, a very low grade fever and very achy joints for about a week and a half, but nothing that kept me from actively  working at home, and 2-I had traveled for work from Feb. 23-March 2, 2021, returning home two days prior to my first COVID vaccine on March 4. The day after I had returned home (March 3) I was very tired and achy, but by the next day I felt fine, so I went for my COVID vaccination. Perhaps my body&#39;s immune system was fighting off a re-exposure to COVID from the travel on March 3 and then I had the stress of the vaccine on the 4th which may have increased my reaction to the vaccine? )

After receiving my 2nd Moderna shot approximately 6 hours later I started having side effects.  They were a combination of chills, leg pains, leg and feet cramping, headaches, sore arm, nausea, dizziness, exhaustion, stomach pain.  I was unable to get out of bed for 2 days and the side effects lasted for 7 days that I was either in bed or on the couch, not the 24-48 hours that I was told I could expect.  I just called both my general physician and my GI doctor to alert them and they said to continue to treat the symptoms.

The next day, I woke up and both lips were swollen, the left side of my face was swollen and the left side of my lip was twisted to the left.  I contacted my allergist and spoke to him online and sent pictures.  He advised me to take Benedryl  every 4 hours or Zyrtec twice a day.  If it got worse call back.  That evening some of the swollen ness went down.  Little by little each day the swollen went down but the cold sores remained.  By Saturday which is today  the swollen ness is all gone but all the cold sores are remaining and are painful.  I am continuing to take Zyrtec  and treat the cold sores with cream.

It is now the 21st of March and it still is itchy and a little red.   I have been putting hydrocortisone 1% cream on it 3 times a day, and taking benadryl 2-3 times a day.    I went to the doctor to advise.  My doctor was unavailable. I am concerned about taking the next shot on April 7th.  I need to be advised.

                                                When I received my vaccination the nurse mentioned  there was a little blood.  One week to the day I started experiencing an itch around the injection sight. I was woken a few times thru the evening itching my arm. In the morning the area of my arm that received  the injection was warm to touch, swollen and it looked like I was punched in the arm. The red bruise that appeared  was round and the diameter of an orange. This lasted till Monday. I took 1 Benadryl tablet Monday evening and went to sleep   Woke up Tuesday morning and the redness, itch and swelling were gone

                                                Nine days after receiving the vaccine, my vaccine site on my arm started itching really bad, and when I went to scratch it, I felt a very large (~size of a tennis ball) bump on my arm that was also very hard and very red. Initially, I thought it must be a spider bite, though I haven?t noticed any spiders in my home, and I simply watched it for any sign of infection (which never happened). The next day I also noticed an unusually high degree of fatigue which limited my ability to do much of anything for three days, thus far! Throughout the day and night, without warning, my eyes become really heavy, and I feel like I?m going to immediately drop off to sleep. My eyes also begin to burn, and when I close them I simply fall asleep for about a half hour. This has been happening off and on all day for three days, so far. I have no idea if there?s any connection to the vaccine or to the sudden appearance of a hard, big, red, itchy bump at the vaccination site on my left arm.

                                                On March 19, 2021, around 8:30 PM, my left arm began itching very intensely right at the vaccination site. When I went to scratch the itch, I felt a very large (~ size of tennis ball), round, red, hard bump on my arm. It had been nine days since my vaccine, and I hadn?t noticed any other side effects, so I figured it was probably a spider bite (though I haven?t, yet, noticed any spiders in my apartment). I watched it for signs of infection, but so far haven?t seen anything to cause alarm. It?s been three days, and the bump is still there but has gotten a lot smaller. Along with this big  bump on my arm, I also began noticing (next day) that I was extremely fatigued - almost to the point of dropping off to sleep while still standing. I would sit down and fall asleep almost immediately and would sleep for about 30-45 minutes. This has happened on and off all day for the past three days, though it?s also getting better. I have no idea if any of this is related to the Covid-19 vaccine but felt I should, at least, report it to someone.

It was itchy feverish and swollen and the redness spread down to my elbow.  The doctor gave me antibiotics and a Benadryl cream. My arm was still swollen even after the whole dose of antibiotics. I got the second dose in the other arm, the rash came up a little sooner but I was ready, and I used the Benadryl right away and it went down.

I took ibuprofen  in the morning before I went to work and  more ibuprofen on my lunch hour and before I went to bed.  No fever, sore arm and very sore glands in my neck on the left side, there is also a lump on my neck.  The pain goes up in my left ear.

                                                An immediate funny taste in my mouth but so I left after sitting for 20 minutes. About 5 min later, my voice started to get hoarse like it does when I&#39;m having an allergic reaction, began coughing and trying to clear throat.  I pulled over and used my inhaler as first line of defense before trying epi pen.  The inhaler got me home, I continued to have the build up in my lungs and breathing issues, wheezing.  I continued to use my inhaler and gave myself a neb treatment.  My arm got hot and it was swollen with bumps and very itchy.  I treated with cool compress, cream and took Benadryl.  I took Benadryl and Loratadine the remainder of that day/evening and into Saturday evening.  Saturday evening, I used my inhaler 1 more time because I felt my lungs filling with phlegm (all clear) and was still coughing.  This last use made me throw up all the clear fluid that was gathering in my lungs and I felt much better and breathing went back to normal.  I used my inhaler once on Sunday and Monday and I haven&#39;t needed it since.  Funny thing, my right arm began to itch and got red and hot in the same area as my left but I got the injection in my left not my right arm.

                                                On Wednesday, March 24th my husband and I got our 1st Moderna vaccine at 8:30 am. Felt good the rest of the day. On Thursday, March 25th I woke up and the bag under my right eye was really swollen and I felt like I had a big cold sore coming out on the top right side of my lip. My arm was swollen like a 2x2 area and tender but other than that I felt good. At 9:30 am that same day I started getting a headache and my stomach felt really upset. I didn&#39;t throw up but felt like I was going to.  About 10:00 am I really felt sick to my stomach and extremely tired. My headache was more intense and mostly on my right side (same side as my eye and cold sore). By noon I had the chills and was running a temperature over 100. At 3:00 when I got done with work I slept. I was only awake for a total of 1 hour and went to bed for the night at 8:15 pm. I still had a bad headache, upset stomach and chills and my arm was swelling bigger but I slept all night. On Friday, March 26th I woke up and my face looked worse. The cold sore was getting bigger and the bag under my eye was huge making my eye almost shut. I still had  a bad headache and the injection site was getting bigger and stuck out far. It was hot to the touch. It was bright red and bumpy and hurt to touch it. I no longer was sick to my  stomach and I had no fever. My face was still looking awful and about 2:00 pm I started running a fever again. I still had a headache. I still felt tired. On Saturday March 27th, my bag under my eye looked a little better but the cold sore was getting worse. I had a slight headache, no fever and not sick to my stomach. However, the lump at the injection site got huge.  It was the size of the palm of my hand and stuck up about an inch. It was hot to the touch and red.  By 9:00 pm my eye and face were worse and the right side of my face was drooping. On Sunday March 28th 8:00 am my face was worse and itchy. The cold sore was spreading up the right side of my drooping face and my eye was almost shut. I called the Teledoc and had a video call. She said that the vaccine triggered a virus in my system. She called in a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM 4 pills. Took 2 pills at noon and then the last 2 that night before bed. She said to give it 2-3 days and it should clear up. On Monday, March 29th 6:30 am the lump in my arm is a little smaller but my eye is worse. I looked horrible. On Tuesday, March 30th I still had a low grade headache and my lip and right side of my face is kinda numb. I called my doctor and made an appointment for Wednesday, March 31st. On Wednesday, March 31, 2021, I woke up and now had a canker sore inside my top lip on the right side of my face in addition to looking like a monster. I went to the doctor?s office at 7:30 am and she said that I definitely have a virus going on and now I have Bell?s Palsy as a result. The doctor gave me a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM tablets to take 3 times a day for 7 days. She also prescribed Prednisone 20 MG to take 3 tablets for 7 days to relief the itching and irritability of my face.

                                                The night I received the first Moderna vaccine I had a low-grade fever with muscle aches. The next morning when I woke up, I had abdominal pain, which became localized in the lower right quadrant. My friend, who is a nurse, told me I should go to the ER as it sounded like I had appendicitis. I was admitted at to the hospital  on 1/16. After blood work and an abdominal CT, the diagnosis was acute appendicitis. Dr.  performed a laparoscopic appendectomy at 7 AM on 1/17.  I was discharged that night. On 1/25, I started running a fever. Blood work revealed my WBC to be 33,000. Dr. asked me to return to the ER. My fever spiked to 104.6 and I was admitted to the hospital for 5 days of IV antibiotics to manage an infection in my abdomen. By 1/31, my WBC was down to 11,000 and I was discharged.

Contacted via phone and e-mail, Occupational Health Services on 1/1/2021. I also saw  an ED physician at on 1/1/2021 who said a local inflammation reaction was unlikely, probably cellulitis, and prescribed doxycycline. The affected area of my arm was marked to follow progression of red, warm area.  Began doxycycline 1/1/2021. Next morning red, warm area of arm is now outside of marked area and down to below my elbow.  I have an appointment with Occupational Health on Monday, January 4,2021.

I was bloated, swollen, nauseous. About 4 hours after the vaccine there was some relief, but the pain came back multiple times that night, would subside and was mostly better the next day. I did vomit around 7pm. I took antacids and simethecone with no relief.

I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

                                                Hi,  I was vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine (1st administration) on 1/13/21. I have had persistent and very significant swelling since that day and it has not abated as of today, 1/20/21. The reason for this report is that I believe the swelling is not typical axillary swelling which I believe would be right under the arm where the lymph nodes are; rather it is located lower down and much farther away from where the lymph nodes are under my arm. It is a large swelling that is located to the side of my chest on the same side of the body as my vaccinated arm (which was my left arm).   I have not checked fever but do not think I have any. I do have headache as of today. Can you advise on whether this swelling is a typical reaction and whether there are any steps I should take at this time ?  Thanks very much,

On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

                                                One week after getting the Moderna vaccine I developed a small red mark under my left arm (this was the arm the vaccine was administered). 3 days later it developed into a very large , very painful lump under my left arm. (size approximately 1.4 X 0.8 x 0.9 cm ). I saw my PCP who set up an apt for an ultrasound. Ultrasound completed and appears that this is a skin infection with an abscess developing. Im now on antibiotics and have an upcoming apt with a surgeon. I am 26 days out from receiving the vaccine and the lump has not gone down in size and is still painful. I am postponing my 2nd moderna vaccine due to this possible adverse reaction.

By 5:00, my eyes were itchy and burning like they were on fire, then my throat, nose, ears, and then my hands swelled up and itched and felt like they were on fire.  I also had chills.  I took Tylenol and Benadryl and also felt the need to increased my Flovent HFA 220 mcg from once a day to twice a day on Tuesday and Wednesday.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl when and as the symptoms reappeared.  I only needed Benadryl Wednesday night and woke up this morning with a bit of a headache.  Took Tylenol and went to work today.  I feel tired and my hands still hurt this afternoon(Thursday 2/4/2021) .

Pain all night and most of day, hard to move right arm without pain. No other sickness or fever. Injection site however is hot, and remained such so far. Current time is about 72 hours since onset of reaction. I circled a pen around the spot after 48 hours so I could monitor it. It does not appear to have gotten larger thankfully, but itches a lot now at 72 hours. Redness does appear less bright, and the hard area appears to have softened slightly. This affected area is about a 2 to 2 and half inch diameter circle on right arm. The hotness extends to the entire upper arm basically and the pain the same. At times my lower arm aches.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a 62-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced an anaphylactic reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as reported, included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome.  On 24 Jan 2021, about 15 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24 Jan 2021, 30 minutes prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient took prednisone (dose unknown), per instructions from her doctor due to her history of anaphylactic reactions. She did notify the vaccinators of her history and there was an ambulance present. About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient started coughing, had heavy chest pain, trouble breathing, and felt like her throat was constricting more than usual. No rash developed. She approached the ambulance and asked if she could take diphenhydramine. She took one dose, followed by 3 other doses, and felt a bit better. Consent given for Safety to follow up with patient.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event, anaphylactic reaction was resolving at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62 year old female patient with medical history of included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome. She experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction that needed treatment diphenhydramine. The event occurred approximately 15 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration even thought the patient took prednisone prior to receiving the vaccine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                10 minutes after shot I felt, chest congestion and a strange taste in my mouth. I stayed at injection facility for over an hour to make sure I would feel better.  Later that evening, I was fine without any marks on injection site. Nine days later I got an itchy, sore arm with a bulls eye, raised red rash larger than a quarter, about 1.75&#34; and a bit warmer than other areas of the arm.

                                                initial symptoms started at ~ 8-12 hr post inj on FRI:  fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain (generalized), back pain from sacrum to occiput, through cranium to behind eyes, nausea, loose stools, exhaustion, arm swelling (6&#34; diameter) with bandaid indented becoming hard (feeling a little like cellulitis).  routinely measure pO2 and body temp--both spiked; resp rate went from normal pattern of 10-12 to 25; night time HR went from low 60&#39;s to the 100&#39;s; pO2 went from 96-98 to 89-91 (Innovo PulseOx)Treated with sleep (slept from 8PM night of shot until 48 hours after the shot), fluids, hot water bottles, arnica (I can&#39;t take NSAIDS), vit C, zinc megadoses;  by ~36 hours post injection I started wheezing and coughing deeply but non productive, both nasal passages were/are open, feels as though phlegm is stuck at bronchi.  By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

                                                Within 1 hour of receiving 2nd vaccine, I started to get pain behind my right eye. That night, the pain turned into shooting pains on right side of head, every 3 to 45 seconds at worse. Head pain continued to Daturday, the 13th, when it stared migrating to right ear (same stabbing-type pain). By Tuesday the 16th, if further migrated to glands below my right jaw line ( same stabbing-type pain). Over last 48 hrs I have also developed scaly patches on right half of scalp. Tonight I started developing scaly rash on top of right side of face.  As of now, stabbing pains continue in right side of head, right ear, and right side of throat.   On Friday the 12th I also had swelling and tenderness under left arm. This has dissipated.

I sat for a little bit and the same thing happen again. My BP started going up and my face started getting red and I just did not feel well, they got concerned with that it progressed to the insides of my cheeks and we were concerned about throat swelling, so they sent me to the ER where I got Benadryl by IV and they also gave me Epi and some other meds and I don&#39;t remember what they were. I was there for about 4 hours.  About 2AM it started coming back again, inside my cheeks started feeling like it was swelling again and I took Benadryl (I was home). I took another dose in the morning and in the afternoon. In fact I kept taking Benadryl pretty regularly for the next 3-4 days. I decided to go to my PCP and he prescribed something else that made me really drowsy, so I went back to the Benadryl and it took another couple of days to feel that the cheeks stopped with the feeling of swelling.  (PCP at the hospital. At this time I still feel tired,  energy levels are just not what used to be before vaccination.

They had a hole in middle and looked like blood. The right side of my face was swollen where i had 3 bumps. Also the ache in the left arm moved to my left calf. Very sore, felt like a charlie horse but I never developed.  I had to limp on the leg a couple of days. I still have the bumps on my face and chest but the hard knots are gone. Just red bumps now. I never  have acne and never had face fillers.

I put Benadryl cream on it last night and hoped it would go away over night but it has not.

The symptoms have slowly improved over several days after the onset.

                                                A 63-year-old female with a medical history of Hashimoto?s Disease, on Levothyroxine 88 micrograms (4 days per week) and 100 micrograms (3 days per week), presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of acute onset of severe, debilitating, fatigue, weakness, anorexia and malaise. She had no clear precipitating events, stated that she was in her usual states of health, active, working as an optometrist at a University hospital. Stated that 1 week before symptom oncer she had her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Stated that 24hrs later her symptoms started associated with low grade subjective fever, however her fever disappeared, and she persisted with severe fatigue. She was unable to do her regular activities of daily living and was hoping her symptoms would resolve but upon persistence and given the severity of her complains she presented to evaluation. She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA &gt;1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 &gt; 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.

                                                Had the ?normal? slightly sore arm (less than the 1st one) that evening BUT I was started to feel more a bit more achy overall at bedtime and applied topical pain ointment. Was woken up at 1AM  by wide spread discomfort spots in entire body..sort of flu?ish, but with several ?heavy?/intense/crampy areas of pain ALL in my back &amp; various muscle groups in the legs. Took OTC pain reliever and applied more topicals. Noticed I kept having chills, but no fever through out the restless, painful night. This continued ALL weekend...at one point I felt I was at a 8-9 level, in tears, even after taking many OTC antiflammitories (that I normally avoid to protect my long term health)and then with some old muscle relaxer (skelatin) &amp; pain (tramadol) ?scripts that I dug up. My left arm was also very swollen, rashy red &amp; hot. By that Monday (2/15), I was a bit better &amp; was able to stop the ?Scripts &amp; drive myself to my pain specialist for my monthly appt? Dr. was surprised to find so much stiffness/inflammation in my body and worried about my arm.  She was able to treat it and my poor body and I felt a bit more doable for a couple of days....but my back always stayed very stressed/strained! It eventually went out on me ??and I have remained in terrible pain for 4 weeks now?with ~20 Trigger spots all over body?bizarre!!!M

Upon arrival she was given 50mg benadryl IVP, 20mg Pepcid IVP, and 125mg Solu-medrol IVP. Soft tissue neck xray showed subglottic narrowing and thickened epiglottis. She had some improvement after IV medications but was admitted to ICU for observation overnight. She was discharged 3/12/2021 in stable conditions on steroids and antihistamines. Pt&#39;s vaccine card did not list vaccine lot number. I reached out to facility for the lot number and have not heard back.

                                                6 days after vaccination, a red sore rash appeared on my left arm, approx 3 inches below vaccination site.  Rash spread to an area of approximately 5? wide and 4? high and is swollen hot, itchy and uncomfortable and persists today, 10 days after vaccination. At the same time as the rash appeared I began to have sleepless nights, waking 2 hours after going to sleep every night and spending the rest of the night waking every hour. I had no symptoms, apart from a sore arm, until the 6 day point.

I took benedryl and will also use a cold compress.  About 24 hours after the vaccine, I also felt exhausted, achey, with flu-like symptoms for a couple of days. I took aspirin with tylenol (Excedrin Migraine) and slept for a couple of days, then felt better.

In addition, I also experienced a low fever. Then on the third and fourth day, I stated to feel numb on my arms, thighs, fingertips and the bottom of my feet.  I also started to feel chest pain, back pain, and experience migraines. I&#39;ve felt very tired throughout this time, had a dry mouth. The tops of my feet and hands were slightly swollen and my veins were much more prominent as well. The palm of my hands are always very warm and have a visibly pink color. During this time frame, I&#39;ve seen also seen my GP twice. As of today, overall, all of these symptoms have lessened in severity. Although the feeling of numbness has also lessened in severity as well, the slight feeling of numbness is still present as of today-especially on my tongue (23 days after my first dose of the vaccine).

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

                                                I experienced what I would describe as a minor localized reaction. The symptoms I noted on Friday after the vaccine was an itchy sensation and under left arm lymph node tenderness on the side of injection. The area was red firm to touch and approx. 3 inches circular around the injection site.  The symptoms are slowly resolving with the redness/itchiness and firmness at the site. Lymph Node tenderness is resolved.

Felt swollen, but dont think it was, burning sensation on lateral borders and tip of tongue,extremely dry mouth.  Felt as though it had also been burned, and had a few white spots on tip, reddened borders on lateral aspects also, very scallopededges. Note I do have a fissured tongue but this reaction was unlike any I had ever had from eating certain foods that trigger any tongue response, and had not eaten anything night before to trigger this. Lasted a few days and progressively felt normal after 3-4 days.

                                                This patient received her first dose of Covid 19 vaccine by Moderna on January 12 at the pharmacy.  She tolerated it well.  She had a sore right arm at the site of injection for about 2 days.  Soon thereafter she developed some right lateral neck pain for several days that required Advil.  It was hard to turn her head.  That got better.  On January 20 in the evening, she noted pain and achiness in the right deltoid at the site of her shot.  It was pink allover and slightly swollen and mildly warm.  Today, the swelling was slightly more and the redness slightly more.  She asked to see me, her PCP, although I did not give the vaccine.  She denies any fever, chills, sweats.  She has no systemic achiness. She has pain  at the site, even if not touched.  It is slightly warm to touch.  Today the erythema has slightly progressed since yesterday when she marked it with a pen.  She has not taken any antipyretics for several days.  She has no rash elsewhere on the body. The erythema is 5 x 8 cm and oval in shape.  She also has some small right axillary lymphadenopathy.  There are no other lesions on the right upper extremity.

                                                Approximately 1 week after initial dose of vaccine, I developed left axillary adenopathy.  The following day, I experienced mild itching at the injection site and noticed minor swelling.  The entire deltoid region developed diffuse erythema.  Motrin relieved the pain and over the ensuing 3 days, all symptoms resolved.

Ireceived an ultrasound and mammogram of the right axial and right breast to rule out any concern. I was seen by the radiologist and PA-C that reported no masses. PA-C prescribed Gabapentin for the pain. 100mg qd. I continue to take OTC meds for pain as well.

                                                Starting 7-8 hours post vaccination I experienced a sore arm (at injection site), body aches, fatigue and malaise that lasted 48 hours. 4 days post vaccination a submandibular lymph node on the left side of my neck (same side of my body as my injection site) became swollen and tender to touch. The swelling and tenderness increased over a period of 24-48 hours. Today is 1 week post vaccination and my lymph node is still swollen and tender (no decrease). I have scheduled a telehealth visit with a clinician at my primary provider&#39;s office for 2/2/21 at 2:00 p.m.

                                                A couple days after vaccine shot, Feb. 2 redness swelling started on right hand pointer finger just below cuticle, each day I noticed another finger with redness very swollen sore  to touch.  Then noticed same on left hand finger. Went to Dr. Feb. 8. She thought an immune response, but then Dr, did a COVID-19 test on Feb. 9.  It was negative.  by Feb. 12 swelling and soreness went down some but redness is now an inch  from cuticle to joint on 6 fingers on both hands. No problems with joints and any other ill feelings.  Feb. 16  still 6 fingers with severe redness .  I guess I will go to dermotologist now before I get my second vaccine shot.

The redness traveled from my shoulder to my elbow over the course of24 hours. I have ben taking benedryl and tyleno but it hasn&#39;t changed. area is still very red swollen and sore. I do not have a temperature or difficulty breathing. Walk in clinic said to continue with benedryl, ice etc. In the past  20 years I had to go to ER because I had an allergic reaction to something that is still unknown. Bought case I was in anaphlaxis, barely able to breath. Can I safely  have my secon vaccine on 3/7?

On 30 Dec 2020, approximately four hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot Number: 025J20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Dec 2020, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced warmth, redness, and pain in the arm which she treated with ice and diphenhydramine.  On 31st Dec 2020, 14 hours after vaccine administration, the patient started to experience bullous eruption on her arm, pruritis and constant burning sensation in the arm. She reported having swelling extended down to her arm, bruising, discoloration, blisters, small vesicular pustules, erythema down to the side of the arm, and demarcation. She spoke to her primary care provider as her rash continued to evolve. She was started on a methylprednisolone pack but only took two doses for concern it would blunt the immune response to the vaccine. Additionally, she was treated with triamcinolone ointment.  On 03 Jan 2021, the bullous eruptions peeled off with sloughed skin, she had an excoriated area underneath the skin. She also had tenderness and pain in the arm which resolved spontaneously. The patient self-treated the events with benzethonium chloride and vitamin E oil.  On 28th Jan 2021, the patient had hyperpigmentation of her posterior arm with an excoriated area.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, bullous eruption on her arm, bruising, discoloration, blisters, vesicular pustules, significant pruritus, hyperpigmentation, constant burning sensation, arm felt warm, bullous eruption eventually peeled off with &#34;sloughed skin&#34;, redness down to side of the arm and demarcation, looks like a burn, her arm felt warm, painful and was red, and swelling extended down to her arm, was not reported. The outcome of the event, sloughed skin, was considered recovering. The outcome of the events, significant tenderness and pain on arm/significant tenderness and pain and swelling extended down to her arm, was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 63 year old female patient with medical history of hypertension, sulfonamide drug allergy, and penicillin drug allergy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Dermatitis bullous and NS unexpected events of bruising, discoloration, blisters, vesicular pustules, significant pruritus, hyperpigmentation, constant burning sensation, sloughed skin and arm felt warm. The events occurred 14 hours after first dose of the study medication administration. She was started with a methylprednisolone pack and triamcinolone ointment.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Approx. 8 days after injection, noticed red patch (approx. 3&#34;x4&#34;) below injection site.  This  rectangle had surprisingly straight edges and occasionally itched slightly.  Six days later the rectangle is approximately the same size, but has lost its very straight edges, and has paled in color.   Perhaps 10 days after the injection, some swelling was noticed in the left armpit and an intermittent discomfort like a dull pencil poking a particular spot in the armpit was experienced. The armpit swelling/discomfort lasted about 3 days.

                                                All three reactions were the same. I woke up feeling like my throat had a flap that was not allowing me to inhale. I had been snoring and work up abruptly because I couldn&#39;t breathe at that moment.  If I inhaled sharply or sniffed hard to try and clear my throat, my airway blocked. I had a fever and also swollen glands in my neck and under my jaw. Once I got out of bed, I drank a glass of cold water and walked outside in the cold. I felt like it was an allergic reaction; so I took a Benadryl and I tried to go back to bed, but when I laid down it seemed worse, so I spent the night in my recliner. The first reaction was the worst in severity and happened about two weeks after my first injection. The second reaction was less than two weeks later,  the last one happened 4 days after my second injection. All three incidents lasted about 12 hours, but I still feel like my glands are a bit swollen, and I have a hesitation when I swallow. I talked to my doctor today 3/1, he ordered a COVID test and ordered me to quarantine until I get the results.

I sat down to tie my shoe and noted Pitting &#43; 3 or 4 edema to BIL Calves.  Redness , warmth in a few areas.  R leg 1&#34; larger than L.  Then  I mentioned it to another nurse and  she said it could be side affect of Norvasc.  I spoke with my PA about it on 2/12 she D&#39;C&#39;d Norvasc and perscribed  Nefidepine 30 mg ER. I have not taken it yet I am monitoring my BP and it is WNL.   The edema less in calves however continues in ankles.  I have gotten MULTIPLE broken capillaries all over my legs.          Long short it has to be a reaction to vaccine.  And it continues almost 2 months after injection.   I can&#39;t wear most of my socks.  It is BAD.

Upon inspection I found a large area of my upper arm had a large, raised, red/rash patch, In addition, a small spot in my arm pit became very tender (lymph node?). While the rash went away, 27 days later and the tenderness in the armpit is still present.

                                                I have lymphedema so I received my injection in my left hip on 02/24/2021.  On 03/04/2021 my left hip was itchy.  By the morning of 03/06/2021 there was a large round red swollen itchy patch in the area of the injection.  By Saturday morning it was a very large patch on my entire left hip.  By Sunday it wasn?t as red and itchy, but it was large and spreading down the top of my thigh.  Today, it?s lighter in color, but still itches and is the same size.  I looked on the internet to see if there were any delayed skin reactions to the Covid vaccines because I wasn?t told, nor had I heard or read anything about this side effect, which I assumed had something to do with the vaccination since it was around the injection site.  I found articles referencing ?Covid arm? and according to the photos it looked like what was on my hip.  The articles mentioned antihistamines, but I can?t take them because they make me extremely hyper and my heart races.  I?ve kept it clean but have not seen a doctor.   I?m assuming it will eventually go away, but since the public hadn&#39;t been warned about this delayed reaction possibility, I?m clueless.  It?s very scary to have this appear when I?ve heard nothing about this particular side effect and I?m not sure I?ll get my 2nd dose in case there are other side effects not shared with the public.

Felt fine on day 3 post-injection. Starting that evening of 3/5/21 I noted sharp pains of phyarngitis (like Strep), but ONLY on the RIGHT side.  When I woke the next morning,  very painful to swallow, very tender nodes only in the Right neck that were somewhat enlarged.  The pain was strictly located to the RIGHT side of my neck and throat.  No axillary nodes or tenderness.  Today my symptoms persist - I find that I wake up after 4 hours of lying supine due to soreness in Right neck and increased fullness in soft tissues.

After I felt better I ate shrimp on 2-13 and 2-17 and had a reaction to the shrimp on 2-17 which required a doctor visit and complete bloodwork analysis which showed allergy to shrimp and a high titer which could be an auto immune disorder.  Since then I have logged foods and have determined I have  reactions when something has MSG or Maltodextrin.  I have dry back of my throat, a feeling that I have a lump in my throat,  eyes seem a little dry,  the headache has not gone away.  Pressure on the top of my head and my forehead.  Tingling and on fire in hands wrists, forearms, shins and ankles.  I have an appointment with a Rheumatologist on March 30.

This morning upon waking up I felt the itching again and when I went to scratch the injection site felt it was swollen, hard and warm to the touch and when I looked at it in the mirror its also red and more swollen than after I took the shot on 15mar. I&#39;m not having any other symptoms I just thought it should be reported.

                                                I am being treated for cellulitis in my right upper arm with Keflex.  Symptoms were first noticed a week after the vaccine was given.  Symptoms included red, swollen upper right arm, hot to the touch, hard and tender knot about 4 inches in diameter.  After 2 days of the antibiotic and steroid cream, the symptoms  decreased.  I went to urgent care because it was after hours and on a Sunday.  I attempted to treat by putting ice on my arm through out the day, but the symptoms worsened during the day.

History of cellulitis in leg - looked to be the same symptoms. Initially treated on day 9 with antibiotics from UTC (diagnosis potential cellulitis). By day 12 redness continued to spread with pain, itching and heat. 2nd trip to UTC confirms adverse Moderna reaction. Continuing antibiotics along with KENALOG to treat dermatitis symptoms and told to watch for additional reactions.

On Tuesday March 16 I looked up self massage for lymphatic swelling and gave myself a massage to the affected area.  Then today March 18, I saw my personal massage therapist and she did lymphatic release and said that my left arm and armpit across my chest area lymph nodes were swollen and she worked to open them.  I will return on Monday for another treatment.

                                                First four days had the typical sore arm.  On the 5th morning woke up with tenderness in the lymph node area  by the clavicle? on injection side. On  6th day the node is tender and swollen and again on 7th day-tender and feels like a marble in that triangle area on shoulder.  It&#39;s not anything I can&#39;t &#34;tough out&#34; but thought I should mention it. Also, had the injection on this side because I still have all my lymph nodes on the left-as opposed to the right side, which has only 2 left .

The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 15 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 027L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 08 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 0101M20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The first dose of vaccine was taken in non dominant arm and second dose was taken in right dominant arm.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced swollen arm. In between the two doses she felt very hard to breath for few minutes and when she took a deep breath it was fine. She had tylenol for the headaches after the second dose on 08 February 2021. She also had nausea along with headaches. She had blood clogging when she was in a blood donation camp. The event very hard to breath for few minutes and blood clogging were considered as medically significant. Thiamine was provided as medication  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  Follow-up received on 17 Mar 2021 included updated date for first dose of vaccine, and the events very hard to breath for few minutes/dyspnoea, blood clogging/thrombosis.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a strong temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Nausea and headache are consistent with the safety profile of the product

Extreme fatigue. 04/09/2021 left side of neck - 3 swollen lymph nodes. Started as stiff sore neck.  Made appointment with primary for the next Monday 04/12/2021. But in Friday my right side of neck swelled and hurt. Then the lymph nodes swelled. Sore throat. Became worse than left side which was still swollen. Also had sore develop inside mouth. Severe itching to lower face. Saturday I went to Urgent Care. Dr. believed it was allergic reaction to cleaner I was using. The itching probably was. But I have never had my lymph nodes swell like this before. Today is the 23rd and my lymph nodes are still slightly swollen.

I immediately took 2 Benadryl (otc) by mouth and applied ice to the swelling on my face.  When Benadryl wore off, swelling began again, so I took 2 tablets of Benadryl, had to repeat two more times.   As of April 30th at 8 a.m.,  I am not taking Benadryl.  Face is still slightly swollen.  If the swelling starts increasing, will take Benadryl.

It should have been up near the shoulder, but instead the person gave it to me down toward the middle of my arm. I knew something was wrong immediately because it felt so warm and disruptive. The doctor on the scene said it was nothing. Nine days later I went to Urgent Care with swelling, hot-to-the-touch, itchy and a huge knot. The Urgent Care Dr. gave me a five-day prescription for Prednisone and also gave me a prescription for hydroXYzine pamoate, which is an antihistimine.

                                                On day 8 after the injection, I developed a large local reaction  in my upper right arm. It was warm, red, swollen, sore and itchy. It resolved without treatment  after approximately 2 days.  It was not a severe reaction, but odd that it developed so many days after the injection. I work as an RN  and my doctor said she saw this  as a complaint from several who have received the vaccine and that I should report it for your records.

                                                Adverse event: Face swelling especially the eyes (eye lids, tissue between nose and eyes and below eyes), lips and outside the lips (left upper lip and into cheek and lower right lip into chin). Note: I was not having any trouble breathing and I did not think my throat was closing up.  Treatment: Benadryl 50 mg immediately and again 4 hours later,  Allegra 180mg once daily for 7-10 days, Methylprednisolone 4mg Dospak 21S, Famotidine 20mg 1 twice/day for 10 days. Outcome: Spoke to MD about 8PM on 1/19/21; took first dose of Benadryl and Allegra about 8:20PM; MD called in other Rxs and I had to pick them up, so first doses of methylprednisolone and famotidine were taken around 9:05PM; around 10PM or a bit after MD checked on me and I said I thought the lip swelling was improving but it was hard to tell with the eyes; MD had previously instructed me to stay up to 12:30PM in order to take the second dose of Benadryl 50mg, which I did and then I went to bed. In the morning around 9AM, I thought the face swelling had gone down 40-50%. MD called me around 9:16AM and I reported to her that the swelling had gone down 40-50%.  At 10:36PM tonight as I make this report, my swelling as gone down more maybe by an additional 10 or 15%.

                                                I was vaccinated at  Mall on 1/11/21.  I had a minimal reaction of a sore arm for two days.  On the 8th day, my arm became swollen and red around 5:00 pm.  I took advil and cool compresses on the rash. By Wednesday morning it was better and on Thursday morning it was a little better but I went to the doctor.  The doctor noted the rash and swelling and wants me to return on Monday, 1/25.  We are monitoring the rash and swelling and it appears to be getting better.  She did not prescribe any medication.

The very day I did not notice anything but then 24-48 hours after the vaccine it started being pretty bad and it got a point where it got so bad  the whole left side of my face swollen up, my tonsils, my neck, down the throat, only on the left side of my face.  At one point it was hard to swallow (NY Eve), it was hard to swallow and breathe. I had just started taking the medication my DDS prescribed and it was not really helping yet. On New Years day when I woke up a little better.  It took about 4-5 days for the swelling to go down. After 2 doses of the medication prescribed the pain was much more bearable and the swelling started going down. On 01/02/2021 my dentist cauterized some of the sores in my mouth,

The injection site was very painful the day following the vaccination, but there was no pain after that until yesterday when the site became red, hot and itchy.

                                                About 10 hours after receiving 2nd Moderna vaccine on 1/28/21 at 9a my deltoid began aching.  I took 400mg ibuprofen and went to sleep that evening as usual.  Around 3am I began noting severe pain in my left arm and then got up at 5a per usual.   3cm below the injection site bandaid was an orange-sized erythematous swelling.  It was exquisitely tender to touch (like gout).  Any little movement of my left arm was painful.  I also experienced headache, chills, and fatigue but these symptoms were nothing compared to the arm pain.  I took ibuprofen 400mg every 6 hrs and stayed in bed all day 1/29.  My left arm continued to have severe pain all day and that night, though was better the next day.  Today 1/31/21 my left deltoid swelling has decreased to the size of a small lime and the pain has sIgnificantly improved.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  slight nausea within a couple hours of getting shot yesterday. Gone by this morning.  Around 9:00 this morning, I noticed I was having trouble typing.  Looked down at my hands and both hands were severally swollen, to the point that  I could not even make a fist.  This swelling lasted about three hours.  Swelling started to subside around noon and is completely gone now, at 2:30 in the afternoon

                                                Part of the vaccine ran out at time of injection.  The night of the injection my arm started itching.  I was awakened at 4;00 a.m. the next morning with a very stiff, sore, cramping arm.  I had the normal reactions: slight headache, low temp, itchy, swollen, hot red arm, but very stiff and sore. This lasted 3-4 days with the most noticeable reaction being the sore arm from shoulder to elbow.  On Feb 10, one week later, my arm started itching again in the afternoon and by evening was swollen, red, hot, and hurting  just like the first 3-4 days or slightly worse.  It gradually got better after 4-5 days, returning to normal by 2/20.  The only other symptom the second time were blisters on my left hand above my pointer finger and ring finger.  I&#39;m not sure if they were related or not since I walk outside or if I may have been exposed to poison ivy since the blisters looked similar.

The redness encompassed 3/4 of my upper arm from the injection site to the elbow (day 14). On day 9 after injection the site was bumpy and the skin felt rough. The infection site was also bruised and there was still a bump at the site. It was itchy and warm to the touch from day one until day 17.  From days 14-17 there was 2 inflamed bumps on the outside of my arm, on the back side, not at the injection site, which were very itchy and red.  There were also itchy areas on the upper arm but no inflamed bumps.  I went to care my primary care physician and she recommended Clariton daily for the allergic type reaction with cold compressing if needed and was prescribed an antibiotic with instructions to call her office the day before my second scheduled shot, on March 8th.

                                                I experienced pounding headache, severe fatigue and sore and swollen left arm. At 12 noon on Thursday, I took 2 tylenol for arthritis and laid down at 2 pm woke up at 8pm and felt slight relief the pain was not as intense, but still present. The symptoms persisted Friday and on Saturday milder and then with the exception of sore and swollen left arm other symptoms resolved around 2 pm on Saturday afternoon. I did have the virus in March, 2020 (pneumonia, pulmonary embolism) treated and resolved. Also, I am a participant in an antibody study and tested in December , 2020 and did show I was still positive for covid19 antibodies. I am very concerned about taking the 2nd vaccine scheduled 3/31/21. Please advise.

I believe I had slept on it. Day 8 developed itchy rash near the top of left shoulder 9 ?Down forearm, day 13 rash devolped bumps-I have photos of the rash and bumps. Day 14 rash diminishes. Pain in left arm/shoulder continues Day 22 noticed lump (lymph node)base of neck left side-almond sized. From day 15 to 22 lost arm mobility -it was very painful to raise my left arm &amp;especially out to the side.  March 9 I saw my general practitioner. The swollen lymph node at the base of my neck is diminishing in size and flattening out.

It was itchy, and then that&#39;s all she noticed.  Then yesterday, 3/9/21, noticed tenderness going up her neck and around the lump, inward towards the middle of her throat was a little tender.  On the injection site it was a little pink, but today it&#39;s not inflamed, it&#39;s redder and feels warm to touch.  She may have some tenderness in her arm area at the elbow.  She took Advil yesterday and not taken anything today.  She called her doctor and they told her to call us.

Tuesday evening I felt like I had a bit Of the flu-just like after a flu shot. But Sunday morning  around 8 am in the shower I noticed red bumps on my ankles. These continued to spread up my legs  during the day. A lot of them! I took Zyrtec and in the evening there were more including on the back  upper side of my arms. A lot of them! By Monday morning after a miserable night my lower legs below  the knees to ankles were covered and more on my body. I went to the doctor. Believe this is a reaction  to the Covid 19 shot. Taking two 24-hour a day Zyrtec and using Calamine lotion. Still ongoing 3/11.

The redness lasted about 48 hours.

                                                Last part of vaccine sent a tingling feeling down my arm to my middle finger. Once the needle was out it stopped. Came home and iced the area once. 5:15 pm first chills started. Went away after I drank hot tea. Headache started and stayed the rest of the night until next morning. Also at 5:15 started the achy body feeling, my joints hurt. I have a total knee replacement on the right side and it ached. I had a hard time to walk up and down the steps in our house. I was suddenly real tired. Went to bed at 9:00 pm exhausted and feeling nauseated. Slept until 11:15 pm when I woke up to my teeth chattering. Put wool socks and sweater on and extra blanket. Fell back to sleep. Woke up at 7:00 am felt better,  but after being up a short time I felt  off. Took a nap at noon because I became real tired. Slept until 2 that afternoon (now Friday day after injection) and woke up feeling like myself.  Saturday I felt fine. Sunday I woke up to a cold sore on my lip. Tender to  the touch at the injection site but nothing by Sunday.

She states that after 1 day her arm pain resolved but she still had the bruising. On 3/15/2021 patient woke up with swelling, warmth, and erythema distal to her original vaccination site. She denies any injury to this area. The erythematous patchy area distal to her bruising is nonpruritic and nontender to palpation. Patient denies other vaccine reaction symptoms such as headache, dizziness, runny nose, sore throat, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, constipation. I recommended that patient use heat 10min three times daily for reduction in swelling and continue to monitor this site for any changes. If any changes occur patient needs to call the office; patient confirmed understanding. Also advised patient to call office if any new symptoms occur of vaccination reaction; she confirmed understanding.

                                                An episode of angioedema; Hives; A spontaneous report was on 05 Mar 2021 received from a consumer concerning, a 65-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced hives and a second episode of angioedema.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included an episode of angioedema after receiving first dose of mRNA-1273. Concomitant products included sertraline hydrochloride 100 milligrams once daily, and zolpidem tartrate 10 milligrams in the evening, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and cetirizine hydrochloride.   The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection on 10 Jan 2021.  On 07 Feb 2021, approximately 13 days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 20 Feb 2021, approximately 13 days after receiving the second dose of vaccine, the patient experienced hives and a second episode of angioedema. Treatment for the reported events was self-administration of an EpiPen as a treatment.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome of the events, hives and a second episode of angioedema, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Sunday the swelling seemed to move down and around her arm as well as the redness. It has continued to progress each day. Currently her arm is very dark (almost looks like a very dark bruise all over it) and swollen to her wrist. Her hand looks a normal color. She states she bruises very easily anyway due to Plavix.

This subsided, but then on day 7 I developed a rash and swelling at injection shot in an area approximately 3 x 4&#34;.  This has subsided after 2 days, but then on day 10 my entire body started to itch, I developed a rash on my arms and chest  and hives on my forearms and legs.  Day 11 - still experiencing these symptoms, but a little less than the day before.

                                                Some minor pain, redness, and swelling starting about 5 hours after shot and continuing for 1-2 days. Then pain, redness, and swelling went away. Only a small red dot remained at injection site. Then about 1 week later I noticed pain when touching right arm in injection site area with an approximate quarter sized red area and slightly larger than that swollen area around injection site. Now 2 days after noticing that, the red area is getting bigger (about inch and a half diameter) and the swollen area has gotten larger (about two and a half inches in diameter), so I&#39;m having my husband report it for me. I have not used anything to treat this, might try ice today.

                                                The next day after my shot,  I was debilitated. I was in bed with severe chills, nausea, headache, and a sore arm. my muscles hurt all over. I have  history of migraines so I have nausea medication that I used for the nausea. I took Zofran , Flexural, Ibuprofen, Promethazine, and  fioricet over the course of feeling this way so I could manage the side effects. This lasted for a few days and gradually got better. the arm had a red swollen welt at the injection site and was still sore. by 03/20 I still felt bad. on03/21 I started feeling better, the welt was getting bigger and hotter, I put marks on my arm to see if it would surpass the marks, but the next day it had moved completely to a different area on my arm. it&#39;s a ways away from the injection site. (03/22) I noticed my face from the cheek/smile crease has fluids swelling up on both sides of my face but the left side is definitely worse. my face is very swollen. its itchy because I normally have rosacea. I had skin cancer on my face once that was removed and usually causes some tingling but the swelling is causing more tingling.

The night of 03/24/2021 she awoke in the middle of the night with intense pain in her lymph nodes on the side of her body that the vaccine was administered (Left Deltoid).   At first she was scared that she was having  more issues related to her cancer.    Oncologist conferred with his partner and determined this to be a common reaction to the Moderna Vaccine.    Notified the pharmacy at this point.   Was instructed to follow up with her doctor if symptoms did not improve.

                                                She had sudden onset of fatigue, stiffness, joint pains in her shoulders and hips bilaterally, and depression. The pain was worst in the mornings and across the shoulder girdle. These were the most severe symptoms she had ever had and they reduced her to about 50% of her usual capacity. These symptoms started much more suddenly than past joint aches and were persistent without any improvement for two weeks, leading her to seek care on 3/2/2021. This provider checked labs and referred her to specialist. I saw her on 3/17/2021, ordered a few more labs, and prescribed prednisone on 3/22/2021 for suspected polymyalgia rheumatica. She is starting to have less pain, fatigue, and depression as of 3/26/2021.

                                                20-30 minutes after the shot I started feeling tightness in my face and I felt like it was swollen. And eyes started feeling puffy especially my left one but when I looked in the mirror nothing was swollen.  About 30 minutes later I took a Benadryl.   It started feeling better but the sensation took about 24 hours to go away totally on my face and a few hours later for my eyes to feel normal.

                                                Approximately 20 to 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I had what appeared to be a seasonal allergic reaction, in which I could not stop sneezing and my eye tearing.  This continued throughout the evening and night but not as intense as when it first began.  I awoke at 1:00 AM to a very intense sneezing and eye tearing, but on only the left side of my face and eventually both sides.  I took Allegra D and did get relief.  The sneezing (allergic rhinitis) reaction continued but after almost an hour of taking the Allegra D , it was not as intense.  My face also appeared swollen but only with respect of atypical allergic rhinitis intense reaction.

                                                About five days after vaccine administration I noticed an inflammation of the area of the achilles tendon of left foot. Since I am not prone to inflammation of any sort nor did I have any strain or trauma, I took notice. I do not CHF (causing swelling of the ankles). The area of inflammation is tender, a bit red and a bit swollen. It is worrisome since I have never had anything like this in the past. I WILL NEED FOLLOW UP ON THIS. I AM UNSURE IF I SHOULD RECEIVE THE SECOND VACCINE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF SIMILAR INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES HAVE BEEN REPORTED, WHETHER IN ANKLE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BODY.  I realize that this may not be a typical vaccine reaction BUT this is a brand new vaccine, has not been time-tested, is only permitted by the FDA to be administered under these emergency circumstances. SO all possible reactions must be taken seriously and recorded. We are the guinea pigs. Also. I was handed a packet of papers when I received the vaccine. To register for v-safe the only two options given for registration were smart phone browser or QR code. I do not have a cell phone. So this leaves me out of the loop, which I think is unfair and unwise. Why can computer registration not be made available, and if it can then why doesn&#39;t the instruction sheet tell of this? In rural areas not everyone has a cell phone nor is cell service available to all areas.

                                                Moderna: one giant hive on my left shoulder; swelling, redness (approximately 2&#34;x3&#34;); extremely sore; horrible horrible itching; the center of the red spot was hard and hot.  The redness went down my arm to my inner elbow down my forearm to my wrist. The redness going down my arm was not as bad after I took the Allegra.  It was all extremely painful. I had to go see Dr. because the itching was so bad. Dr. prescribed medicine for the swelling/itching.  At times my throat was sore and my face was flushed and I had a tightness in my chest. But that did not last long.

At first thought it might be GERD but was severe and realized it may be from vaccine. Had slight mucous discharge, in throat and slight change in swallowing. Had for full week; feels like it is resolving. No difficulty breathing, O2 level 97 plus.

Then 2 small red dots appeared and over the last couple of days, the 2 red dots have swelled to about a 2 inch rectangle across the top of my arm.  The whelp is slightly warm but not hot.  I have taken benedryl at night for 2 nights and used Sarna on the whelp.  It keeps spreading and not going away.

The left muscle in my left side of my neck stiffened.  As we left the area and headed down the street I was getting anaphalactic:  numb jaw, swelling tongue, closed throat, eyes closing, inner cheeks numb - as if I was severely novacained from the dentist.  I was able to breathe ok to  get home hoping it would pass and drank wanter to keep things fluid.  I was there for one hour.  On advice, I went to the ER to get checked out.

                                                I woke up this morning with a rash at the vaccine site.  It was itchy and warm approximately 3 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.  The rash curved down towards my armpit.  I had slight swelling and soreness in my armpit.  I relayed this info to doctor and she advised that I take a Benadryl, which I did.  She also advised that I take a Benadryl before my second vaccination.  I thought it was strange for me to have this rash a week after the vaccination.  I only had slight soreness in my arm the 2 days following the vaccination, with no rash at that time until today.  The Benadryl seems to help with the itching, and the rash is lighter but still there.

                                                I developed 3 cold sores on my upper lip. I have had them before many years ago but thought this vaccine might have triggered something and you might want to be aware. Back when I first starting getting cold sores, I got very sick.  The doctor at the time told me I had herpes simplex 1. It&#39;s not something I&#39;m worried about.  I&#39;m treating it with abrevia and it is responding very well. No other ill affects were noted other than a sore arm.

At about 4 hours after I smelled smoke and dirty dish rag smell. That didn&#39;t last. Other symptoms started 12 hours after given shot. It was immediate like turning on a light switch. I slept until 5:30 the next day, 2/3/2021. Was able to eat a bit of soup and went back to sleep until next morning. I was able to go to work on 2/4/2021 but experienced some weird brain fog and fatigue. On 2/5/2021 my arm had a large red ring around injection site and hives below it. I remained fatigued and lack of appetite for 4 days or so.

                                                starting February 5, I had mild swelling in the entire left leg treated with ice and anti-inflammatories. There was no redness, swelling, or pain at injection site. Symptoms seemed to be slowly subsiding. However, Thursday 2/11/21, I had a small patch of itchy, (but not painful) red rash on back of left thigh. By Thursday evening it had doubled in size. Friday am (2/12/21) it was a little bigger still. Then by Friday after work, my entire left leg was moderate to severely swollen and the rash covered a large part of the back of right thigh and was beginning to spread to the back of left calf.  Friday evening, I visited Urgent Care. The doctor there was concerned about a possible DVT and sent me to the ER. At ER, an ultrasound revealed no DVT. At no time did I have a fever. The ER doctor admitted me to the hospital where I remained until the afternoon of Monday, February 15. During hospital stay, I was treated with IV Vancomycin twice per day. That helped quite a bit to reduce rash and swelling but it remains at a mild level. I am currently Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. I took the first dose of the oral med at the hospital on the day of discharge.

                                                ?Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA? About a week after my first dose (only immediate side effect, about 12 hours after shot, was stiff left arm/shoulder for about 3 days), I had the WORST genital herpes attack that I&#39;ve had in literally 40 years, with extremely swollen labia, excessively &#34;weeping&#34; sores, intense itching and pain. The shot was the only variable in my routine health and healthcare to which I can attribute this; the herpes attack finally began to heal, but then repeated itself, not as bad as the first one. During this time I have been taking Valcyclovir and Acyclovir cream, prescribed by OB/GYN. A few days into the initial herpes attack, my hands and face swelled and broke out in a case of (probably) dermatitis (which I&#39;ve had once or twice in the last 2 years), covering my arms, legs, hands, somewhat belly and back, with itchy hives which are still healing. Was prescribed by dermatologist Hydroxyzine HCL 10 MG 3x/day &#43; Triamcinolone Acetonide lotion USP 0.025% topical ointment, which are helping to relieve itching.

This was  accompanied by a prickling sensations.  I got a sore inside my right nostril and a cold sore on right upper lip.  The mottling and vein prominence continue intermittently still.  Improving but not resolved entirely. Along with this, my eyes became intermittently  itchy as if I had an allergic irritation. This has also completely resolved.  I spoke with a relative who is a physician  and he felt that I may have had a hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis reaction.

It appears the name for that is now, Covid arm.  Today, 2/23/2021, the redness is fading and it is only slightly itchy.    Very mild tenderness when I touch it.  Checked my temp over the last few days and it was in the normal range 97.4-97.9 (for me).

                                                One week after the shot, my right shoulder started itching at the injection site.  I absent-mindedly started rubbing/itching it through my shirt.  As day wore on (Thursday, Feb. 25), it became more and more noticeable and distracting.  I removed my shirt that evening and discovered my entire outer shoulder was swollen, inflamed, and VERY itchy.  Benadryl didn&#39;t help, nor hydracortizone cream, nor wet washcloth with soda.  I finally discovered that a &#34;rice bag&#34; from freezer brought the most relief.  Friday the redness and swelling was going away but I had to keep from touching it or it would set off the itchies.

                                                Nine days after my shot, the vaccination site on my left arm became red, a little itchy, and very warm. There also was a hard bump under the skin. The red splotchiness measured about 4 inches long and 3 inches wide. It was only mildly sore when I pressed it. I have applied cold compresses and taken ibuprofen. I have now had it for 4 days and it is starting to get better: Not as red, not as warm, and the bump seems to be shrinking. But it still is there.

                                                I was experiencing a mild RA flare w/ tendinitis going into the vaccine sequence. After 2nd dose my flare worsened to severe within a 9 day period. I had joint, muscle pain, swelling of fingers, hands. I lost much mobility, having gait issues and could not walk unaided ( a first in a flare). I do not take immunosuppressive infusions. Just NSAIDs. My doctor  prescribed a week of Prednisone. I am improving but having to build up strength to stand and walk. My flare continues but is abated. My muscles are weak.

                                                starting February 5, I had mild swelling in the entire left leg treated with ice and anti-inflammatories. There was no redness, swelling, or pain at injection site. Symptoms seemed to be slowly subsiding. However, Thursday 2/11/21, I had a small patch of itchy, (but not painful) red rash on back of left thigh. By Thursday evening it had doubled in size. Friday am (2/12/21) it was a little bigger still. Then by Friday after work, my entire left leg was moderate to severely swollen and the rash covered a large part of the back of right thigh and was beginning to spread to the back of left calf.  Friday evening, I visited Urgent Care. The doctor there was concerned about a a possible DVT and sent me to the ER. At ER, an ultrasound revealed no DVT. At no time did I have a fever. TheER doctor admitted me to the hospital where I remained until the afternoon of Monday, February 15. During hospital stay, I was treated with IV Vancomycin twice per day.  That helped quite a bit to reduce rash and swelling but it remains at a mild level. I am currently Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. I took the first dose of the oral med at the hospital on the day of discharge.

Then a small rash appeared at the injection site and it has steadily grown so not it is as big as my hand, it itches, has welts and feels warm. My lymph nodes under that arm are also tender.  I also developed a cold sore/fever blister on my lower lip.  I have not had one of those in years. I showed it to my Dr. on 3/8/2021 and she prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide to be applied 3 times a day until the rash is gone.  She suggested I go back to the facility where I had the shot and speak with them about it.  I did that today 3/10/2021 and she suggested that I take Benadryl at night.

                                                On March 9, 2021, 11 days after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, I woke with a left sore arm that felt similar to the sore arm I experienced after receiving the vaccine. As the day progressed I developed a rash beginning near the injection site that eventually spread from my shoulder to just above my elbow.  The rash is not raised, warm to the touch with mild itching. Left arm is slightly swollen.

                                                Patient had her first dose of Moderna vaccine admistered at approximately 1315 on 3/4/2021. She waited the 15 minutes as recommended and had no symptoms or concerns. She left our suite and stopped off at the restroom before she left for work and noticed that her face and nose was reddened when she took off her facial mask. She returned to our site at approximately 1340/1345 and was brought back to an exam room. At this time she complained of slight lip tingling. Dr. was asked to assess patient. No difficulty swallowing or breathing, HR 82, pulse ox 99%. No facial swelling. Glass of water offered and patient finished without any concerns. Dr. ordered 25 mg of Benadryl (patient was going to work ). She was monitored until 1430 and then  discharged at approximately 1440. No localized reaction at injection site noticed. Patient went to work and was fine until the Benadryl wore off-she did take an addtional 25 mg of Bendadryl. Upon awaking the next day 3/5/2021, her facial area was swollen and slightly reddened. She was instructed to call her PCP. Patient continued to take Bendadryl, and by Sunday 3/7/2021 she was back to baseline.

                                                several days after the vaccination, my arm was sore. I was tired. several days later my arm was still hurting and feeling swollen and itchy and hot so I go in the bathroom and I look at my arm and there&#39;s 2 large coins sized circles hooked together. they were raised up welts. my face feels puffy. my eyes feel itchy and puffy. I am taking 10 mg of Claritin daily. I am doing hot and cold compresses. my temp is low grade fever. still experiencing this reaction on 03/11/21 Doctor is going to prescribe prednisone but I do not know if I will be taking it. I am extremely tired and I find myself waking up from 4 hour naps. the arm is hot to the touch and my face feels like its on fire as well.

                                                Within 5 hours, patient was awakened from her nap but found that her eyes were swollen shut, upper lip was swollen and her gums itched.  Her head was hurting which is what awakened her.  She went and looked in the mirror, she immediately took a Benadryl 25 mg oral gel cap.  Within 20 minutes, the swelling and itching started to improve.  The symptoms resolved after taking the Benadryl.  The next day, she went to work.  She took another Benadryl at 10 AM on Friday, slept all day.  She ran errands on Saturday, took a Benadryl with her just in case.  She also carried an Epi pen.  Her feet began to swell, her hands swelled and she started itching all over.  Her throat began to close.  She took a Benadryl immediately (this is day 3).  The symptoms did resolve.   She returned home.  On day four, she had some nausea.  On day five (Monday), she went to work and her tonsils started throbbing.  She ran her bus driver route.  She was itching all over again.  She took another Benadryl . She called Dr. on day 5 after vaccination because of the recurring symptoms.  She also called her allergist.  She had an appointment with her allergist on day 6.  Family Doctor also called back on Day 5 and called a prescription in for Prednisone.  She did not start the Prednisone.  She did see the allergist on day 6. The allergist thinks her reaction might have been due to the preservative in the Moderna product.  It was the only ingredient in both the flu shot (7 years ago) and the Moderna contents.  She advised her to take the Prednisone dose pack (as prescribed by family doctor) to over-ride and she upped her Zyrtec to bid.

Now on the 15 day my face feels hot my lips feel like the are swollen and buzzy and burning my face goes in and out of feeling sunburned when it isn&#39;t.  Not sure what is going to happen

I applied cold compresses, and took Motrin and Benadryl.  The pain was so intense that I was in tears.  It would not stop.  The pain went down my arm to my hand as well.  I was unable to sleep.  The swelling has gone down, but is still present.  There is discoloration under the bottom of my upper arm, arm pit and breast.  The pain is still awful when my arm is not in use, and  increases when I do use the arm.  I reached out to doctor&#39;s office and for two weeks I didn&#39;t receive a call back from anyone at the facility following almost two weeks of calling.

                                                About 4 hours after receiving my second Covid vaccination, I began to experience chills. Several hours later, achiness began. I went to bed and by morning I felt so sick I could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I slept for most of 14 hours, plus off and on all the next day. then all the next night. I tried not to take any over the counter medication because I had heard or read conflicting information as to the effect of these medications on the vaccine. However by 11:00 AM (just over 20 hours after vaccination) I couldn&#39;t stand it any more. I took 1 Tylenol. I began to feel slightly better such that I was able to get to the bathroom and get something to drink. However, I knew exactly when the Tylenol wore off 4 hours later. I took another Tylenol with a similar result. After sleeping all night, I didn&#39;t feel much better by the next morning. At 8:00 AM (just over 41 hours after vaccination) I took 1 ibuprofen. Within an hour, I started to sweat. Within an hour after that I started to improve. Buy the end of that day, I was feeling much better, however still fatigued. The fatigue lasted most of the next week. Please note, I returned to work (online teaching from home) the next day. This didn&#39;t help the fatigue situation.  Other symptoms I noticed included a second round of Covid Arm. The 2nd vaccine was injected into the opposite arm because I experienced Covid Arm in my left arm after my first injection - see Vaers Report Temporary Number dated 2/14/21. I received  my 2nd injection in the opposite arm. This time, the rash appeared much sooner - 3 days after injection, and went away much more quickly (2 days later). This rash was not as itchy, but was also not identical to the first rash. The first time the rash was blotchy and bumpy. The second time it was more of a slightly raised red square blotch. Pictures are available if needed.  Another significant symptom was an increase in congestion and nasal drainage prominent the night after the injection and lasting through the time I began to feel better. Finally, I noticed  a temporary change in taste. Foods I enjoyed before injection tasted super-sweet for about 5 - 6 days after injection. This has resolved.

                                                Severe allergic reactions: Dizziness, tingling on my face and/or body and trembling. Wednesday: My arm started to feel slightly sore within minutes after the injection. On the drive home I felt allergic tingling in my body around the chest area on and off for a few minutes.  I had a strong headache that would come and go that evening. An existing itchiness on my scalp from an allergy response to a new shampoo and other products became inflamed with excessive itchiness and redness all over my scalp. I felt light headed, too. Thursday: I woke up to an itchy scalp and tingling on my forehead. I felt very dizzy all day. I still had a strong headache that would come and go. I was lethargic and slept in the afternoon. My arm was really sore. I woke up at 11:30 p.m. very nauseous. I was able to prevent vomiting by laying a certain way in my bed. Friday: I am still dizzy but not as bad as Thursday. My arm felt better today. My body is experiencing a tingling feeling all over. It was a very strange sensation. I still had a strong headache that would come and go.  Saturday: I had strong dizziness all day on Saturday. I felt awful. I called and reported my symptoms to Dr office. Sunday: My face was tingling in the morning. My left cheek felt puffy. My face is sensitive to touch. Monday:  I woke up at 3:30 a.m. and my lips felt puffy but didn?t look puffy. Arms and chest looked a little pink. At 10:20 a.m. my face felt tingly. I was also shaky and a little dizzy. I called the doctor&#39;s office and left a message. Tuesday:  I woke up with a headache and my scalp aching. My face felt tingly. There were some places on my face felt rough (sand papery) to the touch. I was still trembling. I had on and off dizziness. I made an appointment with the doctor for the next day. Wednesday: I had a video appointment with Dr. We scheduled me to have extensive bloodwork done the next day. I continued to experience tingling and trembling through February 27th.  I felt bad for ten days. I have had occasional tingling up to March 17th.

                                                Day 7 post-dose (first Moderna vaccine dose), woke up with swelling of both eyes, more severe around left eye (injection given in left arm), became more severe upper and lower both eyes, with redness and itching. Also some redness and itching both ears and scalp.  This progressed to jaw pain on both sides. Had bruise around injection site with a bit of pain, but on Day 10 had grapefruit-sized red swelling distal to injection site.  Began taking OTC antihistamine on Day 7 for eye swelling but swelling became more severe so went to Urgent Care center on Day 10. They recommended starting RX Prednisone 40 mg QD and RX Hydroxyzine 25 mg BID, to be started in a.m. on Day 11.  Eye swelling improved but is still present, with some itching, as of Day  18.  Redness and bruise on arm has resolved.

I felt better but when I woke up the next morning, I was worse. 3/11 painful hard lump in chin was growing larger &amp; pain was moving up the left side of my face toward my ear, so I went to the ER. Doctor did CT scan and blood work. CT showed inflammation in my chin. Blood work showed high white blood cells. I think they were eosinophils. Prescribed Keflex &amp; sent me home.

By 6:00 I had a fever and was aching all over.  I finally went back to sleep until around 9:30.  Fever broke and I ate almost all of a piece of toast, though I wasn&#39;t hungry really and couldn&#39;t taste it much.  I slept a total of 17 hours from 6:00 a.m. Saturday to 6:00 a.m. Sunday.  Still achy, feverish, and tired on Sunday.  Rested most of the day.  Monday morning I woke up with icepick headaches in the top left side of my head and the left temple.  These were frequent and intense throughout the day.  No fever but extreme fatigue and still achy in joints.  Injection site is a hard knot and is warm.  Headaches continued Tuesday (yesterday) in same locations in my head.  Still can&#39;t taste much, and now have 2 fever blisters on my lips and sores inside on the roof of my mouth.  Wednesday (today) I finally have not had any of the headaches and am slowly regaining my energy.  Still have the sore inside my mouth and can&#39;t taste food as it should taste.  Feel much better but not 100% yet.

                                                I was assuming that I breezed through the vaccine, only mild arm soreness and fatigue and then on day 9 my arm began horrible itching and was sore to touch and felt warm.  When I got home, I removed my shirt to find that I had a large rash that developed at the vaccine site.  I immediately applied hydrocortisone creme and started googling this event to find out that there was a condition known as delayed covid vaccine rash.  The hydrocortisone creme was only slightly effective, it still itched like crazy.  The next day I phoned my doctors office and asked if they could prescribe an ointment that is stronger than the over the counter ointment.  He prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide USP, 0/1%.  At first I didn&#39;t feel that the itching and swelling were subsiding but finally today, 5 days after onset, the ointment is working.  I still have the rash and it is still warm to touch but I think that it is improving. At the initial onset of the rash I started getting chills for the next few days and started feeling fatigued.  I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m  suffering from fatigue today but earlier today I  was getting chills.  It appears that   the chills are subsiding this evening.

                                                After having bad reaction to 1st vaccination, I took Tylenol and went to bed early - about 10PM - before feeling any adverse symptoms. I woke up at about 4AM to use the bathroom and felt my whole body hurting like the last time.  I took more Tylenol and went back to sleep. I slept til about noon and when I got up then, everything hurt terribly. This time more pronounced in back of neck than the last time; could not move head to look up. Also tremendous pain in  left hand area of thumb and right heel of hand. All pain continued until evening, then mostly subsided - except for the hand pains; I definitely still have those though not as bad as they were. (P.S. I&#39;ve had occasional Herpes cold sores since the 80&#39;s  (rarely)  - but since I had Covid in December 2019 and/or the vaccines, I have had 8 outbreaks, one after another (I have one now).

                                                Sore arm beginning the day after the injection and lasted for 2 days.  A second side effect occurred on January 6 - a swollen lymph node under my left arm, which was not the injection arm.  However, I had lymph nodes removed due to breast cancer in 2001..  Lymph node is normal on January 9.

The following Saturday 1/30 the same area turned red again but this time very itchy and again swollen and soar.  Went to  but nurse practitioner was confused because  said injection is given higher on the arm in the muscle area.  Not sure if this is a reaction to the vaccine.  The confusions is because it?s the same arm after the vaccine was administered, so what else could it be from.

                                                I was feeling extreme fatigue on Tuesday  02/02/21 which I felt was just a normal outcome of the vaccine, though I had shortness of breath during a workout (I workout almost daily so this was not normal). This was already 5 days post vaccine so I also felt this was beyond the normal time frame to experience symptoms from the vaccine On Wed. I had a covid test to be sure I was ok, as I work in the clinic providing vaccine, that was resulted as neg.  I continued with some fatigue through out the week. On Saturday am, I awoke to a 3?x2?  welt that was itchy swollen and hot. I contacted my MD at that point.

                                                Arm was slightly itchy, so I scratched it. Within a few hours, I looked at it and it was red and slightly raised. I experienced pain, itchiness, swelling and redness at the injection site. I emailed my doctor on 2/2/2021, and she said to take Benadryl and put cortisone cream on it. I began taking Benadryl and put calamine lotion on the site.  The itchiness, swelling and pain subsided after 2-3 days, but I still feel a slight irritation at the site and intermittent itchiness.

                                                Broke out in severe rash on 5th day after vaccination. Swollen lips, ears, upper eye lids, under both arms, under breasts and upper thighs. Terribly itchy.  Rash was raised like welts. Got worse the next day and included scalp, neck, hands, forearms and knees. Called my family medicine doc and he called in a script for MethylPredisone.  Took the first 3 pills after lunch as recommended by pharmacist.  Slept through the night and noticed the rash was not as angry looking.  I have continued on my second day doses. Have noticed the itch coming back starting around 4:15 pm today.   Have 3 more doses to take today.

ER Doctor prescribed predniSONE (20 mg) for three days, 25 mg Benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid.  ER Doctor did address lymph node swelling stating that it &#34;Looked like a bug bite&#34;.  Facial swelling, eye redness and shortness of breath resolved within a day after taking prescribed medication.  Lymph node swelling resolved within a week.  Currently still have slight redness and pain/itching at injection site.  Primary Care Physician has advised skipping second dose.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

                                                Monday 02/15/2021 a 3 inch egg shaped rash started appearing at injection site. No pain but itched. Started as a few red pimples but became red all over and swollen (possible hives?). Later in evening swollen lymph node (about 1)2 inch diameter) under chin near left ear. Felt very tender. Lymph node swelling reduced by next morning. Rash at injection remained. Has diminished in color but is still pink thru today 02/22/2021 and no more itch.  Took no action at all. Notified primary care physician Thurs 02/18/2021. Note that on Friday 02/12/2021 (prior to rash appearing) started prescription prilosec 40 mg 1 per day. Continued this thru Thurs 02/18/2021.  Discontinued prilosec after speaking with primary care physician. Don&#39;t know if this had anything to do with reaction.

                                                I have very swollen feet. It started around 2-15-2021 the swelling in my feet. I went to see my primary doctor, and they put me on Keflex 500 mg  for 10 days, it&#39;s now been 8 days &amp; I still have swelling.  I went to Emergency department on Saturday night because both of my feet were so swollen, and I was shivering, and was scared since I live alone. I was there for many hours, &amp; the dr. prescribed Naproxen for 7 days twice a day. It&#39;s a very strong medication, which I don&#39;t normally take. They gave me 1 tablet when I was there, &amp; it seemed to help a bit, so was hopeful it would help.  I&#39;ve now been taking the Naproxen for 4 days, along w/antibiotics for 8 days, &amp; my feet are very swollen today, I&#39;m very concerned. I also have a nodule in the inside of my right hand that I didn&#39;t have before. When I went to the doctor last Wednesday, 2-17-2021, I had so much pain on the ball of my feet, &amp; could hardly walk very far, it hurt so bad just to walk on the ball of my feet, even in my home.  Normally I&#39;m very active, could walk my dog up &amp; down my stairs &amp; around the large complex several times, when this happened it hurt so bad to walk, I would have to stand on my tippy toes, take my dog out, &amp; come right back in, since I work remotely.

                                                I had a routine mammogram today, 16 days after my first moderna vaccine shot.  I was told by the nurse doing the scans that I had 3 swollen lymph glands in my left armpit, which was the arm in which I had the shot.  She explained that the link has recently been made between women who have had vaccinations just prior to their mammograms and the swollen lymph glands that have been showing up on their scans.  Prior to making this discovery, these women were unnecessarily being sent for a second diagnostic mammogram based on the discovery of the swollen nodes, not realizing that this was a side effect of the vaccine.  I am thankful that I have not had to endure a false cancer scare based on today&#39;s scans but I am still very concerned about this side effect.  Had this side effect been made public, I might not have gotten the vaccine.  What else is going to turn up in the days to come?

I also had a feeling of swelling in my upper lip. No obvious visual swelling, just sensation of fullness. I have a history of angioedema, but this has been a long time ago. I just stayed at site for @ 30 minutes. Sensations stayed for more than 1 hour. I took a antihistamine when I got home. This helped and it dissipated.

Approximately half an hour after injection, she began to feel tingling in the left arm, hand, and fingers. It resolved on its own and she was fatigued that evening and went to bed early. The next day she had soreness of the arm, fatigue coming through the day in waves. On 1/7, low grade fever of 99.1, headache, and fatigue. She slept for 14 hours. From 1/8-11 she had no significant issues although she did feel slightly off balance. On 1/12, she noticed left axillae lymphadenopathy and had soreness at the injection site again, which worsened the next day. On 1/14, arm was red, swollen, and tender to touch. These symptoms persisted the next day and she began to have numbness and pins and needles of the left hand. She was given 7 days of dexamethadone and cephalexin by her PCP. She slept very poorly. The next day, the numbness, swelling, and redness were all improved. On 1/17, she continued to gradually improve and there was no swelling and only slight numbness. She did have fatigue, headaches, and insomnia.    On 1/21, she had visit with an allergist to discuss preventative measure for second dose. A delayed reaction was theorized and a preventative course of premedications was outlined. The next day, the numbness in the hand worsened and headache returned. On 1/23, she felt headache, confsuoin, anger, imbalance, pins and needles in the hand, difficulty holding a glass with one hand. On 1/24 pain at the injection site recurred. She felt there was change in her vision and hearing, nausea, vibration throughout the body, mouth numbness, and heart racing. On 1/25 all these symptoms persisted other than improvement in confusion. On 1/26-27, she had continued pins and needles in hands and feet. Still felt vision and hearing were &#34;off&#34;. She was fatigued and body felt &#34;like jello&#34;. On 1/28, she was prescribed a second course of dexamethasone as well as citalopram 20mg and diazepam. With citalopram, she had nausea, hot/cold sensations, dizziness, insomnia. She also had itching of the arm, back, leg; tremor, thirst, and pallaor. She reported symptoms to PCP and citalopram was discontinued next day. On 1/30-31 she felt disoriented at times, intermittent arm soreness, noted small abnormal bruising, hot/cold, off balance, headache, and fatigue.    Since that time, predominant symptoms have been daily headache. Wakes with left posterior dull aching which escalates through the day 5/10 but will become 8/10 if she does not take anything. She is taking ASA in AM daily with second dose around 3PM when headache recurs approximately 5x/week. Sensation in feet has normalized, but she continues to have numbness in left&gt;right hand. She feels off balance with need to specifically concentrate when walking. No falls. She also has persistent abnormal tremor of left finger. When she goes to type, she will press key 3-4 times. She feels difficulty opening water bottles, but is able to do some. She is lifting pans with both hands.

                                                I was given my first Moderna vaccination at Pharmacy on February 26, 2021.  I noticed at the time that the needle was open and not covered but didn&#39;t think anything about it.  Later that evening my arm was sore.  Knew that was to be expected.  Within 2 days my upper arm was beet red and swollen beyond recognition.  Finally after 10 days of pain I went to Urgent Care in and saw a doctor there.  My arm was indeed infected.  Doctor gave me prescription for Amoxicillin &amp; Clavulanate Potassium 875 mg.  Take one twice a day.  Was also given Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment USP 0.1% to put thin layer on arm twice a day.  Today is Monday March 8th and the redness, swelling and infection has moved down to my elbow and as far as pain is concerned it&#39;s a 5 out of 10.  It&#39;s starting to affect my fingers too.  Elbow area is now red and very swollen and HOT!  I&#39;m going to try to get into my regular doctor today to see if she can help me.  I can&#39;t sleep it hurts so bad.

                                                At 2:30 am on Friday 3/5/21 my left jaw started hurting and my lips started developing extremely fever blisters completely around my mouth and on my lips. I developed a rash on my right hand, left thumb, left hand, and forehead. I have a 1.25&#34; lump in a lymph node under my left chin. I went to an Urgent Care on 3/6 and they surmised that I was having a reaction to one of the meds I&#39;ve been on for years. On Monday 3/8/21, I went to my dermatologist and she&#39;s telling me NOT TO GET THE SECOND SHOT, because of the severe allergic reactions I&#39;m having to the FRIST SHOT.  I&#39;ve been taking steroids, doubled up on my Valacyclovir to 1000 MG/day until these outrageous fever blisters are gone and cleared up. The blisters were up to one inch x 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch. The dermatologist has me putting Aquaphor on my lips and rashes. She gave me a shot of Kenalog 80 MG. She says the lump will take over six months to go away!!!!!!!!!!! I&#39;m absolutely terrified to get the second shot and don&#39;t want to die. MORE IMPORTANTLY, what do I do now to indicate that I&#39;m fully vaccinated if I can?t take the second shot?????

                                                First day following vaccine I felt very tired with a slight headache, minor soreness to the vaccine site on my arm. That evening my cheeks started to get very red at the cheek bone. The next day, two days after the vaccine, my left cheek bone began to ache and throb. Both of my cheeks at the cheek bone are red, swollen, but only my left cheek bone hurts. I put ice on it to relieve the swelling in the pain, but it has not done much to help.

She received the first vaccination to her left deltoid, and states that she had moderate swelling at her injection site. She also reports she still has left breast pruritus, mild swelling of her left arm, mild swelling of her bilateral hands, and swelling of her bilateral legs, ankles, and feet. She also had a runny nose after the vaccination, but that has resolved. Patient was sent to ER by her PCP.

On 2/12, I had my first dose of the Covid 19  vaccine,  Moderna.   When results come back for MRI, I was informed of a single, enlarged  node and told given my breast cancer history, I should pursue further testing.  I just had a clear mammogram in Dec 2020, so it really didn&#39;t make sense.  I&#39;ve been advised by my primary to get a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound.   Not sure this is appropriate.

The next day (9 days after vaccine) my arm was red, swollen and hard, about 2 inches in diameter.  The day after that (10 days after vaccine) the swelling went down, but the redness continued to cover a larger area.  Today, 14 days after the vaccine the redness covers an area of about 3 by 5 inches. The redness is brighter around the outer edge. It is warm to touch and doesn&#39;t seem to be getting any larger at this point.

Covid arm (rash,swelling) appeared on 2/28 and patient had a visable rash on arm when presenting for second dose on 3/18/2021. On advise of oncologist that stated that it should be ok to administer the 2nd dose, I administered it while observing patient for 30 minutes in which she was fine. Did advise patient that she may have a delayed or extended reaction to the second dose and  discussed what to do in the event that a reaction did occur and patient was in agreeance.

I went back into the urgent care i had received the vaccine and they immediately took me to the ER. I was admitted and they gave me prednisone and benadryl and they gave me an epipen to take home. They sent me home and told me to use the epipen and call 911 if I couldn&#39;t breathe. My face was still swollen, red, and burning when I left the hospital. I still have the facial burning and swelling. I am putting cold compresses and taking benadryl. My neck and chest are also red and hot.

It was definitely swollen and some redness too. I took my temperature and had no fever. Called my doctor&#39;s office to report my findings. Was instructed to apply a cold ice pack on it and take ibuprofen and to contact you with my event. I did not need to visit the office and continuing to ice pack my arm and ibuprofen.  As of 3:41 pm CST it is still swollen.

                                                After receiving vaccination mid day Monday, I awoke Friday morning with slight swelling on right upper lip and surrounding cheek area. Thinking I had slept in an odd position, I went about my business. At noon, I realized that it had not gotten any better, By 3PM it was clearly more involved. I took 2 benedryl tablets.  By abour 6:30 swelling was increasing, Visited facility and Urgent Care where I was given Dexamethasone 10 mg injection IM. Prescribed Predisone 20 mg tablet x2 daily for 5 days. Most swelling resolved by Saturday morning, but slight swelling is presisting so far.

Pt has numerous documented allergies including iodine (hives, facial swelling), Shellfish Containing Products (Hives, facial swelling) and penicillin (edema). Pt initially tolerated injection without incident and was sent for post-injection observation. Within 10 minutes, pt developed acute SOB, increased WOB, wheezing, and cough. Pt also reported itching skin and scratchy throat. Provider notified and exam found pt in respiratory distress with increased work of breathing, bronchospasm and wheezing. Pt had no rash, lip swelling or vomiting. Vitals assessed as O2 sats &gt;96%, BP 140-150s/60s, HR 70-80s. Pt was administered albuterol 2.5 mg via nebulization x 2, diphenhydramine 50 mg IM and epinephrine 0.3 mg IM. Pt was subsequently transported to ED. By time of arrival, pt&#39;s symptoms had significantly improved. Pt administered famotidine 20 mg IV and prednisone 60 mg PO and placed on continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring. After complete symptom resolution, pt was discharged in stable condition. Pt&#39;s allergy profile was updated to include Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine (eua) (rxn: Anaphylaxis; severity: High).

                                                Blanching red rash, diffuse, spreading out from injection site. Began approx 2 hrs from injection. Treated with OTC Benadryl. Occasional tingling, angioderma around mouth. Disssapated after Benadryl.  Rash is gradually fading and requires less Benadryl to keep in check.  Had similar reaction to Shrinyx vaccine 2 years ago.  Rash lasted 1-2 weeks without Benadryl treatment.

On Jan 27th (7 days following vaccination) a large (2.5&#34; X 4&#34;) red area formed around the injection site on my arm and it began to ache and itch. I also had diarrhea which began in the middle of the night (2 am on Jan 28), with a total of 3 episodes over 3 hours. That day I was very tired, experienced intestinal upset  (w/ very small episodes of diarrhea) and my arm began to really ache and the swollen area became rather firm and hot. The intestinal episode is over but the hot red welt continues as of this report. Diarrhea is not a common condition for me.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna COVID 19 on 1/19/21.  One week after the vaccine, the injection site became warm, slightly red &amp; itchy, there was pain in lymph node on same site of vaccine site and fever. The fever was gone with 24 hours.   As of today the lymph node is no longer painful or swollen, however, the injection site continues to be itchy and warm.  The vaccine was Lot #025J20-2A.  Will I be able to receive my 2nd dose which is scheduled 2/16/21 since I had a reaction.

On day 6, itching starting and on  day 7 swelling started involving whole outer side of upper arm.  Contacted doctor on day 8 and was prescribed Methyprednisonal Dose Pak 4mg and Benedryl 25mg 4x/day.  Swelling started to go down within a few hours of dosing but then widespread redness appeared. The redness was mildly better but as of today, day 12, it is still there and has migrated to my bicep and actually has ridges of red swelling.

                                                On the 8th day after I had the Moderna vaccine, my left arm deltoid area (where I had the shot) developed a very red, defined area about 3 inches by 5 inches. It didn&#39;t really hurt but was somewhat swollen and felt itchy/achy. After 2 days it started to fade and now after 8 days, it is almost gone. I did not have fever or other symptoms.

During the night of day 2 I woke with my entire body trembling. My face was swollen the entire day. Today is day 3. My lips twitch occasionally, my face has an occasional tingle, still have diarrhea and nauseous, I am trying fluids and and I just tried an egg.  I feel like I have worms crawling inside my arms and legs.  I was told by the pharmacy and school nurse that it would take 3-4 days to feel better.  I am healthy and a teacher.  This is very concerning.

                                                6 days after the show on 2/6 I began to notice a soreness in my left armpit and assumed it may be a lymph node gland. The 7th day I took a jacuzzi that night and afterwards noticed my armpit more swollen and my left arm near injection site very warm and sore to the touch. After going to bed my whole left arm seemed to hurt more and into my back of neck and shoulders. Took a Tylenol PM. During the night I also felt pain in my left lower thigh but when I did finally get up everything felt better and no leg pain. However I noticed about a nickel size bruise around the injection site and about 2 inches lower a patch of red skin about 4 times that size. Non itchy. All 3 days I took temperature and blood pressure which seemed close to normal.

                                                On Wednesday, February 3, I received my first COVID vaccination shot, as a medical volunteer at a clinic.   After about three or four days, I had sensation on my left hip that felt like my skin was tingling/burning. Last Thursday, February 11, I began noticing rash like bumps in my pubic area. I thought at first that it was a chaffed place from running. But the bumps continued to spread, including at the base of my spine and my left buttock. And all of the rash is only on my left side. (Oddly, the same side that I received the COVID vaccine shot.) The bumps look like those of poison ivy. But it hurt rather than itched.   Last Saturday and Sunday, (February 13 and 14), it was at its worst, and hurt even to sit down.  Monday, Feb. 15 and Tuesday Feb 16, the rash was still prevalent, but swelling was down  but still feels uncomfortable. I am hoping that it is getting better. It appears to have very similar symptoms to shingles, but I have had both the old shingles vaccine, and both doses of the newer one. My second dose of the new shingles shot was on March 9 of last year, right before the lockdown.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA. On Feb 14, 2021, I received Moderna  011M20A vaccine at  pharmacy. I had no side effects until 9 days after the injection, when I noticed a  huge, raised, hot welt at the side of the injection, a painful and hard lymph node under my left arm, and a small symmetrical rash on my back just below the waist. I began taking Benadryl on day 10 after the injection, and the lymph node and left arm welt subsided after 48 hours of their appearance but the rash was uncontrollable. It was very itchy, sometimes pins and needles, always symmetrical, and appeared on either side of my head under my hair, more extensively all over my back, and on my inner thighs.  On Feb 24 I went into  Pharmacy , where I received my injection, and reported my reactions to the pharmacist there. The next day, Feb 25, I became so uncomfortable with my rash that I got an appointment to see my  dermatologist,  who took 2 biopsies of the rash, and when I asked if I could describe it as a &#34;bad, full body rash,&#34; her answer was &#34;absolutely!&#34; Today, Feb 26, is the first day I have no new spots or traveling rash areas, and I think I am controlling the rash with Benadryl and there is less itching today. I am worried about the side effects I might have with the second Covid shot

There was no weakness.  The next day I had transient flu symptoms (hot, nausea) and a 12 hour headache.  Within a week I had a bad flare of migratory joint pain and swelling in my knees, hips, shoulders, elbows.  The joint symptoms are somewhat better (maybe 50% or less) but have not resolved.

                                                On the 17th at 9:00 PM she started itching on her thigh, didn&#39;t think anything about it, just a rash.  Through the night it increased to the whole thigh, and a little on her abdomen, and itched all night.  The next morning is dissipated, and it kept happening for the next night and then increased.  Friday night it happened to the point that 95% of her body was covered with hives, rash, and felt like her skin was burning and pins and needles throughout the areas of the rash.   She called her doctor on Thursday morning and kept in contact them him.  Was given a prescription on Friday for Prednisone and she took that morning and Saturday morning.  Her symptoms were gone during the day but at night they would return with the itching.  She started Benadryl 50 mg on Friday.  She also used Hydrocortisone ointment through the night on Thursday.  Saturday morning her entire face was swollen.  She put a cold washrag on her face and within 45 minutes it stopped hurting her, continued with the 50 mg of Benadryl every 4 hours.  By noontime she was getting short or breath on 2/20/21 she went to the ER.They gave her Solu-Medrol 120 mg, Benadryl 25 mg IV as she had just taken a 15 mg tablet 3-4 hours before that.  Then they gave her Ibuprofen and Pepcid IV.     The shortness of breath was when she was talking, and within 4 hours she was fine.  She had markings on her legs as well.   She was wiped out by this with no energy.   She has not been able to do gardening or anything due to the fatigue.  The rash and symptoms are gone, but her energy level has not returned.  Her legs felt like jelly when she walked on 17/18th.    On Monday, 2/22/20 she stopped the prednisone and Benadryl totally.

                                                Patient called in and reported a side effect to her COVID-19 vaccine. This patient states that she received her first dose of the vaccine on 2/15/2021 and on 2/24/2021 @ approx. 4:30p she began to feel pain in the arm where her injection was given. The patient reports that within 2 hours she had excessive swelling and redness in her arm. She called in and spoke to CNP about her symptoms.  The patient also states that this morning she followed up with her PCP and was told that she was having a reaction to two stabilizers in the vaccine, Thromethamine and Thomethamine Hydrocholoride. At this time her arm was excessively swollen and the Dr. could visualize it through her clothing as well as excessive redness.    The patient denies any numbness, tingling, or skin changes (color/temp) in her arm. The patient is allergic to steroids so her the treatment regimen from her Dr. is Ibuprofen by day and Benadryl by night until the symptoms subside. The patient was also told not to take her second dose of the vaccine and wishes to cancel that appointment. Upon looking in the chart it appears that she was scheduled for her second dose of the vaccine on two separate days. I left the chart as is and will wait for further instructions.   The patient gave verbal permission to contact/speak with her PCP regarding this matter.

On 2/27 in the evening, inner thighs and arms developed a red rash with itchiness. On 2/28, went to ED  where Dr. prescribed 3 tab (60 mg total) of prednisone for 5 days.  On 3/1, rash continued to spread over entire body.  On 3/2, saw primary physician who ordered blood work.  He adjusted prednisone schedule, prescribed hydroxidine, and epipens, and requested followup status. On 3/4, rash and itchiness dramatically subsided.  Today the rash is gone.

No fever and no soreness in my arm, and I did not contact my doctor. A few days later I noticed a firm lump or swollen lymph gland in my left armpit. After a few days it gradually began to improve over a 10 day to 2 week period.  I am reporting in order to assist vaccine knowledge.

                                                I had my first shot of the vaccine on February 28th and experienced no side effects except a small bruise and slight, very slight soreness of the injection site and some swelling in my left arm where I&#39;ve had lymphedema in the past. The swelling went away yesterday but this morning, I woke up with a round (3&#34; in diameter) itchy, red hive adjacent to the site of the injection. It doesn&#39;t seem possible this could be a reaction to the vaccine (which I was delighted to receive) but I thought I should check and see. I&#39;m scheduled for the 2nd shot on the 29th of March.

This increased until Tuesday and Wednesday when the area was a raised red and hot rash, measuring 3x5 inches with  extreme itching.   A few lymph nodes in armpit swollen but not bad.  Thursday am, March 11th, the redness and heat have disappeared.  The raised rash (like tiny bumps) is much smaller in size.  Lymph nodes are no longer palpable.  Itching has decreased a lot!  No pain, no loss of arm or hand movement, only the localized  symptoms.  Itching  was the worst.  On and off cold packs helped.

By the 5th day I seem to be back to normal, however, in a week after the injection, my arm started to itch and had developed some rash in blotches in the same area where I had redness before. The next day after that, the blotches increased and formed a red and swollen roundish area the size of a tennis ball. My dermatologist prescribed Clobetasol cream to be used twice a day. During the first 2 days of applying Clobetasol, there was a significant improvement ? the itching was gone and the redness decreased by about 50%. But since that time, in spite of using Clobetasol for 10 days now, the rash and some swelling, along with being warm to the touch, is still not completely gone.

Doctors suspected heart attack. Oxygen level was 94%. A low grade fever and swollen. The next day after my oxygen was up I was discharged my oxygen has remained at 96-97% when it was previously 98-99%. I had valley fever in the past.  I was prescribed antacids and pain Morphine and antibiotics. The doctor stated that I had inflammation of the space between my ribs. I got the second shot and the symptoms were different

The puncture area had gotten red, raw looking and noticeable which however previously for days after the shot I could not  see where the shot had even been given.    Last night, 3/12/21,  I noticed a large red area on my upper arm that felt hot and appeared slightly swollen.  I got online to research the symptoms last night and discovered it looked like &#34;Covid Arm&#34; and the information said it was not serious.  This morning the redness is still there but slightly less.  I am concerned about getting my second dose because as I understand it, the second dose can cause a worse reaction.

Also to use Hydrocortizone cream 3 times a day and he also put me on Prednisone 20mg for 5 days.

Arm was 99.9 degrees.  No difficulty breathing. Tired. Treated with ice and aloe. Did not take any OTC drugs or antihistamine.  Arm still swollen today but temperature down to 98.1 and itching is just an irritation. I had no problems at all with first dose. My sister said she had itching with her first dose so I did not immediately recognize it as an uncommon reaction. I just want this reaction documented

Laid back down in bed, worse headache she has ever had and does get migraines.   She did have the size of about an egg with a rash on the arm itself.  She was disoriented, had chills and clammy, felt like she wanted to throw up but did not, fatigue.  The intense headache lasted until this morning 3/18/21.   She took 600 mg of Ibuprofen initially and then 500 mg every 4-6 hours of Tylenol, which helped.  The headache is pretty much gone, small fever, able to walk better this afternoon.

                                                I had pain and some swelling for 3 days at the site which then subsided.  On day 10, I went in to get allergy shots at my doctor&#39;s office and they saw that my arm was red and swollen so they did not give me an allergy shot in that arm.  I should tell you that I did receive an allergy shot in the same left arm on 3/15 and again on 3/18 which did not seem to cause any issues.  My left arm has been itching in the injection site location for about the past 24 hours.   The red swollen area is about 3&#34; long and 2&#34; wide and is warmer than the surrounding area.

                                                The next day my arm was very sore and I felt somewhat lethargic. 48 hours later, red, itchy rash started appearing on left forearm, then right forearm with slight swelling.   It has not appeared at the vaccination site.   Additional breakouts occurred behind left knee, up right thigh, upper right arm,  and individual spots occurred on chest and back.  The worse spots look like welts, some of the individual spots were large some areas were just small red bumps.  At this point, the inflammation has gone down, and the redness is starting to fade, leaving very dry skin that still feels like very slight bumps.  Itching still occurs, particularly at night.  I have experienced more chills without fever daily  since the injection., longer lasting than before.   This quite resembles poison oak, which I was very allergic to when a child, it would go systemic and spread all over, requiring steroid injections.

Early that evening chills, fever, body aches, headache,  &amp; dry cough that lasted most of the night.  The following day fatigue, runny nose, body aches, headache, swollen lymph node/breast area &amp; arm tenderness continued.  The third day following the shot less fatigue, but still swollen area with pain and less headache.  Today, (day 4) minor headache, injection area, under arm and side of breast is still quite tender and swollen.  Research articles (U of MN, medRxiv services, etc.) indicate a 2nd shot may not be needed?????

Didn&#39;t scratch or apply anything to it.  Took Tylenol before going to bed at 10:30PM EDT and woke up(3/26) with area mentioned above Very red, swollen and itching (more so than first discovered).  I have have applied ice pack for most of day (3/26)and swelling seems to be going down.  I am allergic to Benadryl so am sticking to just Ice on area and will probably take Tylenol again this evening.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; tingling; itching; throat tightening; problems breathing; generalized allergic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 67 years old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced events, anaphylatic reaction/anaphylactic reaction, generalized allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, tingling/parasthesia, itching/pruritis, throat tightening/throat tightness, problems breathing/dyspnoea.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 16 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch:unknown) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. After that she had numbness, tingling and itching in left side of her face, which has stayed. Then, almost immediately after shot she had an anaphylactic reaction: throat tightening and problems breathing. In the ER, they gave her Benadryl and that was enough to stop it. Now, she says the numbness is similar to being numb from going to the dentist.  On 16 Mar 2021, immediately after the shot, the patient experienced the event(s) anaphylatic reaction/anaphylactic reaction, generalized allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, tingling/parasthesia, itching/pruritis, throat tightening/throat tightness, problems breathing/dyspnoea. The event anaphylactic reaction is medially significant. So, this is a serious case.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event(s), anaphylatic reaction/anaphylactic reaction, generalized allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, tingling/parasthesia, itching/pruritis, throat tightening/throat tightness, problems breathing/dyspnoea was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67 Y/O M had a serious expected event of anaphylactic reaction and nonserious unexpected hypersensitivity, pruritus, dyspnea, throat tightness, and paresthesia.  Event onset immediately after first dose mRNA-1273. Event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The next morning I had 2 large hives ( red, hot, swollen, itchy patches) on my buttocks. They went away, but other hives appeared on my torso, arms, legs, soles of feet, rotating from place to place, until the morning of Jan. 24, day 12 post injection. During all those days the injection site was inflamed and swollen in 3&#34; circle. I had a phone doctor visit on Jan. 21, was advised to take Benedryl. I emailed further questions to my doctor.  I have a appointment with an allergist on Feb. 4, prior to receiving the second dose, Feb 10.

                                                Nine days after the injection was received an area 2 inches wide and 3 inches long around the injection site became raised, red, hard and very itchy. Patient used Benadryl to treat it. 2 days later the raised effect and hardness had gone away, however the redness spread over most of the shoulder area, and 2 days after that had spread halfway down her upper arm. The itch remained. Patient went to a previously scheduled appointment with our primary care physician who said that she had had a DAR (delayed anaphylactic reaction) and should not get the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                7 days after receiving vaccine I noticed itching at the injection site.  Upon further inspection I saw that my left deltoid had become red, hard, swollen, hot, itchy and painful. This is day two since onset of symptoms, my arm is still red, swollen, warm to touch, itchy and aching but is no longer hardened. I have taken nothing for the symptoms.

                                                I felt foggy and disoriented and tired within a half hour of receiving the vaccine.   I felt pain in my arm traveling to my underarm.  After an hour I felt like the inside of my skin was prickly and tingly, my face was flushed and burning.  I was so tired I had to lay down.  I just stared into space.  There was ringing in my ears.  My heart rate was a good 20 beats per minute faster than normal.  By bedtime, my face was slightly swollen and I was unable to read because the letters were jiggly.  I had a traveling headache from the side to the top of my head through my eyes.  My breathing was more rapid and shallow.  I felt intermittent chest tightness. And pain.  The next morning, I felt better, but the prickly skin continued and my chest and back were  sore.  I had intermittent cramping in my feet and was sore in my joints.  My arm was very tender.  I was still tired and my heart rate was still elevated.  I did not sleep well and got up frequently during the night to walk around.  By the third day the prickly skin was almost gone, but I have had cramping in my chest and feet.  I am very tired.  I still have an occasional traveling headache.

                                                Patient awakened in the morning with pain and swelling in the right knee with marked tenderness laterally and local swelling in the same area.  Over the next 12 hours she developed a moderate synovial effusion of approximately 20 cc with pain in the knee becomeing generalized and had trouble walking and decreased range of motion consistent with the effusion. .  The pain seemed to subside somewhat later in the day but she still had trouble walking.  On the second night of 2/6/2021 she was able to sleep but had continued discomfort, swelling and difficulty walking on 2/7/2021.  The pain became even worse during the night of 2/7/21 and she was unable to sleep.  In the early morning  she took 5 mg hydrocodone and got some relief.. She continued to have pain and swelling through the day.  By the evening of 27/21 she was somewhat better.  The morning of 2/8 21 she awakened with less pain, less effusion, and was able to walk better.  She slept well that night.  On the morning of 2/9/ she awakened with no pain.  The effusion was gone and the knee felt stiff but no longer was painful.  By afternoon she was walking without pain and complaining of slight stiffness.    The only other side effect was pain at the injection sight for 2 days which was mild to moderate.  The R knee never felt warm and was never red.  .  I have an infrared camera and the temps recorded on the right knee were no higher than the left knee.  No other joints were involved and she had no recent right knee injury.  No chills, fever, nausea or other problems.  No headache, No myalgias. No vision or auditory prob.ems.  The sense of smell remained normal.  She is my wife and I was considering getting a CBC, Sed Rate, C-reactive protein and possibly an arthrocentesis and evaluation of the fluid.  Since she improved markedly and quickly no tests were done.  I will report any follow-up problems.   It just seemed very strange to have a painful swollen joint with no redness or warmth that was fairly severe and then almost totally resolve within 24 hours between the 3rd and forth day.  .

A few days after that my blood pressure was going lower than normal and I felt dizzy, so I reduced my blood pressure medication and kept an eye on it. I also had a huge a lump in my arm and my whole arm was sore. It was red and hot to the touch.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine I awoke with itchiness around the injection site, but saw no rash.  Two days later there is a 5 cm diameter reddish area with a rash and swelling that is warm to the touch.  I hope this does not prevent me from getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine!

By the time that she looked in her rear view mirror her face was swelling up.   Her face started to burn, fast heart beat, and dizziness.  Her neck started to burn as well.  She looked at the side effects.  She called her doctor and took 2 Benadryl as she recommended, and took a nap.  Her doctor told her to continue taking the Benadryl and to call us to report the reaction.  She still has the swelling and the burning sensation in her face, and is still getting a little dizzy but it comes and goes.  The fast heartbeat comes and goes as well.

On 1/16/21, she had a significant local reaction with redness, swelling, warmth, &amp; fine, itchy rash.  In two days time, it had extended 3/4 of the way down her arm. She went to her local Clinic &amp; received antibiotics (cephalexin x 10 days) &amp; a Medrol dose pack.  She is not convinced the medications helped.  After about a week, the redness and swelling suddenly went away.  Her arm still itches.  She received her second dose of Moderna vaccine in the opposite arm and also developed the same reaction about 2 days later but not as red or as hot.

                                                A few days after I received the first Moderna vaccine, after I was out in the cold with gloves, bumps and swelled areas appeared on the fingers of both hands, on the bottom side (palm side). This had never happened to me before. These lesions persisted for a few days ie probably less than a week, and some of the bumps became raw at the tops before healing. They went away but have reappeared twice since, at least once on what appeared to be exposure to cold (with gloves). My latest batch appeared this past Thursday and is still evident although it is fading. It has affected primarily my right hand, on both the top and bottom sides of the fingers and also one small red spot on  the top of the hand.

Within 6 hours of the shot the injection site was swollen, red, sore, and itchy. By the time I went to bed, about 11 hours after the shot, I was exhausted, very itchy, had a headache  and chills, and had a very  sore arm. Took 2 Tylenols and that helped the chills and headache. When I awoke this morning I was so tired that I went back to sleep after having coffee. No headache, no chills but my arm is still swollen, red, and very itchy.

                                                Eight days after receiving my first vaccine I experienced soreness in my left arm.  The next day at approximately 4:30 pm  my left hand started to visibly swell and continued to swell for the next several hours until I could barely remove my rings. My right hand started to swell at approximately 5:30pm and by 8 pm both hands were extremely swollen where I could not close them due to pain and swelling.  Into the next morning and for 2 more days I also experienced sore joints in my ankles (no swelling) and extreme fatigue. The swelling started to subside  on the third day (yesterday) and today my hands are back to normal with a bit of joint pain in the fingers. No more fatigue or joint pain in ankles today  (4th day) .  When I received the vaccine on Tuesday, February 16 I experienced about 3 days of soreness in my left arm, very little fatigue and I had chills for about an hour the evening of the 16th.  After those 3 days I felt fine.  Since the vaccine I have stayed home and have not injured myself nor have I been bitten by anything to have caused the extreme swelling of my hands 9 days after the first vaccine.

It kept growing  &amp; I had itching in hands &amp; side too.  Began cold pack.  Redness grew to 2x3&#34; &amp; red was no longer a circle.  Thurs the 18th red was 4x5&#34; oval.  Felt like a bee sting all the time.  Area felt warm. Fri 19th to Dr &amp; prescribed 5 day Cephalexin in case infection as I have 2 artificial hips.  Redness decreased, but swelling still there.  Redness grew &amp; decreased and grew.  Finally on the 25th it seemed more like what you would expect if you just received the vaccination.  Coldpacks may reduce swelling &amp; showers increase redness. March 1st I had a cytoscope to check for bladder infection &amp; was OK.  Given one antibiotic pill.  Arm still felt like bee sting.  Today, Thursday is just a bit of redness, still a small knot, &amp; a visible swelling.  All much less.  An ache in my arm, but may be orthopedic related? as I have had a broken arm there years ago.  It&#39;s much better, but still not back to normal.

                                                3/2/21:  I noticed my face was red/flushed for about 4-5 hours beginning in the afternoon (@2:00 p.m.). After my shower in the evening (@8:00 p.m.), I noticed a swath of red on my left arm, approximately 4 inches by 2.5 inches.  It was well defined.  The swath was warm, slightly raised, but did not itch.  The swath of red remained but began to fade slightly after about 3 days, although it is still there today, 3/7/21.

I just noticed it today and don&#39;t really know when it started, but i know for sure it was not within the first 3 or 4 days after injection because at that time i was checking my arm daily.   As of now i have not seen a doctor as i read news reports that this is not a rare or harmful occurrence.

                                                Sunday, the day of the shot, I was quite dizzy a couple of hours after the injection and my arm at the vaccination site was itchy, but no other significant reactions. The following morning I awoke to a very swollen, hot,  red, and rashy-looking upper left arm at the site of the injection. Had a bit of diarrhea twice in the morning. My temperature 100.4 which is 3° higher than normal for me.  Later that afternoon, I got dizzy again so I took my blood pressure and it was 90/59 which is low for me.   I had been eating normally even though I had a feeling of unease.  The most concerning thing was the discomfort in my upper arm and the swelling.  It was very localized and looked as if my arm had swallowed a tennis ball.  Itchy, red, hot, and very tender.  Today is Day 4 and the swelling has subsided but still not entirely gone and it is still quite warm.  I&#39;ve been applying cold compresses and taking some Tylenol.

                                                Began with stabbing pain in left shoulder that woke me up every 2 hours all night long. Progressed to massive migraine headache in a wide band across my forehead.  Found fluid pooling in a channel from my armpit past my elbow; rubbed on it and raise arm until it went away. Muscles in left arm stopped working; couldn&#39;t move my arm; put left arm in a sling.  Started feeling like I was burning up with fever, but body temperature was normal 98.8 degrees. Several hours later was having sudden chills and found body temperature had risen to 102 degrees F.  Developed high blood pressure for me. The lymph node in my neck were swelling, armpit tender to touch, and left breast tender to touch too.  Started icing the back of my neck to take down temp. Put ice on my shoulder to try to cool the pain.  I was very frightened and worried that: (1) got sepsis bacterial infection from shot (2) got bad lot of Moderna or (3) Moderna vaccine sat out at room temperature too long and had gone bad.  48 hours after the 2nd dose and after icing, symptoms started to ease.

                                                I received the vaccination on Thursday, February 25, 2021  My arm was slightly sore, but nothing terrible.  However, on Friday, March 5, my arm began to itch.  Originally, I thought it was a mosquito bite.  I began to suspect it was the vaccine when my arm became red and the swelling was much larger than a typical insect bite.  The itching, redness, and swelling went down after a couple of days and began turning into a dry rash.  However, last night, March 10, it began to itch again and the swelling and redness are even more pronounced than it was before.

                                                Sore arm that lasted 3 days. Headache the next morning; better by afternoon. A cold sore developed around the first of March (about 2 weeks after getting vaccine) and has lasted about 1 and a half weeks. Treated with Abreva. I have had cold sores before, but very occasionally. I am wondering if there is any association of cold sores (herpes simplex appearance) with the Moderna vaccine.

The injection site swelled and the lymph nodes in both arms swelled and were painful.  Especially in my right arm pit where I had lymph nodes removed at the time of my breast cancer.  I applied ice packs to the swelling at the injection site and just bore through the rest.  My arm at injection site was sore for a couple of days as well as the right side lymph nodes.  The joint pain and mouth pain subsided on its own over night and was fine the next day.

Reaction is a flushing and swelling of the facial cheeks that continues through the present, which is March 17th at 10:30 am. It has been 13 months since a minute amount of filler was applied to face (half a syringe). Redness is not in the exact location as filler was applied. Nurse who applied filler doesn&#39;t think the filler could be the cause of the reaction. Thinks it must be an allergic reaction. Patient also had brief chills 30 hours after receiving 2nd dose. No adverse reaction to 1st dose.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Patient presented to ED on 3/14/21 with new onset of inability to walk. Recalls not feeling well on 3/4/21 after receiving her COVID-19 vaccine (1st dose) on 2/21/21.  She began to experience aching over the anterior thigh on the following day that progressed to involve the posterior lower extremity and forearms by Saturday, 3/6/21.  She also began to experience numbness and tingling in the feet and fingers at that time.  The sensory symptoms persisted over the following days in association with lower extremity weakness that culminated in a fall at home on Thursday, 3/11/21.  She was unable to walk without assistance at the time of her presentation.  Initial examination in the ED revealed borderline antigravity lower extremity strength and absent lower extremity reflexes.  A lumbar puncture performed on 3/14/21 revealed protein  218.1, glucose  76, WBC  8, and RBC 1. She was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome and received her initial dose of IVIG that evening. She has noted some interval improvement in lower extremity muscle strength since her admission to the hospital.  The pain that she had been experiencing is less intense, though she is still prone to experience discomfort if she remains in the same position too long.  She is continuing to experience tingling in the feet and fingers.  She is not experiencing any shortness of breath or difficulty with chewing/swallowing.  She is not experiencing any urinary bladder dysfunction.  She is experiencing constipation.

                                                Left supraclavicular adenopathy.  Mobile 1 cm  soft lymph node palpation and may have 2 smaller lymph nodes behind it.   I honestly don&#39;t think this is an adverse reaction, just a vaccine side effect.  However, enlarged lymph nodes in this area of the body do tend to cause some concern for more serious underlying illnesses, so I thought it was worth reporting so that if this is a common side effect, other health care providers can be made aware so that patients can be educated to expect this.  Thanks.

Thursday 3/18 around 6pm I felt a pain on the outside my left arm about 5 inches above my elbow, it shortly turned into a group of small pimples,  Friday 3/19 again around 6-7pm I felt a pain on my left shoulder above where I got the vaccine which turned into a group of small.  Saturday 3/20  again around 7pm I felt a rather sharp pain on my inner left arm which turned into small pimples.  Today the upper left side of my body itches, the first group of pimples is now swollen and red, the left shoulder is bumpy and red, and my inner arm is still raw and and looks like pimples.  I also had a 4-5&#39; X 3&#34;hive on the left side of my chest which has since dissipated.

                                                After the first inoculation I had some transient pains in my head, and a few hive like welts, some tiredness.  Then I had the second inoculation.  The morning of 3/11/21 I woke up sweating with a fever and this very strange feeling was rolling through my body, from my head, down to my toes, then back up to my head and on and on.  I took my temperature and it was 100.5 F. Also, I had begun breaking out in a few hive-like red welts on my legs, arms, stomach, back,  maybe 8 to 10, hard to tell,  but strange looking, unusual,  and uncomfortable.  Then around that Wednesday, the 16th, my urine was brownish and smelled smoky.  I had not taken any supplements in days. The next day it was beige, smoky, then the next day bright yellow.  The next day it went back to normal. More welts.   EXTREME exhaustion.  Then  on  the 18th I developed chills and more itching and welts. One on my face.  One or two on my scalp.  More around my waist, arms, neck, and legs.  I am still having intermittent chills and hives/welts, and EXTREME  tiredness.  I have a cold sore in my mouth or throat, I can&#39;t tell exactly where.

                                                Sunday morning woke up with swollen checks (cheekbone areas)  in the same areas as having received Juvaderma Voluma fillers on June 16, 2020.  The right cheekbone was more swollen than the left but there was also a pocket of fluid under the right eye.  The areas were very tender to the touch.  Iced the areas for several minutes and called both Dr.&#39;s office and the pharmacist and both told me to take Benedryl, which I did.  Has not helped.  Swelling remains as of Monday morning and the fluid under the right eye feels hard like a knot.  Seeing Dr.  this afternoon.

                                                Swelling on left side of neck noted on 3/2/2021 which continued to enlarge to a hard lump with with difficulty eating and swallowing. Saw Dr on 3/5/2021. Antibiotics and prednisone prescribed for diagnosis of sialadenitis.  Took theses medications which reduced the swelling and hard lump but started to experience acute pain throat , chest and stomach when eating.  Actually was unable to eat solid food for the acute pain and could only sip small quantities of tepid fluid. On 3/8/2021 went to MD and diagnosed with esophagitis and was prescribed Pantoprazole 40mg. It took another week before I felt like eating anything. Had little energy and loss of taste for food.  I have never had any of these problems before and do not wish to take the second vaccine injection.

                                                Got the vaccine, and about 24 hours later she started to feel an ache in her front left tooth.  She was wondering if this was due to the vaccine or not.  She was unable to lift her arm as well.  In a couple of hours it was real sore and she kept hitting it with her tooth.  Her upper gum was then tender and could not touch it.  She then could not chew on the front left tooth, and even hurt with touching of her tongue.  As the night progressed more teeth were tender, and the lip was also more tender.  She started to get a headache and then all of her joints were starting to hurt.  The next morning, Friday morning she had no energy at all, just felt terrible.  Her face was now swollen, as well as her upper lip.  That night it was getting worse adn worse and her gums were so itchy and all the teeth on the left side felt loose.  It then reached her jaw and then the swelling went to her eye.  She called her PCP, and put on antibiotics, to take a antihystamine and a steroid.  Told her to go to the ER if it did not gete better.  It was horrible by Monday morning, she went to UC and had an abscess in her tooth.  They put her on penicillin, told her not to take the other antibiotics.  By Tuesday morning the swelling had gone down, and the swelling in the gums were also gone, and the teeth were also better.  The abscess was also feeling better.  She had no issues with her gums and teeth prior to this.  By the time she finished the penicillin she was fine.  She went to the dentist and they could not find anything wrong with her, and informed her that it was proof that the vaccine was doing it&#39;s job.

                                                At first my right arm became red, swollen and sore. The area measured about 3&#34;X 3&#34;. That was on March 16th. I called my primary doctor on Wednesday, and he recommended ice for 20 min on and off followed by heat. It remained that way until the 18th when the swelling went down and an itchy rash appeared and I called the doctor again and he recommended cortisone cream. The rash went away and then a 3&#34;X 3&#34; row of dots encircled the area disappearing about two days ago.

                                                Second vaccine on FRIDAY and left arm was sore later that evening.   SATURDAY I slept a lot.  I couldn&#39;t drink water as it made me nauseated.  I developed a headache in the early afternoon followed by nausea.  Movement nauseated me.  I managed three spoonfuls of soup and one piece of buttered bread. SUNDAY I felt better and was able to finish my soup and two slices of buttered bread.  Still very sore. MONDAY I noticed a slight rash on the left side of my neck that had crawled up to my jaw and ear. It didn&#39;t itch so much as it felt like the sensation of novocaine wearing off.  Also noticed what appeared to be a rash on the back side of my armpit and a hard lump.  I seemed to have some lack of balance - maybe from the rash that had gone into my ear. TUESDAY I noticed the rash had also claimed the right side of my neck and jaw though not as pronounced. FYI: I chose the Moderna because my 95 year old mother was given that vaccine and had only a sore arm - both times.  I figured if I choose the Pfizer and had an adverse reaction she would tell me &#34;You should have chosen the Moderna!&#34;  Well, I chose the Moderna and look what happened!! :-D

Went to the ER and was diagnosed with CHF because my feet were so swollen and was given lasix and released.  I continued to feel bad so on that Sunday 1/3  I went back to the hospital and was admitted and tested positive for COVID-19. I spent from Sun-Wed in the hospital

Wed 1/20 at bedtime took Benadryl 25mg.  Thurs 1/21 swelling less on L arm, less itching, still red with some rash.  Lymph node smaller.

Saw my primary physicia and she was unsure what was happening. We agreed to monitor the arm and call if it got worse or I had other symptoms.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 vaccine EUA- Patient came to the pharmacy on 1/30/21 at 9:15am. Her left arm was red, itchy and swollen. The red area extended 5.5&#34; wide and 3.5&#34; tall. Patient states that this began on Monday 1/25/21, 5 days after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was getting red and bigger each day. I marked the margins with pen and told her she needed to see her primary care doctor or go to an emergency care center as I was concerned about it being possible cellulitis or an allergic reaction. I also wrote her a note to have her doctor make a determination if she should receive the second vaccine if this was an allergic reaction, and if so, if she should have it in a hospital or doctors office better equipped to handle a severe allergic reaction if one was to occur. She was able to see a Nurse Practitioner at her doctors office. He prescribed Cephalexin 500mg three times a day and took pictures of her arm. NP told her he could not tell if it was cellulitis or an allergic reaction. The &#34;clinical visit summary of today&#39;s visit diagnosis&#34; was &#34;cellulitis of left upper limb, adverse effect of vaccines and biological substances&#34;. NP was going to forward the picture and information to her primary doctor Dr. She was told that Dr. would be contacting her on Monday or Tuesday and would make a determination if she should receive the second dose in the Moderna series and if so, if she would have to have it in a hospital type setting.

Main issue- I went for scheduled mammogram and  breast ultra sound (Jan 26) and 2 axillary  lymph nodes were enlarged. (same side as injection). Biopsy was suggested a week later. When I went a week later the nodes had gotten smaller almost normal so no biopsy was needed. It was attributed to the vaccine.

                                                I had a possible reaction on my Left arm and chest. My Right arm received the injection. I never have any sticks in my left arm since I have  developed Lymphedema post breast cancer mastectomies and treatment in  April 2006. When I arose  my effected arm was red in color, with a rash on top of that. It was hot to the touch and swollen and stiff.  My husband took me to the emergency room of the hospital named in Item 21 and later that day I was admitted to the hospital. They diagnosed it as a severe infection, resulting in cellulitis and started me on round the clock IV antibiotics.

No symptoms initially, then noticed redness, swelling hardness, warmth to touch, mild to moderate pain and itching on right arm.   Over several days, took 2 Tylenol at bedtime to ease symptoms.   I scheduled a visit with PCP on 1/27/21 but cancelled it because arm felt somewhat better.   However, even today, I feel a mild tenderness in the arm and down to the right wrist.   Redness is faint,: itchy if I scratch or irritate it.   I have not contacted my PCP about this yet.

Second day:   Upper arm down to elbow more painful,  But pain in hands and fingers completely gone. But that night after undressing, I had swelling, warmth and redness traveling down my upper arm in a diagonal 2 inch line.     Third day:   The swelling and redness had subsided, but still there a little in the morning.  I could also see where it had traveled more down my arm in the night.   Pain is almost gone.  Fourth day:  Arm is still a little sore, but otherwise I feel ok.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.    I got my vaccine at 3:00 on February 11. My right arm was a little sore for about 24 hours.( but not as sore as when I got my flu shot in October.)  On Friday night the following week, I was on the couch watching TV and suddenly my upper right arm started itching.  I felt it, and there was a bump there, maybe an inch in diameter. I first wondered if maybe it was associated with the Covid vaccine, but it was a little lower on my upper arm than where I got the shot, and I assumed any reaction would occur shortly after I got the shot, not 8-9 days later.  I decided it was probably a bug bite. It still itched somewhat the next morning.  The itching went away later that day but the bump remained until the following day. (Sunday)  I didn&#39;t think anything about it until my husband told me yesterday that 2 friends recently had a similar delayed reaction after getting their Covid shots.  Today I did some research online that discussed &#34;Covid Arm,&#34; and I wondered if maybe that was what happened to me.   I looked at the paperwork I received with my vaccine and it suggested either calling or emailing the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.  The reaction wouldn&#39;t prevent me from getting my second shot, but I thought it important that I report what happened.

Joints in my knees, hips, shoulders, and wrists were painful to the point that movement is limited. There is no pattern as to where or when the pain strikes. Usually the pain remains from 24 to 48 hours before it abates. Stiffness, pain, and swelling not helped with NSAIDS or heat. I did not have this severe joint pain before I had my initial Moderna vaccination.

The next day my lymph nodes in my neck and throat area were swollen,  it was in my neck and my front left side of chest area. I had a sore throat. I went to the ER on the evening of the 19th. They checked my vitals and they did not think it was a reaction to the vaccine, it was my body&#39;s response to the vaccine. They said I could take Tylenol or Ibuprofen and Benadryl if I needed to. As of today the swelling went down and I feel fine.

                                                Sore arm began a few hours after shot with  a hard swollen area about 3-4 inches in diameter. The other symptoms began during that night about 2 a.m. and continued throughout most of the next day:  nausea and vomiting (early morning only), severe headache, severe body ache...all over. Second day after shot - arm soreness and swelling is still here but with reducing  intensity. All other symptoms seem to have subsided....thank heaven!  I took Goodies powders for headache and body ache after eating a piece of white toast. Took every 4 hours throughout the day which seemed to help but felt bad enough to continue taking until  end of day.

They included (fever, head-ache, vomiting, chills, muscle pain, joint pain, swelling and extreme pain in my lymph nodes.  Let me note that I am 69 years old with no health conditions. I am not on any medication and in perfect health.

                                                After a week my arm started itching badly and swelled up.  I had a red rash down the arm from the site of the vaccination to almost the elbow.  My arm was very hot and red.  I started taking Benadryl and am still taking it. The rash is still there but not as bad as it was.  Wondering about the the second dose?

                                                A bandage size bruise was revealed the evening after I received the vaccine and removed the bandage that had been placed over the injection site. My arm felt sore as expected. The odd thing about the bruise is that it stayed the same size and color for at least 3 weeks after the injection. At about the start of the 4th week, the bruise has started to resolve although it is still visible. The initial pain from the first dose was minimal and there was slight swelling that went away in a couple of days. No other remarkable symptoms to report, just a bruise that took a long time to resolve. Size of the bruise was about 3 inches long by 1/2 inch wide.

She took Ibuprofen for the symptoms.

By noon I was experiencing a feeling of total body aches and nothing would take the aches away. I finally took 3 advil and the aches went from horrible to tolerable. My left arm though felt very hot to the touch and it was swelling and very red. It swelled all the way to my elbow. There was a definite distinction of where the redness and swelling started and stopped. 3/5/21 the fatigue was also a problem. Any activity was debilitating. My upper arm was swollen and red all through Sunday (3/7/21) evening. Monday (3/8/21) morning it was starting to go down.  At 5:00 pm on Monday, it is still slightly red and warm to the touch.

She went in to see her PCP and was provided cortisone for the swelling. Advised patient to continue to follow up with PCP and that we will report this to VAERS. Also advised patient  she can be seen for her second dose at one of the PH clinics and it should be given in the opposite arm.

When I phoned my doctor&#39;s office they recommended antihistamines and NSAIDs.  I took antihistamines a couple times and one pain pill.  I took a photo of the swelling just in case.  The symptoms are subsiding. Note: I get a flu shot every year and typically only get a small amount of soreness the next day, which goes away in a day or two.

She described it as the feeling of being numb from getting dental work done. This symptom went away the next day and she was not sure if it was from the vaccine, so she proceeded with dose two. Overnight after her second dose she had the same reaction as well as a fever of 100.4 overnight, she called be about 3pm today 03/12 to let me know, and states she is feeling better. I advised her to get rest and drink plenty of fluids and if it gets worse to get medical attention. I also encouraged her to do V-safe with CDC which is included in her paperwork.

                                                About 15 minutes after receiving the injection my nose started to itch a little.  It was so minor I was not concerned.  By 40 minutes after the injection when at home I was itching significantly all over my body.  My tongue was red, sore, and swollen.  My mouth and throat were red and sore.  I was having some trouble swallowing and hoarse.  I developed a cough.  I felt very tired and my hands, feet and face were swollen.  Maybe about 50 minutes after the injection, my chest was feeling tight like the start of asthma.  I used a Breo ellipta (100mcg fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 25 mcg inhalation powder.) Maybe 30 minutes later I was breathing better.  As the other symptoms worsened I took benedryl by mouth.I had an epipen, but I did not use it.  I awakened in the night and my joints (hands, knees, feet) were very sore and swollen.  I had a mild headache and lower back ache.  The other symptoms persisted except for the trouble breathing.  The  symptoms have, except the trouble breathing,  continued throughout the day after the vaccination but milder. However the fatigue and joint pain and swollen hands, feet, and face are still moderate.  I am considering taking another benedryl. I sent a non-urgent message today (the day after the vaccination) to my doctor describing what happened and what I did.  We had discussed precautions prior to the vaccinations because of my allergies.

Arm and slight body ache noticed around 3:30 am the following Friday. Severe chills and body aches began around 11:45 am Friday morning followed with a 101.7 fever around 12:30 pm.  Took 1 aspirin and by around 3:30 or so chills subsided and the fever broke.  Soreness and redness began taking place the next day, Saturday, early morning.  Rash-like itching and swelling began the following Sunday morning around 6 am.  I rubbed my arm periodically with ice.  Redness and itching continued Monday, used more ice.  I took 2 Benadryl tablets around 9 am Monday. Redness and swelling are down but slight itching remains this morning and I&#39;ve just taken 1 Benadryl tablet.

She then went home and in the evening had fatigue and a little aching all over  The next day she had the fatigue again and then it subsided and able to get up and do things around the house.  Then about 2 weeks later she had a bump/lymph node to pop up under her arm, which continued and swelled until it had a core on it.  It then popped on 3/17/21 and now it&#39;s open and draining and has a padding to keep it from ruining her clothes.  It is hard to touch, but the soreness has gone away.   She did put Neosporin on it, and a cotton ball, but it is trying to go away and is probably going to have to go to the UC for FU.

                                                Approximately 20 hours after vaccination, my mom&#39;s arm began to swell and turn bright red. Approximately 48 hours after vaccination, it had swollen to about twice the normal size. Around the vaccination site was a bright red, somewhat raised circle approximately 8&#34; in diameter. It was extremely itchy. This lasted for about 5 days before beginning to subside into what looks like a huge round bruise. There was also significant muscle pain in the arm. The rash is still visible now, one week after vaccination, but the itching has subsided. I have a photo if needed.  My mom had a similar but less pronounced reaction after her first dose on 2/14/2021. The symptoms lasted about 2 weeks before subsiding completely.

                                                First day after the shot my arm was a bit sore and I had a slight headache that went away in a few days.  Nine days later in the evening my arm swelled beneath the site of the shot and became feverish, swollen and hard. I had no bodily fever. I took some benedryl after about an hour, but that did not help. The next morning the arm looked and felt the same with a persistent dull ache and in addition to the redness on top of the arm  underneath was also red and I have a small lump on my bicep.  I also woke with a headache and took ibuprofen. That helped to relieve the hard swelling in the arm.  I saw a physician at my provider&#39;s office who instructed me to monitor it and if it worsens to return. I am due to have a booster on 2/9/21, but a bit reluctant at this moment.

                                                Next morning (1-29-21 Friday) after shot, was very tired feeling, as morning progressed got colder and colder (put on sweatshirt, jeans, socks, houseshoes and turned up heat).  by noon, took a tylenol 500mg and went to bed. Slept for 3 solid hrs. Ate a small lunch. After about an hour and half (5 pm) took another tylenol and went to bed again. Slept till after 8. Still felt tired , arm sore.  Upon taking a bath, removed shirt and saw my arm was red and swollen from shot area down till middle of arm. (did take a pic with phone). Took another Tylenol and went to bed, sleeping all night but discomfort on that arm when rolling over. Next morning swelling had progress till elbow and seemed to be traveling downward. Saturday morning, Did not take anymore Tylenol.  No worse pain/discomfort, in fact had a little more energy (took pic that evening).  By evening the redness again had traveled downward to middle forearm and became concerning as I thought it should be getting better. Still felt tired and not quite myself.  Loss of appetite, but still had sense of taste and smell. Sunday morning , still red and progressed a little further. Felt tired took a good nap.  Monday morning, still red but appears to be lessening and progression down arm stopped. Went to Pharmacist for her to look at and alert of possible side effects to other people being vacinated.  Tue. redness subsiding.

Red blotches developed under my arms, across my belly and around my sides, into the crease of my thighs and on my thighs, with small bumps.   Throat was tight. Fingers visibly swelling. Video call with Dr. resulted in Rx 40 MG Prednisone 1/day for 4 days.  Increased Symbicort to 2 puffs/2x day, and told to swallow air. Zyrtec 2x day. Benadryl 1-2 every 4 hours.  Took 1 20mg Prednisone  at 5p in hopes of sleeping, rest as prescribed. Saturday took all meds at 6am.  Had blotches, itching, but reduced within 2 hours.  Took 1 Benadryl only, but increased to 2 T 1p because blotches and rash on belly were returning.  Took evening meds at 6 p, and, 1 Prednisone 20mg at 11 because again blotching and rash including near knees.  Sunday was up at 3a because of Prednisone, no itching.

No other side effects until Day 7 I awoke to an itchy patch that was &#34;hot&#34; and inflamed.  It quickly turned into a rash - almost like a burn where skin became &#34;bubbly&#34;.  It worsened on Day 8 (Sunday) and now day 10 post injection and arm is still a bit swollen and rashy.  Do not know if upset stomach is also a side-effect however, having acid reflux more than normal!  Using Triamcinolone Acetomide Cream on dermatitis

I have put a cold pack on my arm 3 x a day, the swelling has gone down, but the rash and fever is persistant.

At the initial visit, the provider thought the patient had cellulitis.  Therefore a course of 7 days of Keflex was given. Patient finished her antibiotic and those symptoms still persisted. She came back to her primary care with still mild erythema and warmth of the left lateral arm.  At this time, her doctor diagnosed her with a local reaction to the COVID vaccine  and the patient was sent home with triamcinolone which she had.

I took a Benadryl and applied Benadryl cream on the patches.  It got better in approximately two days with some residual discoloration.

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

I could not sleep or lay down. I had to pack my upper arm with ice for 72 hours. I have had flu shots before and never had a painful reaction that brought tears to my eyes for 72 hours.   I don&#39;t know what size the needle was used on me, but it almost felt like it hit the bone. I am a thin person.  It probably did not hit the bone, but it felt like the fluid was forced into the muscle. My husband did not have this same reaction, so I don&#39;t know if it was the person who gave the shot, or wrong needle size or what made my arm hurt like it was hit with a hammer.  I now have slight itching at the shot site and there is a bump the size of a mosquito bite.

                                                My feet began to significantly swell roughly 4 hours after receiving the vaccine. While swollen, the skin on my toes, feet and ankles was very tight and the appearance was bloated and almost the color of red beets. Additionally, the edema was very apparent and frightening, and I could barely walk.  The symptoms had essentially disappeared completely by 07:30 the next morning.

Bright red rectangular spot about 5 inches wide by 2 inches tall an inch below vaccination site.  Arm is swollen and tender to touch, and it Itches severely,   This also happened after my first dose but I mistakenly thought I?d been bit by a spider after the vaccination.  The first time, it took about five days to stop itching, and for the swelling to go down.

                                                About a week after my vaccine I began feeling some swelling at the intersection of my left armpit. Next day was some more so but didn&#39;t hurt, just swollen feeling. I figured it was from the shot since I&#39;d recently had a mammogram and it was clear. A few days later I figured I should put it on my vsafe checking, but apparently it had expired. Today I  read an article that said some women had felt a lump under their arm after getting the COVID-19 shot and gone to the doctor, gotten a mammogram, and swelling showed on the picture.  Final statement of the article said it is most likely a reaction of the lymph node (mine was same side as shot[left] except one day only on right side) to the injection. Not to be concerned unless it lasted over a month, then see your doctor. I thought it might be helpful for both of us if I reported this. I&#39;ll keep track and see Dr. Last if it lasts more than a month.

                                                Left side of neck has developed swelling along lymph nodes. Went to Primary care Doctor. Saw her Nurse Practitioner on 3/3/21. Her nurse practitioner ordered Ultrasound Carotid Doppler Bilateral tests.  Radiology said Covid 19 vaccine research is showing some patients getting side effects of swelling of lymph nodes. Asked which arm I received vaccine in (left) same side as neck swelling and when I received first dose (2/08/2021).

On day 5, my left arm began itching (to the point of awakening me from a night&#39;s sleep) and by day 7, a red swollen hot and itchy area about the size of an orange appeared and the skin was very dry and coarse to the touch.  The itching continued for days with the red area increasing in size to encompass about three-fourths of my upper arm.  While the area increased in size, the itching and swelling decreased and  by day 15, it was all gone,  (I took pictures of it on 2/21 and 2/25 to document.)

It went down after a couple of days, but there is still a diagonal striation across upper arm which is visible and almost black and blue.  On Monday, March 1, I noticed a little puffy circle  slightly smaller than a penny and slight puffiness in armpit.  Did not even feel or see until shaving underarms.  No changes since.  Going to doctor Monday to let her check.

                                                Delayed cutaneous reaction. (1) An area on the shin of my right leg, approximately 2&#34; wide x 4&#34; long, became swollen, hot, and itchy at about 10:00 p.m. on Sunday 3/14/21 - two days after the vaccine. It resolved during the night. (2) On Day 3 - today 3/15/21 - the lymph nodes in my right armpit, where I had lymph nodes removed during breast cancer surgery in 2019, became swollen and remain so. (3) Swallowing seems a little more difficult, although I can eat and drink with no problem. My throat feels swollen but is pain-free.

My muscles in neck, lower back and calves also hurt. At 5:30 am the worst pain in right arm left and I went to bed.  Slept until noon. Temp 101.8 took ibuprofen.  Injection site swollen, painful, face slightly puffy. Day 2 - Site still swollen &amp; painful.  Entire top of left arm swollen. Temp 101.4 took Tylenol.  Right arm not as painful, mostly gone, muscles still sore.  Constipated. Fatigued.  Slept off and on. Day 3 - Temp still 101 but did go down to 99.   Still sore and injection site is still hot to touch and swollen.  Fatigued. Day 4 - Fever broke at 6 am.  98.8.  Injection site still very sore.  Finally was able to go to the bathroom.  Fatigued. Day 5 - Day 8  Injection site still sore and arm just feels funny.  Fatigued and low energy. Day 9 arm feels pretty good today and Day 10 arm is feeling ok.  I am still fatigued and feel like I need to sleep and rest a lot.  I used Tylenol and Ibuprofen.  I noticed just after getting my injection I seemed to have a lot more mucous than is normal.  That seems a bit better now.

It&#39;s been over a month since the vaccine and I still have some swelling in the area and arthritic like aching and pain.  Could the vaccine have aggravated an arthritic reaction?

Almost gone 3/16/21 (10 days).  - Very mild fever and fatigue on first day. Did not take temperature. -  Itchy skin hives and rashes on arms (more on vaccine arm), chest, back, waist, and thighs started about fifth or sixth day after vaccination.  Itchy hives and rashes are slowly abating as of today (5th day).  Am trying not to scratch them. Not taking medication for it.

It went up my neck on the left side, into the gland and into my ear.  I used Flonase once a day for 5 days beginning on 3/6/21.  I was dizzy off and on for about a week, like my equilibrium was affected.  I had this same event occur with the 2015 and 2016 Flu Vaccine.  When my ear &#34;acts up&#34; my doctor has had me use the Flonase once a day for 5 days, even though Steroids can cause Cushing&#39;s symptoms.  My ear is still &#34;stuffy&#34; and the gland in my neck &#34;feels funny&#34;.  Hearing does not seem to be impaired.

                                                I received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine , Lot 016M20A, as 1st injection on 2/12/21.  On 3/12/21 I received 2nd shot of Moderna, Lot 029A21A.   After 1st shot I had slight tenderness at injection site and a headache for 3 days.  After 2nd shot, by evening I developed a red, swollen and itchy spot about the size of a fifty cent piece. The spot grew slightly in size but was receding and almost gone by 3/16/21.  Then today, the rash has intensified to become red, swollen, itchy and tender again.  I am also experiencing the headache again.   Just wanted to report on my Covid/Moderna arm.

                                                Reaction after my 2nd shot on 3/9- I woke up on 3/10 with a swollen right , Big Toe- the swelling worsened day by day, and was painful to walk- on 3/15/2021, I went to Urgent Care- They took an xray, and sent me to a podiatrist, who tried to extract fluid to check for gout crystals- the foot was too swollen, and they were unable to extract fluid. It was then decided that I receive a shot of steroids. I was given that shot in office, and prescribed a medication for gout- Indomethacn- 50MG-  3X&#39;s a day.

                                                Terrible itching - like I was bitten by a 100 mosquitos. It felt hot to feel it; very red and very itchy. It was very swollen. Made my arm felt tight but not unbearable. It took a week to go away - it was the same every day. I tried to use Hydrocortisone cream  - a fresh tube of it - it did help alleviate the itching - some of it for awhile but the itch would fire back up again. After a shower, it got really red. It was resolved before the other vaccine.

                                                on Mar. 22, my arm was sore, I took a look and there was a bump and around it was red.  The swelling has gone, but it is still red and still al bit sore.  I put Isopropyl alcohol on a cotton pad and dabbed it on immediately.  Not sure if that is why the swelling went down, and I can actually see where the prick of the needle was.  I could not see that before.  The person who gave me my shot did not place a bandaid on as she said it wasn&#39;t bleeding so I didn&#39;t need one.  My husband also received a shot and he is fine.  So, I guess the bottom line is. is what &#39;s happening  to me common ?  And why 8 days later did this occur.

                                                My arm began itching at the injection site. I had a chemotherapy treatment two days later and was given Benadryl as part of my usual dose of medicines, therefore the itching stopped. However, by Wednesday night, 10 days after getting the vaccine, my arm swelled a little, was very red, and hot to the touch.  I called my doctor who told me I could take Tylenol if I needed to, but that this should go away in 24-48 hours.

                                                Started having diarrhea within a few days after the first shot.  Saw my Dr. and discussed issue with her.  Dr.  recommended that I take probiotics.  Started immediately after my appointment.  Have since changed my diet dramatically.  Still continue to have diarrhea--maybe a 2 day inbetween issues.  Also, after the 2nd dose of Moderna was sick for 24 hours, left arm swelled about 5 inches long with red spots.  That has now subsided.  Diarrhea continues.  Have ordered a new probiotic from MD.

                                                11 days after the shot, I developed a red itchy  rash with swelling.   I woke up that morning with a sinus headache, had diarrhea, then at night the rash started.  The next day, I was sick with headache, exhausted,  no appetite.  Today is day three - the rash is bigger, but I am not as sick as I was yesterday, though still tired, and no appetite, and a little nauseous.

                                                First symptom was  tightening of throat on 2/18/2021 not closing nor sore just tightening.  That lasted 48 hours.  Joint pain started after throat dissipated on Friday 2/19/21.  Joint pain was progressive from shoulders for several days, then  knees for a day, then tops of one foot for one night, then it moved to my hands.  I had swelling where I could not close my hands. I had severe and exstremely painful joint pain in  both hands that kept me up at night and unable to pick up things or close my hands.  I used ice packs for some relief. It would sometimes calm down somewhat for hours and I would think it was over and then it would come back . The hand symptoms lasted from 2/23/21  through 3/5/21 when pain began to slowly calm down.  I had one hand that would not close into a fist for one day 3/6/21 when pain was much less. By Sunday 3/7/21 most symtoms were much less with symptoms dissipating all together.  I have had no recurrence since the weekend of 3/6/21 of any symptoms.

Swelling and pain began to go down a little after one week.  Four weeks after vaccine nodes are still visibly larger than before the vaccine but nearly back to the size before and no longer painful.

Each day after the initial discovery,  the rash grew larger and the pain and heat grew in  intensity.  I iced my arm and took 3 Advil.  As of today the swelling has subsided.  The redness now  is across the entire front of my arm but the pain no longer prevails.

                                                Fever of 102 followed by facial swelling that looked like she&#39;d been in a fight almost it was so swollen her eyes could barely open. Then her face looked like it was covered in burns and started to scab over. We photographed her over the next 3-days and the burn like marks on her face started to scab over and swelling went down. The doctor believed from looking at the photos that it may have been shingles. Also had major fatigue.

                                                I had an adverse reaction approximately 35 minutes after my injection when I was  driving home. I had numbness on the left side of my mouth and lips which came on very quickly. This numbness was identical to the feeling of Novocain injected for dental work, except it came on much faster. My cheek and left side of the throat were swollen. I was also chilled.  The intense numbness lasted about 20 minutes. The swelling did not worsen.     12 hours later I had some numbness and swelling in the bottom left lip.  The cheek and throat swelling were gone.  24 hours following the injection I had swelling in the left side of the bottom lip and numbness in the corner of the left lip only.  36 hours later all symptoms were gone.

I was told to take 2 Benadryl at 6pm which I did.  Tingling stopped with Benadryl.  Not feeling right for next 5 days with shortness of breath, chest pains and blood pressure fluctations from high to low. Went back on 1/28/2021  PA did EKG and suggested that I see my cardiologist.

It is now exactly 2 weeks since the vaccine and it?s not better . I was given the vaccine in my left arm because the pharmacist told me it was protocol from the CDC.  I had 11 lymph nodes removed in that arm in 1995  and wanted the right arm.  He did say that if I insisted, he would redo the paperwork, so I reluctantly accepted. The left. I went to see my physician today and he told me not to take the second dose.

                                                It was a few days after the intial side effects an in the middle of the night my arm was hurting throbbing, and there was a lump. The next morning it was red and hot and very itchy. Used cortisone cream for the itching. I took two tylenol. It seems better today, but it is still itchy and hot to the touch.

                                                At first, my left arm was incredibly sore.  Then it became swollen, very red and hot.  This area expanded to almost below my elbow for five days, then, I had diarrhea for seven days.  It was extreme in that it was like having a colonoscopy prep every day.  I am not prone to diarrhea, normally.  This continued, even after multiple Immodium tablets each day.  My feces was bright yellow, loose and had I a lot of gas.  It is February 9th and I am still having some intestinal distress, but, it is not as bad.  I have not been eating much, as everything I eat seems to bring it on.  I have not sought treatment, as I don&#39;t have any money to do that.  I sort of self-treated.    I did not have a fever at any time.

                                                I work at  medical center where patient is being treated for a new diagnosis of Acute monocytic leukemia.  I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

                                                4 days after the vaccine, I had EXCRUCIATING nerve pain, starting at the upper vertabrae and  shooting down both arms to fingertips. Sometimes all the way down my back and the back of my legs.  I vomited all day, had a low fever which  lasted for 24 hours, then the pain and fever subsided. Still have nausea but no more vomiting .  I went to a doctor  after that, he also thinks it was a reaction..  On the 7th day, a purple splotchy rash showed on my skin and my hands started swelling up at night, so painful I couldn&#39;t even pull up the sheet.  The hand swelling goes down during the day and comes back at night.  I plan to get an antibody test  on  Feb. 26.  I am 98% certain that I had COVID in July, it was precisely the same symptoms and I had with the vaccine.  No treatment, just resting tilll it&#39;s over.  I am almost 80% better now, but not completely. I worry that I will never get back to 100%, it&#39;s been  11 days now.

I iced it on and off for about 3-4 days. Redness faded, but skin looked a bit discolored til it returned to normal. Upper arm was a bit swollen until it resolved.

                                                I had my 2nd dose of Moderna Vaccine on 3/4/2021 @ 8:40 AM. By 2 PM I experienced extreme fatigue for the remainder of the day. Unable to perform simple tasks like preparing dinner. On 3/5/21, I woke with a fever of 100.4 F, and general flu like symptoms: Killer headache, body aches, cold chills. My fever didn&#39;t rise above 100.6 F and the headache was untouchable with Tylenol or Advil. On 3/6/2021, My fever was gone but my left arm at the injection site was very red swollen and very warm to the touch. Just when I thought everything was OK, Yesterday 3/7/2021, I had a bout of diarrhea from about 10 AM until 3 PM only to be followed by swollen glands of my neck on the left side, it was so painful to turn my head, swallow and speak. There was no fever. Today, 3/8/2021, I can speak, and turn my head without discomfort, swelling is down, but when I swallow I still have some mild pain. My reason for telling you all if this is that I believe the symptoms of diarrhea and swollen neck glands ( only on the left side, injection side) are not listed anywhere that I could find. Has any one else reported similar symptoms? Thank you for your time and all you do!

They gave me prescriptions. I filled the Prednisone and took one pill a day for 7 days. Also ordered Acyclovir but I didn&#39;t  finish it because too many  side effects hitting me from pills. I am out of Prednisone and my face is still swollen. Bell&#39;s Palsey still here and active- 10 days later.

She is now having incontinence issues after the vaccine as well, is on medication that was working just fine prior. Pt now has swelling, redness, and blood vessel flare ups in her left ankle that hasn&#39;t occurred in a long time. Feels like the vaccine has exasperated some of her medical conditions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 71 year-old T2 diabetic female who presented to the ED late yesterday for evaluation of increasing shortness of breath. Also, reports she&#39;s had a nonproductive cough for several days. Yesterday, her breathing just sufficiently severe that she could not walk through the house without stopping to catch her breath. No chest pain. She ultimately decided to summon EMS. They reported that her initial SaO2 values to be in the low to mid 80% range. She was placed on 2 L/min of supplemental oxygen and given a SABA updraft in route.  When she arrived at the ED, her SaO2 registered 92%. She denies any prior history of asthma or COPD.  No ischemic or valvular heart disease. No history of CHF. No orthopnea. No pedal edema. No high fever. Of note, she completed her second COVID19 vaccination approximately 10 days prior to onset of her chief symptoms as described. In the ED, her chest x-ray was felt to show no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Her d-dimer was normal. However, a CTA of the chest revealed extensive centrilobular ground-glass nodularity throughout the lungs. No pulmonary embolus or signs of right heart strain. Patient admitted with atypical pneumonia/pneumonitis and associated dyspnea, cough and hypoxemia.  ASSESSMENT: 71-year-old T2 diabetic with hypertension presents with increasing shortness of breath and nonproductive cough, onset approximately 10 days post second COVID-19 vaccination.

I arm began to hurt and was very sore for about 3 hrs.  The the pain started to go away and I was fine.  On Sunday 3/14; the area around the shot started to itch constantly and continued along with a red rash type area a little bigger than a tennis ball.  The area of the shot and red rash type area became swollen.  Today, 3/16; the itching has almost completely stopped but the area is still swollen and red.  I did read the side effectives and they normally develop within 1 - 3 days.  My side effects didn&#39;t really start until 10 days after the shot.  I also experienced a few chills.  I did not ready about the side effects of the shot until after I experienced them.  I&#39;m scheduled to have my second shot on 4/2 and I&#39;m concerned about the side effect I&#39;m having now and if I should have the 2nd shot and/or what to expect for side effects.,

My symptoms started roughly 9 hours after the shot; I slept (or tried to) that night and most of the next day. Around 36 hours later, most of the symptoms had passed. At this point (48 hours later), there&#39;s still some fatigue, the arm is still swollen, and it has now begun to itch. (It might have done so earlier.)

I took Tylenol late in the afternoon of 3/15/ 21 and that helped with the fever and discomfort. These symptoms subsided in the morning of Mar. 16th.  As of March 17 I only have some residual tenderness in my left arm.

                                                On the 9th day after vaccination my arm began itching. The next morning (10th day) I noticed a red rash beneath the injection site, and the rash area was hot to the touch and swollen. I&#39;m at day 14, the rash isn&#39;t as bright red but it&#39;s larger (larger than my palm), still swollen, and still hot to the touch. I&#39;m reporting this because the CDC website says only 14 people have reported having this.

By the afternoon it had spread across the upper area of my arm.  Very red, hot and swollen.  Over the next several days It has continued to spread across my entire upper arm.  As of today, it has even started to swell and be hot and red underneath my upper arm.

I had the 2nd. vaccination on 3/10/21 and had no further symptoms, but there is still slight swelling and the knot remains in my lymph node.

                                                The day after vaccination I had a swollen face and I had Asthma issues for about 4 days. I had taken a Benadryl before I went to bed but I still woke up with swollen face which is what happens with some of my drug allergies. The swelling in my face lasted four days during which I took Benadryl every six hours. Four days after the shot I had issues with Herpes. I have never had this before. I had a burning sensation in my genitals and went to visit my doctor the next day. The doctor ran multiple tests and prescribed Valacyclovir 1 gm tablets for 10 days. The symptoms did not resolve until the full course of the medication before I got relief. The results came back Herpes Simplex 1 but I was negative for the antibodies for Herpes Simplex1. I have received the second dose with the normal side effects for two days, joint pain body aches. I was bedridden for two days. My face swelled up again  and lasted a little longer than four days. The swelling was more profound but I had taken Benadryl before I started. My Asthma was a little worse after both vaccines. I had to use it more often for four or five days after vaccination.

Her head started itching as well, and every time she took a shower her hair would fall out and her hair is very thin now due to the hair loss.  Every time she combs her hair she gets wads of hair on the comb.  She went to her doctor and told him what was going on and gave her a steroid shot to calm it down.  The arm soreness eased up after 5 days, but her head still itches some and she still has the hair loss.  She can&#39;t even cover her ears with her hair anymore, and on top it&#39;s really thin as well.

No fever, no other side effects....just a growing red rash.

                                                3 hours after receiving injection, I had severe diarrhea.  Into the night I began vomiting (which lasted all night)  I became feverish, had chills with body shaking, extreme nausea. (temp 102) This persisted to the next day and I went to the ER.  There I was given  multiple liters of IV fluids,  IV Zofran and IV Tylenol.   I felt better after treatment but still had the intense headache and ringing in the ears.  The next day, I&#39;m now gradually beginning to feel better, just weak.  I can eat today, two days after the injection and slowly beginning to feel better.   This reaction was terrible for me.

In a matter of 3 hours I went to the ER because the swelling, pain and itching was  severe. Pain radiated to my shoulder and below my scaplua.  ER thought I may have a cellulitis stated on Keflex.

I continue to have pain in my arm, shoulder and back and some itching .  the rash area is discolored brownish and very dry.

Soreness went away and injection site could not be found. 5 days after the shot was administered,, my arm started getting sore and I felt achy.  The 6th day, symptoms got worse, achy and chills, but no fever that I am aware of.  7th day, symptoms persisted but not as bad, except that my arm had swollen up and turned red all the way to my elbow and felt  like a large hard knot.  Today, I am not as achy or chilled, but my arm is still hot, red, and swollen .  The redness is below the injection site, although the injections site looks like a little red pimple, whereas earlier, I couldn&#39;t even find it.

                                                Initially, the only side effect was soreness at the site of injection.  5 days later, I started feeling tired and achy.  I developed chills and had muscle aches like the flu.  No fever.  The next day, my arm started getting sore below the injection site and itched.  That night, my whole arm was swollen, red,  sore, hot to touch and itched.  The redness extended around my upper arm and down to the elbow.  It had been 8 days since the vaccination and I still have the red itchy arm.

Then 7 days after the vaccine, she experienced severe pruritis that actually woke her from sleep and had been scratching the area. It has now on day 8 become much more indurated and has grown in size, even during today.

Took Tylenol, reduced it to 99.4; temp went back up later in afternoon to 100.4, more Tylenol reduced fever to 99.2.  Slept a lot that day.  On Sunday, woke up with monster headache, started throwing up at noon.  Contacted doctor ... took Zofron.  Sell more.  Threw up again at 4 pm.  And by midnight could not tolerate water ... throwing it up too.  Monday continued throwing up.  But started feeling better that evening and tolerated jello.  Cautious today but on the mend. My arm was a brilliant red, very tender, swollen, and developed a hard knot.  Finally swelling going down today.

                                                Skin rash, swelling, warm to the touch. Monday morning when I lifted my arm it hurt- felt like it was bruised. Dr. administered a Benadryl injection in left buttocks. She drew the outline of the area. The next day the rash had spread outside the lines. Took 2 Benadryl over the counter tablets and today it has spread more.

                                                My left arm became red, swollen, itchy and hot to the touch eight days after receiving the Moderna vaccine.  The red area was approximately 8&#34; long by 4&#34; wide and was on my upper arm around the location of the injection site.  I treated it with lynocaine and aloe to relieve the itching.  After 2 days the swelling started to go down but the redness looked more like a rash.  It took about 6 days for it to completely go away.  I did not seek medical attention during the event and I have had no further problems.

                                                First vaccine digestive symptoms and minor aches; very sore left arm lasted 7 days; 2nd vaccine: 102 degree fever on next day; aches and pains all over; could barely get out of bed; inability to eat at all for 24 hours; digestive symptoms: gas, acid refulx, nausea; giant burps. By next day, very painful electric transitory pains (seconds) in core of my vascular formation in my upper left leg. This is a congenital defect that responds to estrogen, but also some medicines like synthroid, which I do not take after getting reaction with just 3 pills. Successfully moderated Hashimoto&#39;s with strict gluten-free and dairy-free diet. I have never experience such severe leg pain and massive swelling, still happening today. Th The only other time that I have experienced these short intermitent &#34;electric&#34; pains was during infertility treatment at age 40, more than 30 years ago. I suspect something in the adjuvant. I hope that this will exit my body because the sudden swelling and severe pain is not something I can endure. It barely beats dying from Covid-19. My quality of life is wrecked for the time being. I suspect that this vaccine has caused an autoimmune attack on my vascular malformation; that my T cells have gone beserk. I&#39;d be willing to have my antibodies against Covid checked and I&#39;ll bet I have more than average! The havoc for people with autoimmunity and Moderna vaccine is serious. I despair and hope that it won&#39;t have a lasting impact on my health. I will volunteer to be studied, but no more Moderna vaccine for me!

On Feb 21st started having severe pain in both legs from the knees down to the ankles. No swelling, but ice and ibuprofen lessened the pain some. Still also have tenderness in right arm from when shot was administered. Wondering if the pain my legs is related to the shot. Have also had small headache since having shot everyday.

Strong headache  ,  shoulder / neck pain ,  and strong fatigue .    All symptoms noted here continued for approximately 6 to 7 days. The 3 rd day of symptoms   I went to my Family Doctor who advised me to NOT take Dose # 2 of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine due to possibility of having a worse reaction , possible anaphylaxis  reaction .  I notified Health Dept. that same day  and cancelled my scheduled 2 nd dose vaccine  appointment.

                                                On Friday (02/12) my upper arm, just below the injection site became red and itchy.  With pressure I could feel some lumps nearby.  The next morning (2/13) the area of redness and itchiness had expanded in all directions and and was also swollen and felt hot to the touch. By afternoon it had expanded to about an inch or more above the injection site, and was also expanding downward and around the sides of my arm. By bedtime, it was about the size of my hand.  Still red, swollen, hot to the touch, itching, and still had some deep lumps that were only noticable when rubbing deep.  Over time, I realized that where I could feel the lumps was the direction of the spread.   On 02/14 it was still spreading and the itching was worse.  (Don&#39;t gasp, or laugh, but spit did more to relief the itching more than water)   Feb. 15 it started getting better, and by 02/17  it was almost gone, except for the blotchy redness.

It lasted two or three days then went away.  However, on 2-23-21 another red area appeared in the same place with a lump underneath and it felt hot.  It is still that way today 2-25-21 and seems to be spreading a little.    No itching either time.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I got my 1st. Moderna vaccine 1/24/21. Side effect was only a slightly sore arm for 2 days.  However, 8 hours after my 2nd shot on 2/20/21 I felt nauseas, had chills, 103 fever, very pink arm from top of shoulder down almost to elbow.  Very sore arm. I took Tylenol 10 hours after 2nd. shot. fever went down to 100.  And back up to 103 with chills for the next 24 hours. The next morning I had a lump in my armpit lymph node for size of a small plum. I went to my GP at 10 a.m. and my BP was 90/52.  Normally, BP is about 112/68.

                                                Not feeling well for the first week and pain in shoulder and arm. On 2/20 I noticed tenderness in arm pit. On 2/24 I noticed a lump in my arm pit along with increased tenderness.  The lump was large enough that I could feel it with my arm down. On 2/24 I made an appointment with my health care provider.  I was given an antibiotic ( Clindamycin 300 mg) to take for 10 days for pain and swelling . On 3/3  I notice the symptoms had not improved and tenderness had progressed down my arm to the elbow area and also into the back of my shoulder from the arm pit area.

                                                pt stated that starting about 1:30 after getting the vax she had nausea and severe pain in the right arm which kept increasing in pain until she was unable to move her arm.  That night her arm was in the 9-10 range for pain.  She hasn&#39;t been able to sleep due to the pain.  The next day she took Tylenol but did not help with pain. She had a strange taste in her mouth and also loss of appetite.  On 3/6/2021  she started getting a back ache.  She tried taking Ibuprofen which helped some with swelling in her arm but not the pain.  On 3/7/2021 she started getting a headache, brain fog and saying her words backwards.  She is very upset with the lack of warning that she was given at the time of the getting the first dose of the vax about being in this type of pain afterwards.  She said she was not prepared for this.  She has to have help doing everything and lives alone. Today the arm pain seems to slightly be improving but her back is still hurting.  Pt contacted her PCP.  They only instructed her to take Tylenol and not to ice it.  She contacted the Public Health Dept they told her to take Ibuprofen and to ice it.  She is getting conflicting information and doesn&#39;t know how to treat it.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  No other vaccines given same time. Within 15- 20 minutes of receiving injection, the back of my tongue &amp; back of throat were burning &amp; tingling. Within 30 minutes more of my throat was tight, more of my face was tingling &amp; swelling.  Home by 45-50 minutes after injection. By then my whole face, neck, throat, was tight &amp; swollen. I was having trouble swallowing &amp; red raised itchy rash all over my body. I Took 100 mgm benedryl by mouth as soon as I got home.  I also had my epipen available. Within an hour of taking benedryl it began to reverse the effects. I took another 100 mgm of benedryl 4 hrs later. At bedtime I felt wiped out but better. Throat very faw for. Couple of days.

Began to have swallowing difficulty. I was getting a woozie feeling within 30 minutes. I took 100mgm benedryl by mouth w about a pint of water. For the next 50-60  minutes, the tightness continued as far as below my collar bones  face very tight swollen. Red raised itchy rash started all over my body.  Had epipen in hand as well as stat dose of prednisone to take if necessary.  (I have an allergic reaction protocol in hand from my doc for these cases. Transport to ER is always there if needed) . Took about an hour for the benedryl to start countering the adverse affect.  Took another 100 mgm at the 4 hr post injection time mark.  By bedtime about 10pm, I felt very fatigued, throat &amp; back of tongue very sore &amp; raw feeling.

                                                Three days after my second Moderna jab on Sunday, March 7, 2021, I developed fever blisters across my lower lip. I rarely get fever blisters. I had received my second jab the morning of March 7, and 11 hours later I had a fever (3 degrees), chills, and fatigue. The next morning I still had some fever but felt okay and took it easy that day and the next day, i.e., Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday morning I started getting the fever blister symptoms and they became full-blown over the following days.

                                                Four hours after receiving the first dose I experienced  substantial swelling , redness, heat, and a very heavy upper left arm. I was unable to sleep on that side for a week. The redness , swelling and heat lasted 14 days. My doctor looked at my arm on day 11 , and was surprised seeing the bright redness and feeling the heat 11 days after vaccination. The full healing  finally occurred on day 15. Hence  I opted not to get the second dose since the reaction might be far greater.

This disappeared on 3-03-2021.  On 2-22- two instances of what felt like an extreme charley horse over both pectoral muscles.  One was mid morning and the other early afternoon.  Duration was 10-15 seconds.      3-20-2021 Moderna dose #2 given.  On 3-21 arm was sore and swollen.  Noises in head began.  These were like grains of sand being shaken in a paper bag.  The noise was continuous and did not change with activity or position.  The noise came in two&#39;s and three&#39;s.  Noises went away the next day.  On 3-22-2021 arm was almost back to normal but a flat red rash appeared from neck to belly button.  By evening the rash was very red and itchy.  Sometimes it felt like a bad sunburn.   On 3-23-2021 the rash began to fade and by evening it was gone.

It took longer for the heart to suction up the blood before each heartbeat and I could feel a beat or a thud after each succioning up of the blood. The sequence felt like: slow suctioning, then a pounding; slow succioning followed by a pounding, etc. I also felt a frequent fluttering of the heart.   The rash on the arm has turned to redness. The swelling and hardness are still there. The feet are still red and swollen and I can feel the enlarged, hard lymph glands. I&#39;m still lethargic and sleep throughout the day. The heart problems only began to subside this afternoon.  Because of the above symptoms (and other symptoms I cannot directly connect to the injection, but that occurred at the same time), I am afraid to get the second injection.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

I could feet the sides of my chests getting tight - felt like pressures were building up with swelling.  I did not have problems with breathing.  About 10 minutes later I could feel my lips swelling, but stopped after about 10 minutes.  In the evening, felt nausea.  Did not feel well for two days.  Got a little better on the third day but not completely well.  Completely recovered on the fourth day.  Should I get the second shot?  I am afraid it might be worse on the second shot if what I was feeling were due to allergy.

                                                Awoke at 1:34 AM and my left foot hurt.  I had a marble-size lump and a few small lumps on the vertical bone above my heel that were tender to the touch.  My foot on top was slightly swollen and shiny and red on the side and both were tender to the touch.  I massaged my foot and went back to sleep.  When I awoke the marble-sized lump was much smaller.  I got up, ate, and in the afternoon after research, I realized it was gout and I had tophi for the first time ever.  I had my first gout flare in November 2003 without tophi, and never had another flare until 2/14/2021!  I walked and suddenly my Achilles? tendon hurt and my heel hurt a little.   I took 2 Colchicine and took one more an hour later.  It seemed much better and didn?t hurt but some of the pain returned.  I couldn?t sleep until 4:05 AM and awoke around 6 according to my Fitbit watch.  I contacted my doctor and he said to take one Colchicine every day until the pain is gone.

                                                On Sat morning upon arising and taking a shower I noticed a red line almost welt on my arm by afternoon there were 2 lines and they were getting longer and wider. By Monday morning the area covered with puffiness and redness was about  at least 4 inches wide and going  almost entirely around the arm. It hurt and was very warm to touch along with starting to itch. It was not hard at the\at time. Placed a call to my doctor and was advised to see him or urgent care. I choose the later to do. In checking it out they mentioned that they have been seeing the quite often in the last couple weeks. Take an aspirin, tylenol or ibuprophn  and put cold conpresses on for 20 minutes as often as I can. This morning (Tuesday 23rd of February) it has enlarged again some redness is gone but it apprears to be black and blue now. Still itching, I have not itched it as of yet.

                                                I am not 100% certain of this event being related to the vaccination with the Moderna COVID19 shot or not.  However, in the interest of completeness and for investigative purposes, I am reporting to you the event in relation to the vaccination as the patient reported to me.  She received the vaccination on 2/14/2021 and became very confused.  She had significant left arm swelling much worse than when she had her first vaccination.  Her husband brought her to the emergency room and she was eventually discharged, but she went on to develop significant hypertension and she reported that her blood pressures were normal prior to the vaccination.  She had an emergency room visit in which her systolic pressures were well above 240.  She revisited the emergency room and had elevated blood pressures of 240 and was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy and later found to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES.  We have started the patient on medications, and started laboratory work-up for secondary hypertension and her blood pressures have improved with treatment.  We discussed the case with the neurologist, who suggested that we repeat MRI scan to make sure that her punctate lesions noted on MRI on this admission on 2/25/2021, have resolved.  It was advised that if they had not resolved that we should call neurology again.  Hypertensive encephalopathy is rare and press syndrome as a result is also rare.  It is for this reason that I am reporting this event as again, I am not trying to mislead anyone or distort information, but should this be an adverse effect of the vaccine I wanted to make sure that this was reported as the patient&#39;s history prior to the vaccination and developing this complication post vaccination are temporally related at a minimum.  The patient is a known smoker but quit on the 14th of this month.

                                                At 12:30 a.m. on March 3rd I began having severe shivering for about 3 1/2 hours. This caused my blood pressure to go up to 175/99, pulse 128. I also began running a fever at about that time and ran it for about 24 hours, highest is got was 101 . Arm is swollen. I had covid the first week of October so am not sure if this played into my reaction. I am concerned about taking my second shot if this is what I experienced with my first one.

I was having difficulty breathing. It was like I had been stung by a bee. I took couple of benadryl and used nebulizer. Also had mild headache. I have notified my PA of this reaction. Used Ventolin throughout day and took tylenol.

She attributes this to her vaccine. Immediately after receiving the vaccine she felt completely fine without any side effects. One night ago she began to feel like she was getting an ear infection with some pain and pressure to her right ear. Today, she noticed some swelling to the right side of her neck. She also feels dehydrated as she has not been eating or drinking much. Additionally, she endorses some agitation last night.

                                                Received 1st dose shot on 01:30 PM 02/17/2021.  Arm started swelling and red blotches appeared on upper arm 1st night.  Went online to Moderna website to determine if this was normal.  Said had red blotches, call doctor.  Called on 02/18/2021.  Advised to use ice pack and Benadryl if had it.  Only had Benadryl cream.  Ice pack too painful, used ice water and wash cloth wrap.  Blotches started fading on 3rd day.  Still had swelling, pain at vaccine site diminished.  On 5th day blotches gone, itching began.  Benadryl cream helped with itching for 2 days.  Day 7 and 8 Benadryl cream stopped working, redness on upper arm became really noticeable and swelling increased.  Day 9, swelling continued &amp; became hard, redness across upper arm above and below shot site, arm hot.  By evening decided to call doctor the next morning.  Day 10, Dr. office visit.  Dr. was not sure why this was happening, said it could have been something picked up on needle before shot given as there was internal infection and skin infection. He prescribed antibiotics and gave me an antibiotic shot.  Started meds as directed.  Day 11 skin redness became a raised welt and started crawling down my arm.  Arm swelling made skin tight and arm was still hot.  Day 12 welt almost to my elbow.  No pain only sensitive to touch and itching continued.  Day 13 doctor?s office visit again because of increased symptoms.  Doctor started looking at other causes, gave me an additional stronger oral antibiotic and another more potent antibiotic shot.  Day 14 another doctor?s office visit to see if there was any improvement.  Skin welt crawl had stopped to elbow, but there was still some on upper arm but smaller, swelling and hot had diminished.  Days 15-16, swelling diminished more, welt crawl stopped and redness decreased.  Day 17, last doctor?s office visit.  Little red around the edges only.  Arm discolored where welt had been.  Doctor had by then determined that my immune system had gone into overdrive on the COVID vaccine received.  He advised me not to get the second dose shot or I could have an even more intense reaction.  Days 18-22.  Welt gone, still discoloration but much lighter.  Finished antibiotics. Still have some itching (intermittent). (THIS IS THE 3RD ATTEMPT OVER THE LAST 2 WEEKS TO ENTER THIS INFO).  As of 03/17/2021 still experiencing some affects.

My arm was very swollen, fatigue and bad headache with loud ringing in the head. My blood pressure accelerated  to nearly 200/88 and had to be admitted to the ER three days after shot. I was in the hospital for two days and had a series of CAT scans and ultrasounds.  Loud ringing in my head has not stopped. Never had a history of high blood pressure, but now they put me on high blood pressure medication along with the baby aspirin. I was a relatively healthy woman until I had these vaccinations.

                                                First Moderna dose 2/16/21 - expected reactions: achiness, headache, slight fever; symptoms gone after about 48 hours.  Five days later, swollen/painful left jaw and earache in left ear.  Did not respond to Tylenol.  Doctor prescribed Doxycycline for possible ear infection. Problem with antibiotic after only one day, so discontinued. Pain/swelling in jaw slowly subsided.  Earache lessened, but still would come and go to lesser extent.  Second Moderna dose 3/16/21 - same expected reactions for about 48 hours.  Swollen jaw did not return, but earaches (now in both ears) come and go.  Some tinnitus in both ears, but on and off.  Neither earaches nor ringing in ears is constant, but of concern.  One month past second Moderna dose and the ear involvement persists.

Six days later I became aware of warmth on my are and a defused rash. Today, 13 days later, the rash is totally red with defined edges and larger in area than last week. It is not totally painful, but I feel it, am aware of it on my arm. It itches slightly and feels good to be gently rubbed.

Now, 4 days later there is still a bit of tenderness. I am expecting there to be less or none tomorrow.   I don&#39;t think this is a serious result but still it is a reaction but possibly others have encountered.

Started feeling sick during the night, knew something was wrong.  Could barely get out of bed, was hot, possibly low grade fever, had chills, was achy, bad headache like you feel when having the flu, weakness.   Took Tylenol and her regular medicines.  Today, 1/29/21 when she woke up still has extreme soreness, hot to touch.  She looked at her left arm and it&#39;s all swollen, red and itchy.  She&#39;s now afraid to go back for the 2nd vaccine.   Caller her pharmacy due to her arm and she was instructed to take Benadryl and Ibuprofen, which she only takes Tylenol.

                                                On Jan 26th when I woke up in the morning I saw that a large portion of my upper left arm was very bright red and over the subsequent 3 days including today the area of redness expanded, got larger. So now the red rash is covering almost my entire upper left arm down to the elbow. And day of onset I had a low grade fever but temp was normal after that. In the center of the rash, there is a darker area that was slightly swollen and the whole area, but especially the darker, area is warm to the touch. I did see the Dr. on Wednesday January 27th and he prescribed Keflex antibiotic which I am still taking.

                                                Patient received a Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at our store for her first dose. She said her left arm where she received the vaccine was a little tender. 2-3 days after the injection, she said her arm became swollen, red, hot, slightly itchy but no pain and decided to seek medical treatment. On Jan 27, 2021 she had a Zoom telemedicine appointment where the prescriber assessed that she had cellulitis and prescribed a 10-day course of cephalexin. She said she has had cellulitis from a vaccine before 20 years ago when she received either her flu or pneumococcal vaccine. As of 2/6/2021, she said the redness is 95% resolved with only faint redness. She said the vaccine administrator swabbed her arm with alcohol but then injected the vaccine outside of the range that she cleaned.

She did not think much about it and thought she may have slept on her arm funny.  She had not reported anything to us prior to 2/10/2021 at which time her husband came in asking about side effects and if we had heard of any affecting the elbow and now the hand.  I advised him to have her call me.  I subsequently spoke to her today and she said her hand is now swollen and hurts on the left arm.

                                                Five days after injection the site became red and itchy, a rash broke out on the arm and them spread to back, arms, hands, legs, on Day 6 woke with swelling of lips and face.  Went to urgent care on advice of personal dr.  Prescribed Hydrozine, Pepcid, Predinsone with caution to wait on Pred if possible.  Hydrozine seem to make things worse, liquid Benadryl offered some relief.  After two more days started Prednisone.  Swelling started to come down after a day on Pred.  Rash still prevelant but slightly less itchy.  Six days of pred did not kill rash.  Second round of Pred finally calmed the rash.   I believe this to be PEG allergy based on reviewing med history

                                                On 2/9/21 I woke up with a raised,  red, swollen rash on my left arm probably 2&#34; x 2&#34; in size.  I had a scratchy throat, mild headache and chills.  I went to Urgent Care (per my primary care&#39;s instructions).  Diagnosis was Cellulitis (skin infection caused by bacteria at the injection site) and put on 100mg Doxycycline twice a day for 7 days.  Over the next few days the rash increased in size and I still was getting chills and tingling sensations on my skin especially my face so I contacted my Primary Care and had a follow-up appointment with them on 2/11/21.  I was told to stop the Doxycycline because they did not think it was Cellulitis, but was a reaction to the Vaccine (Covid Arm).  On 2/15/21 I saw my Dermatologist because I am still having tingling sensations on my face and my Rosacea is acting up - they put me on a topical cream Ketoconazole.  The rash on my arm is just a little red at the outer edge, but slowly disappearing.

Her arm had a swelling on it, and was pretty sore where she received the shot.  Every ache or pain that she ever had was screaming at her and every time she tried to move she screamed in pain.  On her right back it felt like it was broken, so painful to move.  Her husband pulled her out of the bed to get up, help her make dinner.  It did not go away all day, just awful until she fell asleep at night.  She continued to take Tylenol throughout the day.  When she woke up this morning she was back to normal except for her arm that is still a little sore.

One day after receiving Dose 2 (right arm this time), observed approx four inch in diameter red ash area, approx two inches below injection site.  Upon touch, the area covered by rash is slightly swollen, warm, and firm.  Rash area is more diffuse that that noticed after Dose 1.  I also have slight tenderness and slight swelling in right armpit area, but no redness.  Beginning 2-24-21 have been applying icepacks several times a day for 15 minutes and slight improvement, but rash remains as described.

                                                Following the vaccine, within 3 minutes her bottom lip got numb, then her tongue swelled and then her eyes got fluttery uncontrollably, dizziness and weak.  They had her lie down in a recliner.  Her BP was 190/110.  She did not need an EPI pen and within 15 minutes her lip became unnumb, and her tongue swelling receded, was still a little thick, and her face was swollen, was red and flushed.  So they waited 30 minutes, her BP was not coming down, sent to the ER and observed for 3 hours and slowly her BP came down, all her other symptoms subsided and she was able to drive herself home.  Last night 2/25/21 she had great itching on her chest, which has since stopped.  Her tongue is still a little swollen, about 20% still feels thick.  When she left the hospital her BP was 146/86.  She has not taken anything for the symptoms just her regular routine medications.   She did feel tired and spacy feeling, and has been off of work since Wednesday as she could not focus to go to work.

                                                Arm where the vaccine was given became red, swollen, itchy, hot, and sore. I noticed it on March 1, 2021, 8 days after the vaccination.  The size of the red spot is 2.5 inches by 1.5 inches today (March 2, 2021).

She had stiffness of her neck, and then within the next day she ended up having the gland on her right side of her neck swell all the way up to her ear.  Then she developed little bumps which make her itch.  Then it went from her right chin, all the way to the right side of her neck.  Nothing on the left.   She was having so much pain and she had what she described as the mumps that she found on the internet, and all the symptoms associated with that description.    She still has itching, and bumps again from her shoulder to the right side of her neck.   She went to the pharmacist and tried to explain it to him, he told her to take some Benadryl.  Called the nurse who told her to take Ibuprofen and aspirin.  She did call her doctor and they told her that they would get back to her within 48 hours.

Then at night I couldn&#39;t put my legs down they hurt and my shins felt like I had shin splines.  This lasted about a week or more. I went to a Dr. because my left knee and shin were hurting so bad.  The Dr. was not sure and did a Doppler to see If I had a Blood clot in my left knee but I didn&#39;t. She put me on an antibiotic, that I really didn&#39;t need I don&#39;t think. I took that for  a few days and stopped because it wasn&#39;t helping any. On the 14th I went to see another Dr. and he put me on Prednisone, at this time I could barley walk my right hip was hurting so much. I was taking little bitty steps.  The prednisone has been helping, it&#39;s allowed me to walk and to function. I was to the point it was getting so bad. I&#39;m still having some stiffness, my left elbow gets inflamed at times, my left hand and knuckle swell and get stiff at times too. It seems to move around at effect different places.  The medication helps me move better, I have been off work for 7 weeks, I plan to go back and try half days.

                                                Lightheaded after vaccine.  Did not last long.  That is the only problem I had directly after the vaccine. Thirty-six hours later (Tuesday, 2/16/21) I had a rash on my left hand. My hand was very itchy, red and swollen.  I had a bump under the skin of my left  hand about the size of a dime.  I also felt some tingling from my waist down to my feet which went away after a few hours. The rash and the bump lasted 3 days.  Dr (primary) told me &#34;Do not get the second shot.&#34;

Went back into pharmacy and they called 911.  EMT took me to ambulance to check vitals and this took about 45 minutes.  They offered to take me to hospital but declined as had my husband suffering from cancer who also had shot and can&#39;t drive was waiting in the car.  We drove 1/2 mile to friends home and waited to make sure felt ok to drive back.  Drove home ok and have been feeling tired for 3 days but otherwise ok.  Pharmacy followed up next day.  Today feel a bit of pressure in the chest and have placed a call to my doctor but he has gone for weekend.  I will go to emergency room if I feel worse and will call him on Monday to report incident.

                                                My husband and I both had the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccination on February 6.  After the first dose, we both just had sore arms.  Today,  March 9, after having had the 2nd dose on March 6, both of us have swollen  and warm arms with a red rash.  We had both vaccinations in the same arm rather than changing arms.  I am just reporting this information so that it is in your files in relation to the number of people who report this reaction  Perhaps the second dose should be given in alternate arm.  I, not my husband, also experienced 101.7 fever with aches the next day. Husband had headache. Since this is such a new vaccine, I thought this information would be useful.

As days went on the swelling increased , along with pain, and redness.Difficulty walking . Ankles swollen, skin shiny, very painful.  Called Dr. he advised give it a few more days, not knowing why this was happening. My Rheumatologist suggested it was  an allergic reaction of some kind. She discontinued my Lamisil and Fosomax.  Redness continued along with swelling , and pain . On March 9, went to my physician. Saw the PA, she said she would speak to Dr. He wanted to make sure I didn?t have DVTs. He wanted me to get a Doppler for clots. I went to Hospital and had Doppler and it was Negative for deep vein thrombosis.

                                                22 hours after vaccination and one hour after taking morning pills, patient developed full body rash and itching.  Morning meds she consumed were: Losartan, amlodipine, pravastatin, escitalopram, baby aspirin, vitamin D3.  Episode of rash and itching improved with oral Benadryl 50 mg.  The next day patient took her meds same time and one hour later developed rash.  Took Benadryl and rash resolved.  Patient then stopped medications for 1 week and had no occurrences of rash.  Restarted medications morning of 3/10/21 and developed full body rash with itching and early anaphylaxis, one hour after medication consumed.  It should be noted, patient has been on these medications for several years without reaction.  Reaction started after she had received the Moderna COVID19 vaccination.  On 3/10/21 when she had full body rash with anaphylaxis, patient presented to our clinic and was given 2 rounds of IM epinephrine, IM Benadryl 50 mg, IM Solu-Medrol 125 mg, and oral Zyrtec.  Episode took 2.5 hours to resolve.  Patient prescribed tapering course of prednisone, Zyrtec once daily, famotidine 20 mg once daily for the next 7 days, outpatient.  We will be restarting one medication at a time to assess for medication reaction.

My usual temperature is 97.7.  I had severe neck ache and head ache extreme fatigue,  and was bed ridden for 4 days.  My fever started to decrease on the third day.   I had roving pains which lasted 3-4 hours in each place:  first the right back above the waist where the kidneys are, then just below my right breast, then the left side of the top of my head.  Throughout I had to have a wet cloth on my head.  About a week later I had a relapse.... my temperature rose to 98 and I had the same headache place and neck ache at the bottom back of my head along with extreme fatigue and brain fog.  It lasted at least two days.   Of course as expected my arm was sore, but very swollen like a goose egg,  red, and impossible to move.    I still feel the same fatigue, and have to go to be very early but have insomnia and extreme anxiety.

                                                Tuesday evening I started feeling itchy and creepy crawly under my skin. I had red spots and itchy and the more I itched it the itchier it got. I had hives under the bra line on my right side, hives on my right arm and on my stomach. My hands were getting swollen. I took Benadryl a few times. On Thursday I was starting to get chest pain so I went to the ER and I was getting more blotchy and my hands were more swollen. they kept me over night and I had a chest x-ray,  CT Scan, an EKG and a stress test. all these tests were negative. My hands were so swollen that you couldn&#39;t see my knuckles.I developed hives under the blood pressure cuff and under the iv arm wrap.

She has a history of DVT and had more swelling and redness in one leg leading to ultrasound to rule out a DVT and labs significant for an elevated D-dimer which then led to a CTA of her chest because of additional complaints of breathlessness.  The ultrasound and CTA were negative for any clots.  She was prescribed furosemide for the swelling.  D-dimer was 2.26 micrograms/mL.  Due to the temporal nature of events, I felt filing a report was necessary.

                                                Patient is a lovely 74-year-old female with a long history of PACs and hypertension.  Her blood pressure has been getting a little bit worse over the past years.  She was admitted through the ER with 1st known episode of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She reports that on 02/02 she received her 2nd COVID vaccine.  She had joint achiness and a low-grade temperature.  She rested the following day but then on 02/04 went for her usual hour long runs/hike.  She did not feel very well during exercise and started have a headache and some increasing palpitations.  Later that evening she was watching TV and started to have significant tachycardia that was irregular. Symptoms persisted and she presented to the ER which sound to be in AFib with rapid ventricular response with a blood pressure of 215/158. She was started on a diltiazem drip and has converted to sinus rhythm with PACs.  Blood pressure has improved significantly.  Troponin negative x2.   Her last evaluation at a Heart facility was  in 2017.  She had an echocardiogram in 2014 with normal EF, mild MR and mild TR with normal estimated PA systolic pressure.   She denies chest pain or dyspnea.  No history of syncope.  Sometimes with palpitation she does get lightheaded.  She gets occasional lower extremity edema that seems dependent in nature.  She is still having palpitations but recognizes that she is no longer in atrial fibrillation as that was more severe in terms of symptoms of tachycardia.

Hospital course: 74 y.o. female admitted on 4/8/2021 for abdominal pain. Notable PMHx: aortic valve replacement, HTN   On morning of admission, patient woke up with severe epigastric pain.  Describes pain as a pressure.  Has had vomiting.  Had bowel movement after pain started.  Patient came to the emergency room.  Patient received an antiemetic and Demerol.  Patient has continued to have pain in got a dose of morphine as well.  Pain eased some but was still 7/10.  In the ER, blood pressure was very elevated with systolic in 200s.  Cardiac enzymes negative.  EKG look good with normal sinus rhythm.  Patient has aortic valve replacement and is on Coumadin with INR goal of 2.5-3.5.  INR was elevated at 4.3.  D-dimer was negative.  Amylase and lipase negative.  Creatinine normal at 0.9.  Chest x-ray done which showed no acute disease.  On the floor, we ordered a CT abdomen.  It did show gallstones, but nonobstructing.  It showed kidney stones in the renal pelvis, but none obstructing.  No other inflammation or signs of bleeding.  Blood pressure came down after medicines in the ER.  Did have some lower blood pressures through the afternoon evening which was felt to be a combination of blood pressure low in medicines in the ER and pain medication.  From 11:00 p.m. onward blood pressures were controlled.   Patient continued to have severe abdominal pain.  Hemoglobin down to 9.0 from prior 12.4 yesterday.  Creatinine up from 0.9 yesterday to 1.8.  White count up from 8.3 yesterday to 14.4.  INR from 4.3 yesterday to 4.2.  Coumadin was held yesterday.   CT abdomen was repeated. CT abdomen was read as worrisome for necrotic gallbladder and small bile leak Contacted transfer line at hospital.  Surgery accepted and wanted transfer to go through the ER. Patient has PCN allergy.  Surgery said that if reaction was not severe, they wanted Invanz given before she left.  Patient says that she had a itching rash in the 70s.  No trouble breathing or swallowing.  No other reaction.  Dose of Invanz ordered.  IVF were increased.  HPI from hospital: 74 y.o. female who presents with Chief Complaint Patient presents with? Abnormal Scan   Patient presents via EMS as a medical transfer from hospital after having gallbladder necrosis seen on CT imaging.  She was given IV Invanz there.  General surgeon was contacted by that facility and he accepted the patient for transfer to this facility.   Apparently, the patient began having abdominal pain yesterday. Timing of onset was gradual.  Severity is rated as severe at maximum intensity. Quality is described as aching abdominal pain.  Symptoms have been improved after IV pain medicine.  Symptoms worsen with nothing, and improve with IV pain medicine.     History was provided by patient, EMS, transfer paperwork and EMR, and I spoke with treating doctor in general surgery who accepted the patient for transfer.

Then arm became very red, swollen, hot. Arm swelling and redness continued to grow. After 2 more days, redness was 3&#34; in diameter. Saw doctor, who diagnosed as cellulitis. Started me on Keflex 500 mg 4 x day and Benedryl. After 1 more day, redness was 4&#34; in diameter, hot, swollen. Saw doctor again after 4 days (11 days since vaccination) and redness starting to dissipate. Doctor not sure if allergic reaction to vaccine or bacterial infection due to puncture wound from injection. After 14 days from vaccination, redness is almost gone.

Over the next three days the redness moved down my arm, covering an area of 6 inches and nearly all the way around my arm.  The arm was stiff and painful and hot to the touch.  On Monday,  1/25/21, I contacted my primary care doctor.

It itches, is red, but other than the itch it has not bothered me at this point.  I went to a walk-in clinic and was told it could be cellulitis. (bacteria) at the injection site.  He has placed me on an antibiotic starting today.  The rash, swelling on my arm, is hot to the touch and I prefer non-one touch it.  The physician at the walk in said to add heat to the site.  I have also gotten a cough.   He prescribed something for this also.  My Covid case was very mild.

I would guess 10 minutes after the shot my lymph nodes on both sides under my jaw were swelling and my ears felt stuffed up, under pressure.  I tried swallowing and it felt a little harder than it should.  All of these symptoms cleared in four or five hours, except for the headache which had diminished by the end of the day.

Patient was told to wait in car for an additional 30 minutes before leaving.  EMS advised pt to report to ER if symptoms get worse. Patient signed a declination for EMS. I checked on the patient again before her 30 minutes were up. She c/o her throat hurting. EMS attended her again and advised her to go to the ER either by them or POV. Husband of patient stated he would take her to the ER.  Patient left by POV @ 1345.

Woke me around 3:00 AM, lasted 2 days. 3rd day felt washed out and hollow, head still feels swollen.  Unable to move out of bed for 2 days due to pain. Drank lots and lots of water to flush out of system. Am in between doctors right now  and was to out of things to call anybody.  Don&#39;t really want the 2nd vaccination due to the more severe effects 2nd doses are having on others. COVID symptoms twice in my life is more then enough.

I got chills. they noth went away after day 2. On february 6th, around 6:30pm I felt a pinch or jab in my left arm and it was very itchy! I rolled up my sleeve and where the shot had been administered was knotted and very hot! I went and got some ice. i did NOT take any medicine. the ice helped. I went to bed at 11pm and I took a photo of the injection site and it was still very red and very hot. I applied a cold wet wash cloth to it. on Sunday morning I woke up and my arm felt hot again and the red dot and knot was still there but there was an additional red lump/circle below the injection site. I couldn&#39;t wear a long sleeve shirt. there was swelling. it was irritated and itchy. the next day my arm was red but the first knot was gone. the second knot was larger and still warm. I woke up this morning (Tues) the color is fading but its still a large lump and sore and warm.

                                                Had no reaction to 1st dose of Moderna COVID vaccine 1/6/2021.  2nd dose Moderna COVID vaccine 2/4/2021 had no immediate reaction but developed fever and fatigue that lasted 36 hr 1 d after vaccination.  On 2/7  had redness and local swelling at site of injection.  Next day 2/8 rash on chest then broke out face, neck , abdomen, back.  Was seen in local ER where she was diagnosed with an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  Treated Solumedrol, Toradol, lorazepam, Benadryl  and Pepcid and dishcarged with Rx for Prednisone and advised to continue Benadryl and Pepcid.  Rash worsened, became purple and morbilliform on face, arms, legs, back and abdomen over next 3 d.  Was seen by PCP on 2/11.  Prednisone increased to 40 mg x 3 d.  Rash improved with this and was resolving by the time I examined her on 2/15/2021.  Face was beginning to peel but had no  mucosal surface involvement.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine she felt a tingling/little something going down into her hand, but she did not think about it being the shot and did not report it.  Then went home, took a Tylenol and that afternoon her arm was sore like the normal reaction.  She went to bed, woke up at 1:00 AM and her arm was killing her/hurting.  She got up and went to the bathroom and noticed that her hand was swollen and the veins on the top of her hand were protruding.  She looked in the mirror and noticed that the left side of her neck was swollen.  Then she took her temperature and it was elevated, her normal is 97 and it was 99.  Later on that day on Saturday the inflammation got better.  She did not take anything for it.   The symptoms have progressively gotten better and now her hand is normal, her neck this morning looked normal and her temperature is back to her baseline.

I saw my PCP on Feb. 24 and showed the vaccine site to her.  She prescribed an antibiotic, Cephalexin, for a 10 day course. She also suggested using an OTC cortizone creme for the itch.

There has not been enough publicity or information provided about this side effect, which can be worrisome, especially to women. I had to do my own research to learn that this might continue for another two weeks and that I shouldn&#39;t get a mammogram until a few weeks after my second dose. This swollen lymph node might even be present when I get my second dose March 13, so I&#39;m left wondering how that second dose might further impact lymph nodes that are already swollen. Please, please, add more information about this side effects to all your brochures, patient information, etc. Thank you.

                                                Following the vaccine she felt a little dizzy, a little achy.  the 2nd day around noon felt really bad, was in the library and had to leave.  She went home, laid down and took her temp which was 100.8, this was after taking Tylenol that morning.  She went to bed early, got up to take Tylenol during the night.  The next morning on 3/7/21 had soreness in the breast area, the lymph nodes in the arm were very sore to the point that she could not wear a bra.   These symptoms also have gone and is still a little tired but otherwise doing better.

                                                I began having a reaction on the evening of 2/19 with a sore arm and scratchy throat. The next morning, I developed shaking chills, slight nausea, headache, and low grade temp 99-100. I also noticed swollen glands and muscle aches and pain in my back. That lasted about 28 hours. After that I had nerve pain in my neck and all my teeth were painful. I went to bed. I have fibromyalgia so I thought that I may be triggered into a flare. The acute symptoms subsided in a few days, but I then had  intermittent sudden nerve pain, cold spells and hot flashes, a recurrence of irritable bowel like symptoms, with occasional diarrhea (uncharacteristic for my IBS-C). I had to visit my osteopath (for osteopathic manipulation) twice in two weeks for the pain.  She suggested that my symptoms were more than a typical flare and that I should report to VAERS. Yesterday, 3/9 I began to feel exhausted. Last night I had severe systemic  itching that kept me awake much of the night. Today the fatigue continues along with temperature dysregulation. I have contacted my PCP and am awaiting an appointment confirmation.

On February 27, I had pain and swelling in both hands and arms from the elbows to the fingertips. On February 28th, I had severe pain, stiffness, and swelling in both hands and arms from the elbows to the fingertips. I called my primary care physician who told me to go the the ER at the hospital. I was treated in the hospital by doctor and given prescriptions for prednisone, pain medication, and nausea. Doctor said that the second shot could have triggered my symptoms. I was referred to rheumatology provider. I saw a doctor on March 10th. The pain was gone at the time of my appointment, but it returned on March 13th.

                                                arm began to swell within 1/2 hour of receiving vaccine.  started to become painful during the evening of march 1 and woke me during the night.  pain continued for several days.  I applied an ice pack to the injection site for the first 24-36 hours.   approx.  4 to 5 days after vaccine, the palms and fingers of both hands turned very red and kind of mottled and there was some puffiness.   Feeling of being tired continues.  I am very hesitant to get the second dose of this Moderna vaccine.
