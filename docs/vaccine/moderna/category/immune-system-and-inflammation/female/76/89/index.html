                                                Delayed rash on arm at injection site. On the 8th day following vaccination, I developed a circular red rash, slight swelling, hot, vaguely itchy.  The circle was about 2 inches diameter.  Over the next two days, although the swelling abated, the rash expanded down and around my arm. I am now in my third day of having the rash. Now , the rash is about 6 inches down my arm  Like her, I am wondering whether I should have the second dose of the vaccine.

The EMT&#39;s came, checked my lungs, etc.  and talked me through the episode which lasted about 15 minutes.  Then the swelling subsided.  I suspect it had, because I had dermal fillers approximately a year ago.  I had no other adverse affects, except for tiredness that evening.  People should be warned about this because it is a frightening event.  I have never had an adverse reaction to a vaccine before.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Ten days after the injection of Covid 19 injection my arm swelled up, and became very red and itchy at the site of the injection.  It just came up out of nowhere it seems as I had no reaction at all to the vaccine during the prior 10 days since the vaccination. This continued for two days.  The first day after it happened I felt tired and weak in the morning.  I got into work here at the house and the weakness went away.  I treated the itchy situation with Clobetasol Propionate Cream which I had here and was prescribed by my dermatologist for poison ivy.  That took away the itchy situation that was very annoying.  Two days into it the swelling began to go down.  Today is the 4th day since the problem occurred and there is no swelling and only a slight redness.  I am assuming that I can take injection #2 on February 9 as scheduled.

                                                Itchy rash at injection site, started one week after 1st Covid inoculation (Jan 24).  Still present as of Jan. 29, 2021.  Lymph node under arm is swollen and sore.  Rash is not infected, only itchy.  Saw doctor Jan 26 who said it was either cellulitis or shingles.  Saw second doctor Jan 27 recognized it as Covid arm.  I wish this had been noted as a side effect on the web.  I could have saved myself both the cost and potential Covid exposure from two different doctors&#39; visits.  Also, it would be nice to know if this is a delayed allergic reaction to vaccine components or a beneficial reaction by the immune system.

About 5 days after the soreness went  away I developed a rash on my arm. My arm was hot and swollen.  I went to an urgent care the same day I noticed the rash, they put me on steroid and antibiotic Cephalexin. They also sent me to the ER for an ultrasound to make sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  It is normal now. Besides the rash I felt fine otherwise.

                                                When I woke up the next morning my arm was super red and itchy, throughout the day it got swoller, redder and developed a fever.  About 12n my daughter took the temp of my arm and it was 102 so we made ice packs to help with the pain and swelling.  Later she went an bought Cortisone and used the ice packs and Cortisone for about 3 or 4 days when the arm finally begin to get better.  My arm was so painful it was almost unbareable to touch.

Patient reported that it was periodically itchy and she has been scratching it. She stated that yesterday (day 9 after vaccination) that she noticed the size of the redness had increased. She said it was still periodically itchy and only slightly tender to the touch. She said she felt otherwise fine no systemic effects reported. Patient had not taken anything. Recommended benadryl and icing the area. Treatment outcome unknown at this time.

                                                On February 14, I had used the handlebar rotation exercise of a stationery bike for 5 minutes.  The next day I noticed a large swelling about the size of half a pear on the muscle where my Moderna injection was done.  It was as hard as a nut, red, and warm and itchy with a red rash around it.  I saw an urgent care medical person and was told it was probably a reaction to the exercise and that sometimes that happens after an injection.  I was told to use cold compresses, hydrocortison cream, and rest it.  I did this, for 5 days, but  though the swelling subsided, the rash continued to move around and down my arm.  I went back to urgent care on February 19 and was told that it looked better.  I was offered prednazone for it, but declined since I was still on Budesonide .  I was told it would probably clear up over the weekend.  On February 22  it hadn&#39;t cleared up so I saw  a PC.  She  noted the rash  had spread, but swelling had gone down.  She checked my lymph node under my left arm and noticed it was swollen.  She said it was most likely due to a mild infection in the arm where I had  received the vaccination.  She  prescribed  a Zpack and after 2 days, all symptoms were gone and I felt so much better.  This event happened 10 days after my vaccination.

                                                Almost exactly 24 hours after 2nd shot, my mom was getting her hair done and she started breathing hard.  Hairstylist removed her mask and she then passed out.  Called 911.  They observed my mom sweating, her lips and hands were swollen, she was slack jawed, pale and clammy.   After several minutes she came out of it.  Was given a piece of candy thinking it was a sugar low, but her sugar was high 285 @9:00am.  Her color was still pale and she was still incoherent.  While still on with 911, she became more lucid and said she was feeling better, so ambulance was canceled.   I drove her home and checked her sugar @11:00 - 295 and BP 125/55 pulse 75.  She stayed with me for the rest of Saturday.  Her sugar was still high Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  Upon checking her blood sugar log, her sugar had gone up for a week following the first shot.

The next morning I woke up and the rash was there, and spread over the different areas of body. I was sweating bad, muscle pain, joint pain, and nauseated for about 3 days. I had knots in my arms. I went to the doctor last week, and she gave me a shot in the hip, it helped with the swelling.  Then I called her back and she called in a cream for me.  The other symptom remaining is the rash at the injection site, I have been putting the cream on it twice a day, taking Benadryl and Tylenol for pain

Was quite concerning but did not call doctor although I sure thought about it. I was wondering if I was actually infected with Covid- 19. Shot was Tuesday 2: 30 PM, felt a bit better by Thursday but arm still hurt even on Friday arm was red and swollen down to my elbow. Saturday fine. I thought someone should know about this as lost of my friends also had difficult reactions. But this was the first time I saw an opportunity to respond.

                                                Aside from the expected sore right arm, I developed painful welling of underarm glands (right side) which I&#39;ve NEVER had before even as a child; also developed itching and some redness and swelling at injection site,. These occurred in late afternoon on 3/5/2021 - a day after 2nd Moderna vaccine injection.  I also developed a low fever for part of the same afternoon (3/5) into early eve. I also had some ache in center chest (gone now) which I never had before (angina?).   It is now 3/6/2021 and I still have swollen underarm glands (right arm), right arm soreness at injection site, and some itching there as well. But no fever just now.  I&#39;m VERY CONCERNED the swollen glands will not go away in time for my aortic valve replacement surgery on 3/15/2021.

I put Benadryl spray on the place as well as Benadrly by mouth. Next day the rash went all the way to the elbow and was swollen. Today at 11 days it is still red but doesn&#39;t itch as much. It seems to be getting better.

It seems to have gotten larger and currently is approx 1&#34; in diameter. My physician is having me follow-up with tests as to what is going on with it and to determine whether it is a  swollen lymph gland resulting from the Covid 19 immunizations, or something else. She has assessed it as a &#34;Submandibular lyphaedenopathy&#34; thus far as of unknown origin and the tests are to &#34;evaluate the submandibular node&#34;, I am setting up for testing tomorrow and she will receive reports of their evaluations and any further actions to be taken.

The patient&#39;s medical history included breast cancer in the right breast. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included cholesterol medication and once weekly Fosamax with calcium and vitamin D.   On 10-MAR-2021, the patient received a dose of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 026A21A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Mar 2021, immediately following the vaccination, the patient reported she experienced overheating, became beet red and her blood pressure was over 300. An ambulance took her to the emergency room. She had her troponin levels checked which were over 4000 that lead to a hospital admission and required a unspecified catherization. The patient was discharged home on unspecified date. She reported still feeling groggy and having difficulty with her cognition but it was improving throughout the day. The patient also reported her arm was still swollen, but improving.   Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine and other unspecified medications and treatments.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The events, blood pressure over 300 and troponin over 4,000, were considered recovering.   The events, flushing beet red, overheating, and grogginess were considered not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                After i had my injection about 7 hours later about 4-5 o&#39;clock I was sitting in a chair and I got up and my balance was completely off and I almost fell into glass table. I felt very foggy and my head wasn&#39;t right. I had to hold on to things and I sat down and I kept saying I just didn&#39;t feel right.  I called my daughter and my arm was hurting and I figure that&#39;s what happens, I was getting so tired and really bad headaches. My daughter asked somebody and they told me to take extra strength Tylenol (500 mg ) 2 at a time 6 hour intervals. Which i did i got up the next morning and i had to go back to bed i had no energy. I felt horrible. When i did get up in the afternoon all of a sudden i had horrible chills and that day in Florida it was 82 degrees and i put the heat on 84 and i was extremely shaky and cold. I went back to bed and later i did have a fever, not highs, it only went to 100.8 but during the evening it did break because my sheets were almost saturated. Yesterday morning 1/27 Wednesday i felt better, fever had gone down, pain was still there in my arm and swelling. I thought that was natural. In the afternoon i decided to take a shower and i noticed my left arm around the injection site was a red rash about 7inches long and 4-5 inches wide which  i had to seen before i called my primary doctor just to make sure this was normal around injection site and talked to the nurse and she thought it was normal. But if there was no changes to call her back on Friday. Last night not able to sleep i saw an article that said COVID arm rash seen after Moderna vaccine, annoying but harmless it was a large article and it made me feel better but there were only 14 examples but they believe there were more because they were younger people with the health dept. that received this vaccine. It said in 1week it should go away.

                                                I received my injection on 1/25/2021 I had my second COVID shot, everything went well, I just had a little pain and swelling and was fine. About 7 hours later i got up from chair and i was dizzy and my balance was off and i almost fell into table. I didn&#39;t feel right. I went and sat back down and i was very tired and i started getting headache. I called my daughter and a nurse she knows told me to take extra strength Tylenol 500 mg take 2 every 6 hours. I started at 730 and went until 130. I slept on and off and got up Tuesday and my arm was still hurting. I was very tired and had no energy. When i got up later in the afternoon i had extreme chills. It was 83 degrees in Florida nd i turned heat up to 84 and i was still shaking. I got under covers and had a fever it was 100.8. Went to sleep that night and fever broke. Got up Wednesday and felt a little better, still had headache and tired. Decided to take a shower. I noticed my left arm where the injection was was all red. 6-7 inches long and about 5 inches wide which i never saw before. after shower I called my PCP I contacted the nurse said she thought it was normal and if there was no  change to call her back on Friday. my arm is still red and warm i went to sleep but couldn&#39;t sleep. I saw an article about COVID arm rash seen after Modern vaccine and now i know that&#39;s what I had. I feel better after I read it in the magazine today and it said it will only last a week. This should be listed as a side effect so nobody else wonders what it is. I drank so much water because it said to drink plenty of water and i tried to use arm as much as possible.

Went to urgent care doctor and was told there was an infection from the shot or a reaction from the shot. Doctor gave my an injection of Rocephin 1g IM. I was prescribed 500MG of Keflex PO 3 times per day. Symtoms got worce and went back to primary care doctor. Doctor stated that I should continue with the same treatment and return for further tests if  the condition did not get better.

                                                I awoke on 1/23/2021 (Saturday) morning to find my face and especially my lips swollen.  Contacted doctor&#39;s office for the on-call; he strongly suggested I visit the ER. Was kept there for 2-3 hours for observation.  Was considered &#34;hypertensive,&#34;  routine blood work done (CBC, metabolic panel) all of which were normal.  Was given Prednisone and ZyrTec.   After no change in my condition, was discharged with instruction to contact primary physician and continue to take Prednisone and ZyrTec for the next four more days.   The reason for the facial and lip swelling could not be determined......It was indicated that the swelling could be one of several things including an allergic reaction to something topical like a lip balm (I used a Blistix application before bed), a reaction to one of my medication (BP med-Olmesartan, which they told me to discontinue) or less likely a reaction to the COVID vaccine.

                                                Approx 39 hrs. after vaccination woke to swelling on bottom left lip.  Thought is was the beginning of a cold sore.  Approx 2 hrs. later woke  again to right side of face swollen.  Felt like when you get novacine at dentist office.  About 2 hrs after that got up and felt top lip swollen, bottom right side had gone down.  At about 3PM face then begain to swell on left.  All swelling stayed except where it began on bottom right lip rest of day.  Throughout the day on Sunday, swelling started to go down.  Still swollen on Monday going down as the day went on.  at this time 6:47PM is it about 90% gone.  Just on bottom of cheeks and the right one is noticeably less swollen than the left.

Then about 8 days later, just over a week she woke up and her arm was red again and more swollen and looked like a black and blue area where the needle went in.  There was a red rash around that point.  The rash was larger than the palm of her hand.  She was tired that day and it did go away after 2-3 days.  She took Tylenol one night due to the pain to help sleep.  She did not call her doctor.  It has now totally resolved as of today, 2/10/21.

Around it had some little smaller redness, not raised that were blotchy all over.  It was a little itchy and when she touched it it was a little warm.  It was not a real bad reaction, but did not feel sick just the redness.  The next day it itched more and took a Benadryl, and about 2 days later it started to fade, but did merge together and got lighter and lighter in color and is almost completely gone.  it is not itching anymore and is light pink.

                                                I took the first shot of Moderna?s COVID-19 vaccine  the middle of January. Two and a half weeks later, I developed a two inch rash above my right breast even though it didn?t itch or burn, if pressed, it hurt. I treated it with antibiotic ointment and calamine lotion. During that time, I experienced tiredness, exhaustion, sluggishness as well as aches around the right shoulder. I went to get a mammogram where they told me my lymph nodes were swollen on the right side under my arm. They had seen adults who had taken the shot develop swollen lymp nodes  which made it necessary to retake the mammogram. I also went to the dermatologist to see what the inch rash was, he took a biopsy, and it turned out it was shingles even though I had had the shingles shots a year before.

                                                This event , because so many elderly people have the fillers in their knees should be widely publicized! We have fillers that help so much to be able to walk without pain, but this vaccine has caused me to have extreme pain and burning and not be able to walk without pain for 4 days now. NO ONE has said anything about how this Moderna vaccine would  affect us because of the Hyaronolic Acid injections to our knees. We should have been allowed to get Pfizer!!!! I am so upset about this and extremely disappointed in our government&#39;s lack of disclosure.

She was lying in bed, her heart was hurting to the point that she could not move it.  Around 8:00 she put the electric blanket on, got warm but she would still get a cold chill like she had ice water in her veins.  Was this way all night.  She had a fever, the swelling on her arm.  She did not throw up but just the chills, fever.  She tossed and turned all night until about 3:30 this morning. She then took 1/2 of  Tylenol, dozed off.  She is still cold, not as cold as she was.  The arm is also still sore.

From slightly painful first 2 days to just a little itchy by 5 day- today.  Painful arm a few hours after injection, which mostly ebbed, with the redness starting about 7-8 days after injection, becoming somewhat tender, with that ebbing by 5 day.  On third day ( 8 days after vaccine) Urgent care diagnosed it as a seondary infection and prescribed doxycycline.   Dr. said had never seen anything like it.  Took the antibiotic for 2 days and stopped.  Med seemed to make no difference.

Then upon getting up about 6:00 am, my arm was swollen and warm and I had a red rash at the shot site. It get more and more painful to touch but then after three days the swelling started to go down but i also notice that my neck glands and under my arm were also feeling discomfort. I thought it was almost gone except for the glands in my neck but then, last night, March 16th I realized I still had or that a new rash was again on the same area and is still a bit swollen and sore but not as bad as on the 10th. I am really worried about taking the 2nd shot I have a daughter who is having a heart transplant and deaf and she needs me to be in the hosp. with her to interpret for her.

I have had Rotator Cuff repair twice on Rt. Shoulder and the pain I feel there is like it is in my rotator cuff. I cannot lift my arm up above my waist without feeling the pain. When I do not use my arm, there is not pain. I do not have a rash any longer but feel there must be swelling in the shoulder. Ocassionally I have some itching in injection area but try not to scratch at all.

I debated calling 911, but had sick animals I couldn&#39;t leave. Went to bed and when I woke, I could swallow again. However I had severe hives as well as debilitation itching and swelling of my fingers, hands and later, my toes and feet as well. These symptoms have continued in varying degrees ever since I received my first Moderna vaccination.

At approximately 7 days post injection she began to have another localized reaction that included reddness, swelling, pain, heat, and a dry skin tecture that progressed to cover the lateral aspect of upper left arm from shoulder to elbow. At time of examination by RN, the patient reports that size and intensity have been increasing for about 7 days.  Patient finds relief in hot shower.  No other treatments attempted at time of exam. Patient reported area may be improving, but she is unsure.   Area was outlined with marker by RN and patient was advised to see PCP for treatment if area increased in size and was not continuing to improve.  Counseled on using OTC benadryl cream if there was itching.

On January 28 the evening and 8 noticed some redness.  She saw me, her doctor, on January 29.  She had a 7 x 7 cm round pink area that was slightly warm and minimally tender.  This was at the site of injection.  It was slightly swollen. I did not give her the vaccine.  She got it through the health Department.

Her lips did not appear swollen, she had no shortness of breath, no rash or hives.  The patient has a prior history of allergic reactions to shrimp and other injectables (not specified).    Per the patient, by the time I spoke with her, her symptoms were already resolving.  Her vital signs were recorded and reported to Doctor on duty.  Instructions were received to continue monitoring the patient and she could be discharged when her symptoms were completely resolved.  After an additional 20 minutes, per the patient, her symptoms were all gone and &#34;felt fine&#34;.  The patient was discharged to home.  Patient left the clinic by wheelchair accompanied by her family member.  She was instructed to call 911 if her symptoms worsened and/or contact her primary physician.  The patient was asymptomatic upon discharge.

Top of foot and all along the outside side of it both on top and at bottom of foot all very painful. Ankle and leg very swollen and painful. Can&#39;t walk on foot.  As of 2/26/2021  swelling is not as bad and not so discolored but still some swelling and redness burning and very painful and still cannot use the foot.  Also have noticed places where  I have had surgery or injuries is hurting and being stiff. Am questioning whether or not I should get the 2nd shot. Concerned it will make situation even worse.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 04-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown), intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Feb-2021, approximately 48 hours after vaccination, the patient developed allergic reaction and had hives all over her body. The patient received diphenhydramine for hives. The patient also stated that inside of her was burning, face swelled up, lips swelled up and throat swelled up. The patient rushed to emergency room (ER). They needed to take the patient to an allergist because they wanted to find out if this was related to the vaccine. The allergist told her that they couldn&#39;t do an allergy testing. The patient asked if there were any reports on people showing allergic reaction 48 hours later after the vaccine. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, allergic reaction, hives all over her body, face swelled up, lips swelled up, throat was swelled up, and burning, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Feb.8, 2021 leg was continuing to swell.  went to doctor&#39;s office where he prescribed an ultrasound.  Was told there was a clot behind my left knee and in some of the smaller veins.  I had the chills, joint pains all over, which lasted about the three weeks, but was slightly different every day.  When I began the 20 mg dose of Xarelto, every symptom cleared up and I felt great.  I am continuing on the 20 mg Xarelto.

                                                On 8th day after Moderna Covid 19 injection, there was a very raised, red area on left arm - felt very warm.  By the next day  the area had increased in size and some of the swelling had subsided.  Today, the third day after the reaction appeared, the redness has spread to  a large part of the outside of my upper arm - still feels warm -slight pain.  Previous to this side effect, I felt a loss of strength in my left arm during a workout. ( My concern is that this occurred so late after the injection and what it means going forward with second injection.) I have called my doctor but have not talked to him.

                                                Vaccine shot taken on 1/29/21 in the morning.  Normal vaccine shot soreness for 2 days.  2/6/21 at 7:00 itching and redness at injection site.  White spot at injection.  Swelling and itching increased throughout the following day.  Treated with cold compress and Cortisone ointment.  No change. Spoke with my physician on 2/8/21 at 1:00 P.M.  She suggested Benedryl (sp?) ointment for the itching and said to contact her if there were any further symptoms.  The rash and itching are still with me today 2/9/21.  I am hoping that from what little information is available that the rash and itching should start to abate within the next day or 2.

Her cheeks were swollen, she felt that maybe her tongue was as well.  She got the liquid Benadryl and let it stay there and it helps that feeling.  She had taken the Zyrtec and Singulair the night before.  She did the inhaler puff in the morning, the feeling did not go away.  She then took the Ventolin and it seemed to calm down.   The symptoms then went away and didn&#39;t come back, and thought that she was ok.   She felt bad for about a week and a half like she wanted to sleep all the time, but did what she had to do.  She is fine now.

                                                I had very little reaction to the first fax on Feb. 11 other than a slight fever and extreme fatigue through the 3rd day.  However, on the 9th day after the vax, I got &#34;COVID Arm&#34; which included upper arm swelling, red, itchy and achey at the vax site and another few days of extreme fatigue.  Today (18 days after vax) I am no longer fatigued, felt good when I woke up and I am finally getting some energy back.  The redness, swelling and itching is subsiding but is not gone totally and there is only a slight discomfort in my arm.  Moderna Vaccination #2 is on March 11 and it will be in my other arm.  Only took Aleve twice for pain.

I ALSO FELT A COLD SORE COMING ON.  I TOOK SUDAFED PE AND VALCYCLOVIR, WHICH USUALLY SOLVES THE ISSUE.  THESE SYSMPTOMS CONTINUED AND I CONTINUED WITH SUDAFED AND VALCYCLOVIR.  I SAW MY DENTIST ON FEBRUARY 11 AND WAS TOLD THERE THERE WERE NO ISSUES AND PERHAPS THE PAIN WAS CAUSED BY SINUS ISSUES.  I INCREASED THE VALCYCLOVIR TO THREE TABS A DAY RATHER THAN ONE.  THE TEETH ISSUE SPREAD TO THE LEFT SIDE OF MY  MOUTH AND  TWO MORE COLD SORES APPEARED, ANOTHER ON MY UPPER LIP AND ONE AT THE EDGE OF MY LEFT NOSTRIL.  I HAD A ZOOM MEETING WITH MY DOCTOR ON MARCH 1.  SHE INCREASED THE VALCYCLOVIR TO 1000M. THREE TIMES A DAY.  THE COLD SORES HAVE DISAPPEARED, BUT THE OTHER SYMPTOMS CONTINUE, BUT THE PAIN HAS LESSENED SOMEWHAT.  I TAKE TYLENOL WHEN THE DISCOMFORT BEGINS TO INTERFERE WITH MY DAILY LIFE.

                                                No adverse effects day of injection other than mild soreness at injection site for a day or two. Nine days later my arm was swollen, itchy with center being hot, raised and red. I had no fever and no other noticeable symptoms. The next day it had spread over the upper arm and I went to emergency room. ER Dr. said she thought it was cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic. She advised me to see my primary care provider after the weekend. I went to my primary care provider and the Dr. and the N.P. agreed it was not cellulitis, but an allergic reaction due to it&#39;s appearance . In checking CDC site the Dr. found photos of vaccine reactions which looked identical to my arm. I went off antibiotics and took ibuprofhan and it slowly has returned to almost normal within 10 days.

                                                The injection on the first dose was totally painless. Thus, it was a shock when the injection stung so much at the time it was administered.   The pain in my arm continued  throughout the 12th and 13th necessitating being on pain relievers. By the evening of the 13th , a 3&#34; red swollen area became apparent .  The pain continued which was annoying but did not limit my activities .   I remain puzzled as to why I responded as I did when I hadn&#39;t before; it almost appears I have a cystitis issue now.

                                                Immediate reaction was the headache at the time of the vaccine, and has had headaches on and off but nothing like the initial one.   Started to get dizzy and felt weird on the ride home from the vaccine.  The headache lasted a fairly long time and got tired by the evening and the next morning.  The headache has still continued a  little off and on until now, 2/17/21.  The dizziness has gone away, the feeling &#34;out of it&#34; feeling has gone away, does not feel well about the concentration.  The tiredness and fatigue started the day after the vaccine and has gotten worse, has to drag herself through the day and by 1:00 PM is done through the day due to the fatigue.  Some days can go to 4:00 but most days only lasts until 1:00.  She gets up at 7:30 and today at 10:37 has the feeling of tiredness.  The gland under her arm a couple of weeks ago was swollen, which is still sensitive but not as bad as it was.  The fatigue is the main thing that continues to bother her.  She has not taken anything for these reactions.   She has seen her doctor, and is supposed to get some blood tests today, 2/17/21.

I visited the doctor advised warm compresses and the problem subsided in a few days. After the second dose I woke up in the middle of the night with the chills and chattering teeth. It was uncontrollable shaking. My temperature of 102 degrees in the morning. I had shooting pains in my arms and legs. Felt terrible all day. Took Tylenol no effect. Advil worked better.  The lymph nodes were sore under my arm. On the third day I felt a little better but on the fourth day I felt a little better.

I woke at 2:00am the following morning to go to the restroom and my dog needed to go out.  I felt light headed as soon as she was back in the house.  I felt things going dark and I passed out in the hallway.  I don&#39;t know how long I was out but when I came to, I felt like I couldn&#39;t move.  I laid there for a while and finally crawled back to my bed.  I was able to get back in bed.  By then it was 3:00am.  The next night I woke in the night and had an irregular heartbeat.  I could not get back to sleep until it finally went away.  For several days after the vaccination, I had very little energy.

Ten days after, I woke up to swelling redness and hives covering my upper left arm to the elbow. Waited 24 hours to see if it would disappear and when it didn&#39;t, I then went to the doctors office. I was seen by the nurse/practitioner who gave me a steroid shot  and advised me not to continue with the vaccine program. Everything healed up in a couple of days and I continued with the vaccine program , receiving my second dose on January 28th. with no reaction.

Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

Saw the doctor who gaver her an injection (forget the name) and the predsolone med pack.  The swelling started to go down 2 days after taking this medication. A week after taking the Moderna vaccine and taking this medication her swelling was gone. Medication was started on Wed Jan 21,2012 and completed on Tue Jan 26, 2021. The swelling didn&#39;t get life threatening but when we noticed that inflamation was worsening and Benadryl didnt work we worried and she went to see the doctor for the treatment described above.

Day 7 pm red, swollen , itchy red spot size a little larger than golf ball and slight headache .  This lasted 5 days with red area 31/2? wide and feeling tired and slight headache.  Days 12and 13 all symptoms vanish.  This morning, 2/05/2021 my arm is again 3? area red, itchy, slight headache and fatigue.  I hear that this called Covid arm and seems to affect about  .06 % of those who have had the Moderna vaccine.  I thought I should report this because my husband who had the same injection had no symptoms at all...not even redness at the site.

Her right arm is also red and itchy all the way down to her fingers.  Her daughter called the pharmacy and feared that she might have Bell&#39;s Palsy.  She took her mom to a walk-in clinic.  The doctor&#39;s office blamed the COVID vaccine for her symptoms and said that she is to never receive another COVID vaccination in the future.  I am unaware of the treatments that the patient received

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine I had racing heartbeat for 2 hours. I was short of breath over the next few days. I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

Headache continued for  four days and fever would come and go but usually at night. I did not receive treatment but I did let my cardiologist office know what was going on. When I continued with the headache, I contacted the internist?s office and I only had a TelMed visit with them. My nostrils had something like cold sores but then I started sneezing and realize there was infection also. Had a second TelMed visit with the PA who started me on an anabiotic Amoxicillian. The infection is clearing up in my sinuses but I am coughing a lot. Overall continue to feel very tired and weary

                                                I notice a different feeling in my arm-it seems to be a itching burning sensation.  After a few minutes I pulled up my sleeve and noticed small red spots forming, It  was splotchy  over a  little over an  inch wide and long.  I watched this and it continued but was more annoying than anything.  Later in afternoon it was spreading to a wider area and was showing a brighter redness.  By 11 p.m. the coloring had spread and my upper arm felt warm to the touch and had swollen some.  I slept fairly well, woke up and it had increased in size .  Wednesday  morning  the redness was bright red and much of the upper arm was affected.  I called Dr. office and saw Dr. not my usual doctor..

She stated it was oval in appearance and covered most of the upper arm.  She noted a lump in her underarm of the left axilla also.  Denied any fever or other symptoms and otherwise felt fine.  On 3/9/21 she noticed a lump in the groin area and noticed that walking was a little more difficult than usual since both of her knees bothered her.  3/12/21Pt went to orthopedic surgeon and had a &#34;cortisone injection&#34; in the right knee.   This afternoon, the patient&#39;s daughter suggested that she go a local Urgent Care because the patient stated that the lump (previously in groin area)  &#34;was moving.&#34;  She waited in there for over one hour and then a nurse came out and told her to go to the ED for evaluation of her left upper arm for the redness and swelling.  She went directly to the ED and is being evaluation and having bloodwork done.  Daughter said if the lab results are normal, her mother will be discharged with an oral antibiotic and benadryl

Also on lisinopril for many years with no adverse events to it. Unclear which of these agents caused her swelling. No prior history of dermal fillers or any aesthetic procedures to her face.

                                                Several days after receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine for COVID 19, I began have pain in all the joints in my hands, shoulder.  Unable to use my hands due to excruciating pain.  The pain began  3-4 days after the 2nd shot, starting in 2 of my fingers and progressively moved to all the joints in all of my fingers, wrists and my shoulders.  In addition there is swelling. I have very little use of my hands, requiring assistance to care for myself.  I have never had joint pain in my hands before.  The pain has continued for 2 weeks non-stop.  At the doctors recommendation I have been taking Tylenol for Arthritis, however this does not alleviate the pain, only reduces some of the discomfort.

She said within 3 days her legs started to go numb and especially her thigh muscles and her veins in her left foot were engorged. She said she went to the ER and they rxed 40mg prednisone for 4 days and her papers from the ER read &#34;allergy.&#34;  When I spoke to her for the second time and advised her she does not qualify for a second moderna vaccine, patient said that when she went to the ER she went for abdominal swelling, leg swelling, leg numbness, and swelling of the left ankle and foot. I confirmed with her that her symptoms have all improved and she said &#34;yes, tremendously.&#34; She said she spoke to her PCP and at least one additional doctor yesterday.

By 10:00 p.m. my lower back, sides were in pain and abdominal muscles and stomach were like frozen in place.  Couldn&#39;t move anything and the area seemed to be swollen.  Had  lost appetite in late afternoon so had not eaten dinner, only liquids since figured I needed something.  Couldn&#39;t sleep, aspirin didn&#39;t help.  Next day around  noon my abdominal area was better and pain decreasing  on sides.  Still no desire to eat. Trouble sleeping,   2nd day after shot, still  lower back pain, feel bloated, no desire to eat.  Very little side pain.   Had slight headache   This third night after shot I could finally  sleep.  This fourth day I felt back to normal.  During all this time, the arm that had the shot never really bothered me

                                                Bad headache, very stuffy nose, I couldn&#39;t breathe and almost went to the hospital. Ears were ringing, my eyes were ready to pop out of my head. Temples hurt, lymph glands were swollen, sore throat. Mostly in upper part of anatomy above collar bone. It made me very weak, I had trouble getting out of rocking chair to answer phone. So I took another Tylenol. I usually only take 1-2 Tylenol a day and that was my second one by the middle of the day. I had to lay down and I live alone so I was nervous and had phone beside me and debated calling 911 which I have never done. I dozed and when I woke up about a couple of hours later it was much better. Still had headache and a little stuffiness but anybody can handle that. Also, I was very nauseated and couldn&#39;t eat but I did drink water.

                                                84 yo woman here to follow up from recent episode of vasculitis.   She started getting a rash - started 7 days after 2nd dose of vaccine At last visit, we did testing for vasculitis after the rash looked more vasculitic to me; ANCA testing was positive, as was ANA.  - 17 days after 2nd vaccine She was given prednisone 20 mg taper over the last 8 days.  She is feeling much better in terms of her rash and swelling.   She is having surgery on the 29th for her BCC on the left eyelid. She is noticing blurred vision in both eyes since this all started and she is mentioning this to the eye doctor when she sees them. She says her head was fuzzy when this started and this is better but is still &#34;fuzzy sometimes&#34; Her renal function was normal.  Her CBC was mildly elevated WBC but otherwise normal.  She denies any breathing problems, blood in stools or blood in urine, or neurologic symptoms other than the fuzzy head.

                                                This patient developed the onset of forearm swelling and redness 1 week (onset 1/28/2021) after receiving COVID-19 vaccine. There was no redness induration or other findings at the immunization site, all findings were distal to the elbow, and they included a very mild erythematous streak from the antecubital fossa to the wrist as well as mild to moderate edema on the volar aspect of the forearm. The symptoms were improving with Tylenol and application of topical Aspercreme at the patient had started prior to my evaluation on 2/1/2021.I could not explain the relationship to her vaccination, but felt it necessary due to the timing and fact it was in the same extremity as the immunization was given that I should report this

                                                Patient presented to the ED 2/15/2021 for shortness of breath and lightheadedness with near syncopal event. The pt reported 2 episodes of SOB and lightheadedness, with the second one as the more severe. On her second episode, she felt severe shortness of breath, tried to walk quickly to her bed with her walker, and fell into her bed. CT angio demonstrated acute saddle PE, mild right heart strain, RUL pulmonary infarct, and mild multifocal pneumonia with suspicion of COVID; IR was consulted and suggested thrombectomy due to the severity of the embolism. In the ED, she was started on heparin drip and put on low-flow NC oxygen without distress. Upon arrival to the emergency department her vital signs were significant for T 36.4, SBP 120/81, HR 95 bpm, NSR, RR 18, FiO2 94% on room air.  Her oxygen increased to 98% on 2 L nasal cannula.  Her laboratory values revealed WBCs 15.1, Hb 14.4, HCT 43.4, PLT 321, neutrophils 68.8%, D-dimer 4642, NA 134, K3.4, anion gap 9, BUN 17, creatinine 1.00, glucose 163, troponin elevated 0.12, 0.25, and 0.41, urinalysis is unremarkable, COVID-19 swab is positive. A thrombectomy was performed 2/16/2021.  She tested COVID positive on 2/16/2021 and her SpO2 remains in the high 90s with dips to mid 80s while talking, but she does not currently experience any SOB.

                                                After approximately 5 days began developing rash and swelling at injection site, so-called &#34;Covid Arm&#34;.  Swelling, some pain, and significant itching in a patch some 4 to 5 inches in extent.  Gave her some over-the-counter antihistamine (Claritin) and this helped to resolve the symptoms somewhat.  Redness had abated somewhat by the end of the day.  I am reluctant to give her too much of the antihistamine due to dizziness and increased lack of mental clarity (she suffers from Alzheimer&#39;s).  Being a military wife, she has had many vaccinations, but has never had a reaction like this before.

Patient had blood taken at her appointment and was waiting when the nurse came back out and said her blood had clotted so they needed to redraw her blood. She states this has never happened before and wondered if her blood clotting would have been due to her covid vaccine the week prior. She states the first girl who drew her blood was slower than the second time around when a different nurse drew her blood.

                                                On Saturday while getting your night medicines from the shelf, and started feeling dizzy, tried to reach the shelf and said to herself that &#34;i can&#39;t do it, I just can&#39;t do it&#34;.  She staggered back and sat down on a towel hamper and apparently fell off of that onto the floor, lost kidney function.  Tried to get up and managed to get her phone out and called her husband (he&#39;s hard of hearing - was downstairs).  She said when he got there her head was towards the bathroom door and felt that he could not get in and could not get her up so she tried to get up.  She did not have any strength.  Finally she got up to get on her elbow and crawled into the vanity area and raised up and pulled herself up.  She did not enough strength to walk to the bed.   She got to the bed and then started with chills, turned on her electric blanket.  She felt better Sunday, 1/7/21, and is real shaky today.  She feels a little stronger but is not back to where she wants to be.  Yesterday evening she felt her arm itching a little bit, and looked at it and it was swollen and red, and had an area about the size of her hand.  Her husband felt of it and said that he felt she had fever in it.  The arm was sore to touch.  It is itching a little bit this morning.  She had a headache for a couple of days as well, took a Tylenol one night and her head felt real weird.  It was not real severe, and it hurt more times than it did others.  It would come and go.  Has not taken anything else for these symptoms.   Her husband checked her BP, Friday was 108/62, and last night 106/67.

Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna vaccine IM left deltoid on January 23, 2021 and the next week developed redness, discomfort and swelling in the left arm. She had seen her dermatologist that week for another issue and the dermatologist was so concerned that she described Keflex. The patient was afraid to take the Reflex as she has a PCN allergy so she presented to  Urgent care. She has a cellulitis in the arm.  She has antihistamine a home and took one last night. I advised her to take it nighty until resolves and to start Clindamycin  po TID x 10 days to treat cellulitis and also may take Famotidine prescribed by her physician which she had not started yet and may use OTC cortisone cream on area.

                                                Patient  seen and evaluated by PA-C. with myself.  We agreed on the clinical findings and implemented our plan together.  Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time. Please see MDM section and the rest of the note for further information on patient assessment and treatment.
