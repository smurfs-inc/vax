                                                Patient received vaccine around 430pm. As she was sitting for post-vaccine observation she told an associate to call over Rph due to side effects. After speaking with patient she stated that her arm was numb (vaccinated arm) and that it hurt more than when she got her flu shot. I assessed both arms an her vaccinated arm was slightly swollen. I described the signs of anaphylaxis to her and told her that i would like for her to stay longer for extra monitoring and to alarm me or one of my associates if any anaphylaxis symptoms occur. Patients blood pressure was taken reading - 132/96. Patient was unsure of her baseline so i explained i will check again shortly. Patient was given water and one dose of Benadryl (25mg) at 5:25pm as well as an ice pack to place on her arm. At 6:00pm patients blood pressure was retaken (124/82) and patient stated she was well enough to go home. Her grandma was with her and stated she didn&#39;t have Benadryl at home, I recommend her to get some and gave the patient another dose (25mg) before her grandma took her home.  Patient has no primary care physician.

                                                Approximately 7-8 minutes after receiving the vaccine, started to feel light-headed, thought she was going to pass out, and her heart was racing extremely high. The health care team at the site took her blood pressure, measured heart rate, gave her water, juice and chocolate and tried to get her heart rate to drop. It was fluctuating up and down and she couldn&#39;t stand up without dizziness;  we waited 45 minutes and then drove her home as she was unable to drive her own car.  She was experiencing significant lightheadedness, and consistent heart racing even while lying down on the sofa/bed. This continued for several days and she stayed home from school and sports. We called her primary care doctor on the 10th and they suggested she wait another day to see how she was feeling. She started to feel a bit better by Friday, was still experiencing a bit of the tiredness, nauseous, light-headed and heart spikes, but was able to drive, move around.  On Sunday evening, she started to experience increased heart rate again, lymph nodes were very painful and started experiencing the light headedness all evening.  On Monday we took her to her primary care provider and they then referred her to ER for the heart racing and a EKG. The increased light headedness, feeling like she will pass out even while laying in bed, dizziness has all increased and her lymph nodes continue to be swollen and painful. It has been over a week since the vaccine and there is no clear sign of her reaction getting any better, if not worse.  The EKG results indicated a new abnormality and we are trying to get her to a cardiologist.  She is and had been a very healthy, varsity athlete that runs over 30 hours a week with track, and since receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine is unable to move very far within the house without feeling that she is going to pass out or that her heart rate is shooting up uncontrollably.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported.).    On 09-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 09-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS POSTURAL (patient cannot walk with out dizziness) (seriousness criterion disability), DIZZINESS (Dizziness with room spinning) and BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Unstable blood pressure). On 13-Feb-2021, the patient experienced LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes). On an unknown date, the patient experienced GAIT INABILITY (Cannot even walk around normally). At the time of the report, DIZZINESS POSTURAL (patient cannot walk with out dizziness), DIZZINESS (Dizziness with room spinning), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Unstable blood pressure), GAIT INABILITY (Cannot even walk around normally) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 09-Feb-2021, Heart rate: increased (High) increased.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       Relevant Text: The Patient&#39;s mother reported that the patient received their first dose on 9 Feb 2021 and approximately 10 minutes post receiving the vaccine the patient developed severe dizziness and had an increase in their heart rate. The patient also had an unstable blood pressure.  Few days later, the patient developed swelling in their lymph nodes. The reporter reported that the symptoms were still ongoing and now the patient cannot even walk without dizziness. It was also reported that the patient cannot even get back to the competitive sports and was not able to walk around anymore normally. The patient had multiple visits to the cardiologist, ENT, and pediatrician with no clear explanation of what happened to the patient.  No Concomitant product use was reported.  No treatment information was provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Looking at the clinical scenario, the event postural dizziness is persisting 6wks from onset with no clear explanation, it is assessed as a SAE (disability). However, medical history and concomitant medications, reports of tests/diagnostics are needed for further assessment. Additional information is requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She was experiencing extreme fatigue, substantially enlarged lymph nodes, a slight sore throat and mild sinus stuffiness.  Depending on the thermometer used, she either had no fever or a very low grade fever (less than 100).

Within 10 minutes, her arm  was in severe pain and her left hand was cool and mottled. She was transported to the ER and was diagnosed with &#34;lymphadenopathy reaction&#34; and was sent home.

                                                The first day, I had slight arm soreness with nothing more. When I woke up on day two, I noticed my arm had swelled more than usual (basing off my previous dose in my right arm) and was extremely hot, tender, and had two circular red patches. That night, the redness and swelling had spread into a medium sized circle, and began to itch and still be very hot upon touch. Upon looking later that night, at approximately 11pm EST, the swelling and redness had gotten larger.  On day three, the redness only got worse, and is slowly spread more over the area, with intense itching, but no longer is as sore as it was the day prior. I have iced the area, moved my arm around more to help the swelling go down, taken a hot shower, and about 600mg of Ibuprofen each day since the second dose. The only outcome to those treatments has been a significant decrease in pain level, but the swelling and redness still continues. This has all been over about a 48-72 hour time period

Needed assistance to stand and could not hold a pencil to write. Also numbness and tingling in hands and fingers. Face slightly swollen and red.  400 mg Ibuprofen was administered at  1530. Pushed fluids as soon as fever began. Cooling measures provided, cool shower, cold compress, change of clothes to light pajamas.  We contacted our Insurance 24 hour Nurse line at approximately 2100 when symptoms peaked. The RN on staff instructed us to seek immediate medical care.  We attempted to find an open Urgent Care unsuccessfully and tried to go to an ER but they were full. Fever began to come down around 2230, so we returned home. Continued with ibuprofen every six hours and cooling measures.

For instance, one day her entire palm of her hand, the next day her fingers, the next day the sole of her foot, a few days later it will be just one finger. It is very odd, but she has never had this issue. Also, she has never suffered from headaches until after this second shot. This has been going on for almost a month.

                                                My arm became incredibly sore within an hour. I woke up in the middle of the night aching like I had the flu. The body aches were so intense I couldn?t dress myself in the morning. All of my lymph nodes in my neck, ribs, and collar bones were incredibly swollen and hurt when touched. I rotated Tylenol and Advil with no relief. My fatigue was like no other. My headache wouldn?t go away either. 48 hours after the vaccine, I still had body aches and swollen lymph nodes in my neck to the point of pain when turning my neck.

Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

                                                I developed an initial fever of 101.2° and was completely bed bound, then that same initial day I began to develop extremely painful and unexplainable mouth sores and lesions. Some developed on my cheeks, some developed on my tongue and they were so painful that I could not eat, drink water, or even talk. I continued to spike fevers for an entire week without being able to control it. The pain was so unbearable and nothing was helping the pain go away, I am still unable to eat solid foods although I no longer have fevers. My throat also really hurt and my neck lymph nodes felt sore to the touch. The lesions in my mouth are beginning to heal but I am still bed bound and am trying to recover. Only thing I can bring myself to eat is chicken broth. I saw multiple doctors, not one of them was able to figure out the source of these awful lesions. They put me on acyclovir and cefuroximeacetil as an antibiotic.

I had fever and chills, muscle aches, joint pain,  headaches,  and nausea later that night as well. The next morning, my left eye was swollen, left side of tongue completely swollen, lips swollen, and left side of throat closed (anaphylaxis). I took prednisone, Benadryl, and Tylenol to relieve the symptoms, and the swelling around my left eye, tongue, throat, and lips went away. Throughout the day, more hives have developed around my body and face, including my right eye.  I am continuing to take Benadryl and Tylenol and finish doses of prednisone. The fever and chills, muscles aches, joint pains, hives, headache, and nausea are still present.

                                                On the night I received the COVID-19 vaccine, I had a fever that went up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. In the morning 24 hours after I had the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I felt a little better from the night&#39;s fever and ate instant ramen, oranges, acetaminophen, and a vitamin C tablet. This was at about 8:45 AM. A few minutes or a minute after I swallowed the acetaminophen and vitamin C, I got a severe allergic reaction that led to me going to the Emergency Room. I have eaten these things before and am not allergic to acetaminophen, vitamin C, or anything in the instant ramen. The reaction was first felt by a shortness of breath and I could barely breath. Then, hives started to form on my face and my lips and face became extremely swollen. I then ended up throwing up after my mom gave be a Benadryl pill and I drank another Benadryl after.  My face had become less swollen but it was still difficult to breath and hives started to form all over my body so we decided to rush to the Emergency Room. We got to the Emergency Room at about 9:30 AM and the hives on my body were worse. They were able to calm down the reaction by giving me more Benadryl through an IV and steroids. They knew I had the second dose of the vaccine so they did not give me anything that would suppress my immune system. Timewise, it could be the acetaminophen, but I have taken acetaminophen in the past many times before without a reaction.

On 2/11, my arm swelled up again and became red around the injection site and hard and warm to touch.

I did not consume any new food or use any new products. I took Benadryl for the itchiness. I had a telemedicine visit and I also had a Covid-19 test which was negative. I called health and also reported this adverse reaction. Moreover, I had no reaction to my second dose which was on 01-28-2021.

                                                I developed a very large, swollen lymph node under my left axillary.  I have never before had a swollen lymph node in either axillary regions of my arm. It was very painful, I could barely put my arm down because of the pressure of it pressing against the side of my body at rest. It has gotten better, there isn?t as much pain but it is still uncomfortable. The lymph node was/is palpable, and hurt upon touch and rest. The pain was an 7/10, but has now gone down to a 2/10. My arm is also still sore from the injection site, but it is not bad.

                                                1 week after recieving the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, I bumped my right arm about 2 inches below the injection site. Throughout the course of the day, my arm progressively became swollen and sore, to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it much or sleep on it. The next day it got progressively better on its own, and then I began taking an antibiotic prescribed by my doctor that helped it heal the rest of the way. I&#39;m not positive if the rest of the healing was on its own, or directly because of the antibiotic.

I could not life my arm past my chest because it was so swollen and sore. I stayed at home and skipped new year&#39;s, going back to sleep around 1030pm. It was not fun

                                                Pt reported that at about 7pm the day of her vaccine she developed a rash on her left arm/leg. It was itchy and so she took a Benadryl. She said her &#34;throat felt thicker&#34; but the Benadryl helped. She went to sleep and was fine. When she woke up the next morning on 1-6-2021 she reported the rash had spread. When she got to work and found me about 9:30 am to ask if that was normal I encouraged her to call her PCP and take a Benadryl. At that time she was having no difficulty breathing. She chose to call her PCP and not take a Benadryl as it makes her sleepy.  After she called her PCP she ended up leaving work. I found out later that her breathing had become labored and her neck/throat was starting to swell. Per her report, her PCP gave her epi and steroids, and R/X her an epi pen. She took her medicine and Benadryl around the clock and returned to work on 1-8-2021. When I spoke to her on that day she stated all of her symptoms had resolved, but her lymph nodes in her neck were still a little swollen.

Two days after I received my vaccine, my face and neck began to swell and I still had a severe headache and fatigue, which I treated with Tylenol and Benedryl. The Benedryl decreased the swelling in my face and neck and when I woke up on the third day, my headache had resolved. I felt fatigued on the third day, but by the evening, all of my symptoms had resolved.&#34;

The injection site was red, hot, throbbing and the size of a tennis ball. On 1/25 she was congested, had a headache and the injection site was red, hot, sore to the touch and sensitive. Most likely is an allergic reaction with facial swelling and local reaction, treated with Benadryl Motrin and add Pepcid or Zyrtec.  On 1/27 she was better with no fever x &gt; 24 hours and less fatigue. No body aches and no trouble breathing.

                                                Three majorly swollen lymph nodes in armpit of arm that received the vaccination. I noticed this reaction a couple of days after and contacted my PCP. She encouraged me to come in. She ordered an ultrasound of the nodes. Nodes showed no malignancy. Order to follow up in 3-6 months. Nodes are still currently present, but seem to be reducing in size. Second vaccination dose given 1/21/21 on left arm. No nodes in left armpit to date.

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

Then, on Feb 13th a rash started to reappear that was warm to the touch and itchy and burning. I applied cortisone but rash on injection site kept growing. On Feb 14th, I woke up and rash was a bit smaller but every two hours I would have a tingling sensation like when your foot falls asleep but it went up my shoulder and back area up to my neck and occurred every 2 hours. I then was advised to take claratin, add more cortisone, and take Benadryl as well. The itchiness stoped. My rash is still there but it?s very light compared to feb 13th.

Hives were symmetrical in nature and mirrored a ?covid rash? or urticaria. Swelling intensified even while on Benadryl. Only steroid began to help diminish redness after 24 hours on 80mg of prednisone.   Began 3/10, worsened exponentially until taking prednisone on 3/13. Now (3/14) healing but still experiencing itchiness and red bumps.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the event, I had throat swelling, chills, sweats, temperature of 102.5, headache, muscle soreness, dizziness, lightheadedness. Onset was over the course of about 1 hour. I had previously taken part in the double-blinded Astrazeneca in COVID-19 trials (meaning I did not know I was vaccinated) in November 2019, so the nurse told me that the response could really be from anything: partly due to some interaction between the vaccines, allergy, and/or already producing antibodies. I was unblinded and told I was given the Astrazeneca vaccine. Interestingly, I had none of these responses to just the Astrazeneca vaccines, just a bit of soreness after the first one. I have never had such a strong response, and I believe this is the highest my temperature has ever been, and my lymph nodes are still swollen. I am much better now; however, even last night and this morning, I was feeling unwell.

Along on those immediate symptoms I got the injection on my right arm and I experienced pain shooting up from my right arm into my neck and currently still have those pains from time to time when I move my right arm at an elevated angle. Day 4 of the vaccine I woke up one morning with swollen glands, congestion, swollen nasal glands, low grade fever of 100 degree F, very itchy irritated throat and hard to swallow, visited a clinic to see if I possibly had flu or strep but all my test results returned negative, also I had a covid test done and it was negative, I have never contracted covid 19 prior to vaccine and current day. Additionally, symptoms of congestion worsened and I am now experiencing some laryngitis due to the swelling of my lymph nodes, only sinus medication lessens the congestion to manage, I feel very fatigue, and experiencing some migraines.  Today only marks 1 weeks since the vaccine

Within the next hour, my jaw began to lock and my throat began to burn/tighten. Within this timespan, my body, especially my back began to ache as well as my chest feeling tight.  After three hours, I went to the on-campus clinic and they gave me 50mg of Benadryl.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine on 12/28/2020. I had no immediate reactions. By 6-7pm that night I started having severe pain in my right arm. The next morning 12/29/2020 I woke up with a migraine and still had severe pain in my arm. That night (12/29/2020) I began feeling aches and pains throughout my body and felt that into the next morning (12/30/2020). The evening of 12/30/2020 I noticed a dollar coin sized red spot on my arm that was warm to the touch and was slightly raised. (By this time my arm pain had decreased but was still present.) The red spot had grown slightly by 12/31/2020 but not much. Friday 01/01/2021 I hadn&#39;t payed much attention to the spot but it looked the same. The morning of 01/02/2021 I woke up and had noticed that the spot had taken over a large portion of the outer bicep on my right arm.

I had some minor swelling and soreness the first couple days after receiving the vaccine, but these symptoms both went away after a couple of days. A week later on 1/5, I noticed that the area where I had been injected was very swollen, red and itchy. It was localized to this year. There was some slight bruising around the top of where the swelling started. The area was not sore. There is still some redness and itching on 1/7 but the swelling has mostly gone down. I work in a community health center and had a PA I work with look at the reaction. I took some Benadryl as directed on 1/5 but have not treated the symptoms further.

                                                I developed a swollen supraclavicular lymph node above my left collarbone. It appeared just a few days after receiving the vaccine. No other side effects were noted aside from a sore arm and some itchiness around the injection site that lasted for 5 days after getting the vaccine. The lymph node is still swollen but is not worsening or painful. My sore arm and the itchiness have improved and are no longer an issue.

About 3-4 days later, a red, tender rash developed in the armpit of the same arm of injection. The rash is dry and burns to the touch. There is also a small patch of rash on the right armpit (not arm of injection). The rash on the left armpit completely covers the area.

My heart rate was elevated but that could have been related to my anxiety. I layered clothing on and finally managed to sleep. Upon waking up around 6 the next morning, I had a temperature of 102, a sore throat, throbbing headache, and was vomiting. My arm was so sore and swollen that I could hardly touch it. After rest, Tylenol, and fluids, I felt better around 8 that evening.

It went away and I had body aches later that day and the next day. Thursday I had a red spot on my arm below the injection site. The following week my whole upper arm  was swollen and I couldn&#39;t lift it , I went to the urgent care, they gave me antibiotics 500 mg 4x daily. The meds made me really sick and I quit taking it. and I started feeling better

Left after sitting for 20 minutes because I thought the &#34;anxiety&#34; would resolve best at home. Arrived home at 10:25 AM. My lips started itching, and then swelled along with my tongue. My throat felt tight and I tried to take an oral Benadryl. It got stuck in my throat and I was unable to swallow the pill. It was also difficult to swallow water. I arrived at the ED by 10:40 AM, where I was treated with IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol. I remained swollen all over, especially in my fingers, for the next 4 days. I gained 12 pounds, either from the reaction or the steroids. My airway did not fully close.

Stated lymph node became inflammed the day after injection, which subsequently was misinterpreted by a physician as a potential aneurysm (pulsating mass), resulting in unnecessary hopsitalization. With reference to the site injection, left deltoid became red, itchy, and hot initally  surrounding local site only. However, as days progressed, reddening spread radially to extend to a final diameter of approxiamtely 5 inches, which also required medical intervention. I was presecribed steroids and anitbiotics which alleviated said symptoms. The symtpoms went away 3 weeks after first dose injection. Physicians advised against taking second dose.

                                                I experienced general symptoms like fever, chills, aches (bad), neck lymph pain, fatigue, and nausea but the fever reached 102 degrees Fahrenheit which is slightly high.  A concerning side effect was that my resting HR was consistently above 105BPM from about 4:30AM-4PM the day after receiving the second dose. It reached as high as 125BPM without doing much movement at all to account for the high HR.

                                                Chest tightness starting ~4 hours post-injection accompanied by increased HR and mild pain/pressure on deep inspiration.  Occurred intermittently for the rest of the evening (1/25/21) and into the next day (1/26/21).  Mostly located along the left side of the sternum and at the base of the sternum.  In the following 9 days (to today (2/3/21))  symptoms persisted, occurring about once a day and gradually becoming more mild.   On day 4 post-injection (1/29/21) enlarged and tender lymph nodes were noticed in the left axillary region and supraclavicular region.  They grew in size and increased in tenderness to mild pain until 2/1/21 and have since been steadily decreasing in size and in tenderness although still noticeable in size and uncomfortable today. Symptoms did not prevent me from doing my normal exercise or school activities.  No treatment or medications were taken.

My arm hurt and swelled up for a few days with a large red bump. After a few days the bump went away. Im still having headaches, ive had diarrhea from day 1. I already struggle with my bowels and go to the bathroom way to much already and after given the vaccine those next days and still days continuing after I cant stay out of the bathroom. In 6 hours i had over 7 to 10 bowel movements and I hadnt ate a thing. As i thought I was getting better I woke uo the next day with my throat swelled up and i was all congested like a cold my body is very tired very sore a very light cough formed as well too my breathing is ok so far, my body on the inside feels like its on fire but im cold on the outside, one minute i was cold them im burning up. Its making me very overwhelmed and my nerves are all over the place.

The hives continued to spread outward until they covered about 25% of my arm 2-3 hours after the hives first appeared. This was the height of the pain/swelling/itchiness. The hives gradually moved upward along my arm and are currently an inch or two below my injection site (5 hours after the adverse effects began).

                                                Severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction; Passed out on the ground; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 22-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and passed out on the ground and had a severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.     On an unknown date, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    About 10 minutes after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, the patient passed out on the ground having a severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction.  Treatment for the event included two doses of epinephrine IM in addition to diphenhydramine, ondansetron, and steroids to prevent a rebound reaction. 911 was called and after epinephrine and diphenhydramine were administered, the patient was immediately transported to the hospital where she stayed for 6 more hours for observation, fluids, and further medications.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The events, passed out on the ground and severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction, were considered resolved; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Anaphylactic reaction is a listed event in CCDS.

Symptoms included redness and soreness at the site of injection and swollen lymph nodes in the armpit of the arm where the shot was injected. 12 hours after receiving the second dose I was shaking, nauseated, dizzy, sweating one minute and freezing the next, pain all over the body, my breathing slowed down and lastly there was a loud deafening ringing in my ears. These symptoms lasted a frightening 10 or so minutes leaving behind the bodily aches.

The patient also noted &#34;tingling&#34; in her right arm where she received the vaccine.  In addition, there was localized erythema at the injection site with about 5 cm in diameter.  I gave the patient 37 mg of Benadryl and the edema immediately was reduced in addition to the erythema resolved.  She had no more tingling.  I observed her for 30 minutes and all was fine with the patient.  I then checked on her 1 hour later and all was good.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking. The next day 1/6/21 I was still unwell, didn&#39;t go into work, felt weak and sore the whole day and noticed my underarm of the arm I received the shot was swollen and painful,. Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a 23-year-old, female consumer who was also a patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced anaphylactic reaction.   The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy to amoxicillin. Concomitant medications reported included gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate, and montelukast sodium.  On 04 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 05 Jan 2021, within 24 hours of vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction. Treatment for the event included Diphenhydramine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.  The outcome of the event, anaphylactic reaction, was considered resolved on 06 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 23 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. Event occurred apparently within 24 hrs. after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# 011L20A) vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient only had muffin and coffee that day early in am. Had some arm pain after shot no other reaction.  Did go home felt some nausea . Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                The day of the vaccine about 4 hours later, I started experiencing chest pain. It was not tightness or a heartburn feeling type of chest pain. I have asthma, and it is the type of chest pain I start feeling right before I get bronchitis, almost like breathing in mist and the irritation that comes from having a cough, but I had not had a cough that would have caused this sensation. The next day, I was extremely fatigued, had a headache, chills, started getting a cough, and was sent home early from work. The day after, Friday, I had a fever of 102 and was essentially bedridden. I started using my nebulizer and my dr called me in some prednisone. These symptoms continued through the weekend and began lifting that Sunday. However, on Monday, my lymph node under my ear started swelling on my left side (the same side as the shot), my ear became clogged, my sinuses on my left side had shooting pain every time I inhaled, and although I could breathe through my nostrils, they felt full and had immense pressure. Additionally my headache became worse and I began experiencing intense muscle pain right at the base of my skull on the left side near my occipital lymph node that was radiating into my head and making the headache and sinus pain worse. Now, 11 days after my first dose of the vaccine, I still have the ear pain, swollen lymph node under my ear/behind my jaw, sinus pain, muscle pain at the base of my skull, a headache, and extreme pressure in my head/sinus area that has not lifted. I started on an antibiotic Friday night (the 22nd) in hopes that this is a sinus and ear infection. Ibuprofen helps the headache slightly but makes the pressure in my head feel worse and makes the joints in my hands and forearms hurt and my fingers swell for some reason which has never happened before for me when taking ibuprofen.

                                                Received shot at 2:45pm. Sore/stiff arm started around 6pm. Went to sleep and woke up at 1:00am shaking with a fever and chills. Severe headache, throat sore with swollen glands, could barely walk/move or get out of bed. Also experienced nausea. Took tylenol around 1:00am and again at 5:00am.  Could not move from bed on Wednesday and had to call out of work Thursday with a bad headache, weakness, and overall body pain/discomfort. It is now Friday and I am still having very bad joint and muscle pain when I walk and move and still have a headache and fatigue/weakness.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

Day 4 (02/05/2021), I woke up around 7AM  with severe nausea and went back to sleep after having ginger ale; throughout the early afternoon I had mild lower back and knee pain, same throat and tonsil situation, mild headache, and diarrhea. I ended up drinking a lot of water and had a glass of emergen-c as well as taking two pepto bismol tablets. Less than an hour later, I threw up everything I?d consumed throughout the day (water, hot tea, and emergen-c, no food due to nausea). Tried eating plain white rice and drinking  beer that evening but I couldn?t keep it down. Day 5 (today, 02/06/2022), I woke up with only lower back pain, same tonsil/throat situation, headache, and a slightly higher fever- 100.2°F. So far no nausea.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I was in the shower at 5:45pm when my left arm began to itch.  I scratched my arm a few times.  Then, I looked at my arm and noticed that it was red.  There was a red area in the exact place where I received my Covid vaccination 8 days earlier.  There were also red scratch marks from where I itched the site.  A few minutes later, the itching had subsided, but the red mark was still visible.  I got out of the shower and took pictures of this mark.  The mark was on my left arm, where I received my Covid vaccination, and was in the shape of a defined square/oval.  At the time of this report, it has been approximately 3 hours since I first noticed this reaction.  At this time, the red mark is still visible, but the it does not itch.  The red mark on my arm looks similar to images of &#34;Covid Arm&#34; I have seen reported online.  Additionally, a few days (1-3 days) before this reaction, I had the feeling of discomfort in my left armpit.  From my personal experience, this feeling was consistent with the feeling of a swollen lymph node under my armpit area.  I felt this feeling for approximately 1 day total.  I thought nothing of the discomfort at the time.  The uncomfortable feeling in my armpit subsided approximately 1-2 days before the skin reaction on my arm occurred.  I do not know if these events are related, but they occurred in the same arm (left arm) where I received my Covid vaccination.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

Arm was very sore, hot to the touch, and swollen for nearly 3 weeks following the injection.  Second shot on 3/5 R arm, also developed a small red rash but was smaller and went away within a week. Within 24 hours of getting the vaccine, a high fever developed, fatigue, weakness, nausea, pain throughout my body, and migraines.

                                                The night of my vaccine, I had a 100 degree fever, body aches, and chills.  That was resolved by the next day.  On 3/29, I woke up with itchiness behind my right ear.  around 4:30pm on the same day, I had broken out into hives on my face and arms.  By 5:30 they had become itchy and had spread to my neck and chest area.  I had also developed swelling around my eyes, above and below them.  I woke up at 1:30am on 3/30 with itching and burning and more swelling around my eyes.  At 7:30am on 3/30,  my eyes were almost swollen shut and I sought medical attention.  I had itching and burning on my entire body, swollen eyes, full body aches, and joint pain.  I was prescribed steroids and began that course around 1:30pm.  I was also prescribed two epi pens.  Around 6:30pm that night, I had a 100.7 degree fever.  It dropped without the use of a fever reducer within the next two hours. The swelling reduced around my face by 8pm.  This morning, I had almost no swelling, but still a full body rash.  I am treating it with benadryl, zyrtec and maximum strength pepcid, steroids, and calamine lotion.

                                                On the morning of 1/8/2021 (exactly 6 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine), I woke up with large hives concentrated mostly on my upper body (face, neck, chest, stomach). I tried taking various antihistamines (excluding Benadryl, which would later prove effective) to combat the hives, but they were largely ineffective. The hives shifted throughout the day, starting in my upper body and working their way down to my lower extremities. The next day, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I woke up with worse hives (now all over my body, mostly concentrated on my stomach, hips, and legs) and angioedema in my face. At this point, I went to the hospital and received a course of IV fluids/steroids/Benadryl/anti-nausea medication and all symptoms subsisted. Symptoms returned a few hours after discharge, where I continued an oral regimen of the aforementioned medications. The next day, 8 days after the initial dose, my symptoms were equally severe and coupled with gastrointestinal distress, feverishness (likely due to dehydration from the Benadryl) and nausea. This morning (1/11/2021), 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my hives have largely subsisted. In summation, starting 6 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced 3 full days and nights of severe hives and swelling.

No history of anaphylaxis. She received vaccine at 5:42. Felt lightheaded and dizzy about 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine. She noted chest tightness and tachycardia symptoms. We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.  Suspect anaphalxis reaction given rapid decline in status while talking with her. epic pen at bedside immediately and then due to increasing heart rate and complaints of chest discomfort gave her epipen times one. Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

                                                ~24 hours after the vaccine, I got a mild rash on my face. This rash went away in about 12 hours. The rash was itchy and hot, but didn&#39;t last long. After this I noticed I would get stomach pain intermittently. This has not gone away yet (today&#39;s date is 1/28/20). The stomach pain has been intermittent, not related to certain foods, and hurts sometimes when I don&#39;t even eat. It has progressed into getting severely bloated every time I eat any foods. The bloating lasts ~1-2 hours after consumption. No matter how big or small the meal or snack is, or what the food is, it results in me being bloated.

                                                Initial adverse event occurred 25 minutes after injection. Sudden confusion, burning heat and hives and burning red rash spreading from injection site, up neck and throat and down arm to hand. 5 days after the injection, a severe allergic reaction occurred where my entire body broke into hives and a red burning rash, again starting at the injection site. Throat tightness, itchiness in scalp and groin, and difficulty concentrating (all my usual symptoms of anaphylaxis) occurred. Advised by health care provider to take Benadryl immediately and to have epi-pens on hand. Loratadine was prescribed.

Symptoms began 48 hours after the injection of the second dose.  There has also been nerve problems in the left arm starting on 1/27, about 22 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine taken on 1/5, in the left arm. Loss of motor function and clawing of the fourth and fifth finger resulted in the left hand. As of 2/1 motor function returned, however forth and fifth fingers are still not able to enforce resistance against external pressure. The lot number of the first dose is #025J20-2A

I had a burning sensation and lypmhadenopathy in the armpit of my injection arm, significant pain at injection site, with slight tingling and numbness radiating down to the hand of my injection arm as well. I took 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours for 24 hours, which provided minimal symptom relief. All symtpoms were relived within 72 hours of receiving the vaccine.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 3pm 1/13/21. I was fine for the 30 minutes after, not even sore at the injection site.  Around 6pm, my muscles started aching, but not painful enough to be concerned.  At 3am 1/14/21, I woke up in pain in every muscle. Enough to wake me, but not terrible.  At 7am, I noticed a pinpoint pain in my armpit, and my muscles still ached.  At 9:30am, I took ibuprofen to attempt to curb the pain a bit.  Around 10am, it got so painful I was limping, and having trouble bending down or reaching above shoulder height.  At 11:30am, I noticed the pinpoint pain in my armpit had gotten worse, and there is a hard, approximately quarter-sized round lump in this spot. Very painful.  At 2:30, I went to move my shirt sleeve and the pain at the injection site was so intense I screamed when I touched it.  This pain continued until 1/16/21 when I woke up feeling entirely normal.  Since 1/16/2021, my hands have been randomly stiffening, either completely stretched out and dropping anything in them, or closing tight enough to leave fingernail marks on my palms. I will also reach to grab things and my hands will sometimes bend into odd shapes, instead of what I intended for them to do. This began at 1-2 times a day, and is becoming more often. It is now up to 2-4 times daily.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

My arm was so sore and I couldn&#39;t move it higher than my hip for two days. I was lethargic for two days and slept for a total of 40 hours over the course of the two days following injection. I also had a headache for about a week after the injection.

                                                The first vaccine I only had mild arm pain which went away after a few days, exactly 7 days later I had a delayed localized reaction (extreme swelling size of a golf ball, redness, itching, hot to the touch). I spoke with my primary and he recommended to still get the second vaccine. The second vaccine the swelling came on almost immediately (about 2 hours after). It has now been two days since I have had the shot and my arm is now double the size of my muscle. (I am petite, 5?3 and 107 lbs) so my arms are tiny. My arm is red, hot to the touch, swollen and itchy. I have had a fever of 102.8, the lowest I have gotten it down is 101.2 with around the clock Tylenol. Other side effects: vomiting, chills, high fever, EXTREME joint pain. I?m concerned about the localized reaction (I would call it localized allergic reaction). I have photos I?m not sure if I can send them.

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

On 03/07/21, exactly 10 days post my vaccine I developed hives/welts on both hands, both elbows , both knees, and toes  that were elevated. I also developed some minor swelling but no fever, no pain just los of itchiness. I was given a vaccine of Medrol to calm down the sxs and seem to be doing okay.

Then the following day I felt better but had a annoying, constant headache all day. Then when showering I found a tender lump in my right armpit (same side as my vaccine). I?m pretty sure this is a swollen lymph node, and thought I should report it since I don?t have a spleen and I developed it pretty soon after the vaccine.

Then on saturday night after dinner and dessert (all things I&#39;ve eaten recently so nothing new) I began swelling in my lips and under my right eye. I took 6 doses of off-brand benadryl and it would only decrease the swelling by very small increments. My breathing was alright, but to this day as of 03/22/2021 my lips are still slightly puffy.

                                                That evening my arm swelled up and became very painful - not as much as the first vaccine. I had a hard time sleeping - nausea and headache throughout the  night. 4/3 - extremely tired; felt like I couldn&#39;t get enough air (shortness of breath) body aches and muscles aches - over all lethargic. 4/4 - I was dizzy, short of breath . Those two symptoms lasted along with fatigue - which lasted for two days. I almost passed out that day - everything went black and I had to be assisted to the couch to recover from that.  I used Tylenol for my symptoms when needed.   I still have ongoing headaches - three weeks ago (about a week after I got the vaccine) - I noticed I was having ongoing headaches and I still have these.  Pregnancy - 2nd pregnancy; 1st one was full term. Date of delivery expected - September 9, 2021.

Later in the day I took my temperature and had a fever of 101, my fever later broke after taking Tylenol and NyQuil. The next day, Saturday, my lymph node in the left armpit was so swollen I could not wear a shirt. My nausea continued but I no longer had a fever. My lymph node continued to be swollen until Monday. On Monday I woke up with a rash on the left side of my chest, small red dots and this resolved by the end of the day.

She states these symptoms have somewhat improved, though she has been experiencing increasing nausea since yesterday and continues to feel that way. She states that she does not believe she is pregnant, she has an IUD. She also noticed some body aches yesterday, continuing this morning, but they seem to be improving. They do improve greatly with ibuprofen at home.

It is not painful or itchy, just warm to the touch. Over night, the area got less red and less warm but the swollen area had gotten larger.

On 1/14, I noticed the left supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged, no pain with palpitation. On 1/15 the underside of my left arm was itchy but no visible rash. On 1/16 the arm was still itchy and the lymph node was more enlarged. No neck or axillary nodes were enlarged. On 1/17 in the morning I woke up with a large red rash on my left deltoid. It was not itchy, but as the day went on was more red, raised, and warm. The node in my neck was causing some neck discomfort. I presented to Urgent Care and was treated for a local reaction. I was given a steroid cream to use on my arm and was told to take an OTC antihistamine. I have been using the cream for 2 days and so far the rash is resolving but is still visible. The node has not yet decreased in size.

Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

                                                My face became numb and tingly as if I was at the dentist and got a shot to numb my gums and it was wearing off . My whole face felt this way. For at least about 1-2 hours.   Additionally at about 9:00pm to the next morning 1/20/21 I began to get pain in my armpit I examined using my fingers and felt it sesintive to touch and consulted with a physician who said my lymph nodes must be swollen as a response.

                                                I started to notice on Tuesday, January 19th, that there was a red bump on my arm. It looked more like a mosquito bite to me and was not bigger than a quarter. It didn?t feel itchy but I thought nothing of it. I noticed when I got home it was twice as big but I still felt no pain. It appeared that my arm was also swollen. The following day on Wednesday, it has grown in size again covering my arm, maybe the size of four quarters. Throughout the day it felt a bit hot, especially when I touched it. It did not feel itchy and I didn?t feel any pain. I felt a bit tired this day so I?m not sure if it was because of it. The redness has gone down today (Friday, January 22nd) however the mark is still big and in the shape of a square now. The outer part of the mark is more red and raised up, like it has a red border.

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

On Thursday 1/14 I noticed an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node on the left side. On Friday 1/15 I had some itching on my arm but no visible rash. On Sunday 1/17 there was a large visible rash localized to my left deltoid. The lymph node was causing some neck discomfort as well. I presented to the Urgent Care as was given steroid cream to apply and I have also been instructed to take an OTC antihistamine.

I was hit with intense nausea and vomiting that has been persistent since the night of 3 FEB. I can?t keep much down. 4 Feb I had a fever of 102.3 starting around 4am, I brought it down with a 600 Mg dose of Ibuprofen but it came back off and on throughout the day alongside sweats and chills. All of my lymph nodes were swollen and my entire body hurt. I was unable to sleep last night 4feb/5feb due to muscle pain.  As of today I feel a little better and am without a fever, but I am still incredibly nauseous and have developed a sore throat.

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

                                                I woke up around 4AM with fever, cold chills, nausea, and body aches. I had the body aches and chills for two days and then I was okay. My arm was very swollen, red, and painful. I also had a reaction to my first vaccine lot #011J20A where 8 days after the dose my arm had a red rash, very swollen, hot to the touch, and painful. This reaction took about 5 days to go away.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Three days following the injection I had most of the symptoms. The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

At this time on 2/28/2021, I still have the raised red mark on my area but it has lightened and it is still itching. My lymph nodes are still swollen and a headache is still present as well as fatigue but the sore throat has mostly resolved.

                                                pt stated that 10 minutes after receiving the covid vax her throat started closing so she went to the ER.  She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

                                                My arm started hurting very bad after about 2-3 hours. At the 12 hour mark from my vaccine (11:30PM), I started to have chills, a fever, and feel nauseous. Around 1 AM I started to vomit and this occurred for about 15 minutes, and then repeated again about an hour later. By the morning of the day after I was no longer vomiting or had chills but still had a fever. The most prominent symptoms on the day after my vaccine were extreme body aches and horrible joint pain. My hands and feet felt swollen and stiff. I had terrible pains and aches in my whole entire body. I was also very tired and still had a low grade fever. On the second day after the vaccine I had bad chest and neck pain and started to have a mild cough. By the third day after the vaccine, the chest pain was gone but still had bad neck pain and a headache that radiated through my skull.

I also had severely painful swollen axillary lymph nodes on the same side that I received my injection. I was not able to work or do any of my daily activities for almost three days. Then on day 7 after receiving my first vaccine dose, I developed a itchy, painful, red rash and hives surrounding the injection site (about a two to three inch radius around the injection site. I also got hives and red itchy painful skin on my face. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed prednisone and a week of pepside and zyrtec. After a week I stopped taking the allergy meds and then the hives came back, so I kept taking the allergy meds until my second vaccine dose.

                                                16 days post vaccination I broke out into truck hives with occasional spot of arms and legs. Hives stayed for 4 days start to finish and were unaffected by benedryl and other antihistamine drugs. Cortisone creams also had no effect. Hives were raised but not red and did not bother me other than visually.

                                                Beginning 3/3/21 my left arm began to hurt and my fingers became numb (as if my arm was asleep).  I noticed swelling in my arm and began taking Ibuprofen.  Sometimes my arm would begin to &#34;wake up&#34; and my whole are would tingle. On 3/7/2021 I developed a red area around the injection site and my arm swelling was more pronounced.  My arm also feels hot somtimes.    I have continued to take Ibuprofen and place ice on my arm in the evening.  I continue to have the swelling, hot arm, red patch, and pain in my arm as of today.  The &#34;numb&#34; feeling is something that comes and goes.

(I had Covid-19 back in November of 2020)   Around 8:00 pm I had developed some head congestion and swollen lymph nodes along with some throat pain and sinus congestion - again feeling very similar to Covid-19 symptoms.   Around 10:00 pm as I was heading to bed the symptoms became  a lot worse, I had pretty intense body aches and started to experience chills as well as a slight fever (around 99.5 in F). At this time the symptoms felt similar to how I had felt during the worst of my previous Covid-19 symptoms, very weak and achy, headache was very bad, and felt very uncomfortable overall.   Around 2:00 am on March 13 I woke up with a fever of 101.8. The previous symptoms had also gotten worse, I was having a hard time getting out of bed because things were very uncomfortable, I drank a lot of water and took some ibuprofen to combat the fever, about an hour after this the fever had come down to about 99.9 and I was able to fall asleep, but before taking the medication I couldn&#39;t have fallen asleep because of the discomfort of the aches, chills, and fever.   Throughout the following day I was unable to complete many of my day to day activities without taking a daytime cold and flu medication. With the medication I still felt sick but was able to walk around and complete some simple household chores, this carried through into the evening, when the medication wore off the chills and aches and headache were much worse and I still had a fever around 99-100. That night I was able to sleep with the cold and flu medication taken right before bed.  Upon waking up the next morning (March 14) I still had some congestion, headache, and general discomfort but the worst of the aches were gone and I no longer had a fever, these symptoms continued to diminish throughout the day.   On March 15 and March 16th I have had a slight lingering congestion headache, this also feels really similar to the lingering headache I had upon recovering from Covid-19. It is not debilitating and is continuing to improve. Otherwise I am feeling healthy again and have been able to complete my usual activities and even exercise.   Overall the symptoms felt like a couple days of having Covid-19 again, but recovery was much faster, and it was definitely worth receiving that first dose of the vaccine and getting started with the process of doing my part to reduce community spread.

Later that same day around 9:00pm I noticed a uncolored 2 1/2 inch in diameter welt on my arm and it was very very itchy. I took Benadryl and went to bed. March 19, 2021 I woke up and the swelling went down a little but now the area is very red. Slightly itchy.

                                                I felt arm pain in my left arm Around 4:00 pm, I started reaching for my face but I could not feel my face - it felt numb and tingly. That went on for two hours. There was no other droopiness juts facial numbness. My arm pain lasted for a good three weeks. It caused the lymph nodes under my armpit to swell. The pain went from my axilla Lymph nodes down to my left breast.  I got a pinkish, reddish, itchy rash at the spot on the injection about a week later. I don&#39;t recall the date for the doctor visits - one telehealth and one in person. They wanted me to use Primrose oil to massage the oil. They told me to keep an eye on it. I still continue to get the pain under my arm pit from time to time. I have still been seeing physician about that.

                                                Day of vaccine I felt perfectly fine. The next day i woke up with a swollen arm and very painful every time i loved it. Injection site was hot to the touch and it felt like a knot was under my skin. around 10:00am I began to feel feverish all over my body. I began to have the chills and began to feel tired. My body was achy as well and a headache developed. I slept from about 12:30PM to 6:30 PM and took acetaminophen at that time. Feverish feeling and chills broke after pill got into my system. Arm is still in major pain.

I (the pharmacist) administered an EpiPen once, then 50mg diphenhydramine IM, and called 911. Patient was evaluated by EMS and brought to the hospital for observation.

After departing about 25-30 minutes after vaccination the patient noticed some moderate/severe throat closure, and went to an ER for treatment, and was given an EPI-pen, which seemed to aid the patient. They were discharged about 1-2 hours later   The pharmacy was contacted about an hour or so after vaccination.  The patient is well, with some minor swelling remaining.

Laying on that affected side is where it hurt. I woke up - vomited twice - nauseous; did visit through insurance on Saturday, the 23rd  - at 8:30 am and Dr. prescribed Zofran for the nausea. Other symptoms: fatigue, headache and fever. Highest temp was 102.9. I only give myself Tylenol when my temperature when my temp is over 102. I took Ibuprofen as needed for the fever - helped the fever to go down. Mid Sunday, the lymph node started - on the left side of my  neck and also under the armpit of that side. It was a quarter coin size of swelling under the armpit. For that I was drinking water and putting warm compress on the affected areas. The first symptoms lasted 3 days (resolved Monday). The lymph node swelling resolved Tuesday.
