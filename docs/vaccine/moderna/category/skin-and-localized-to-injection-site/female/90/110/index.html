                                                Caretaker at Facility contacted me to tell me that this morning, patients left arm is red and raised all the way to the elbow and very painful. Patient gets scheduled ibuprofen for arthritis which is helping.  She has had no other problems with other vaccinations including flu shot Fall 2020. Denies SOB, swollen tongue or throat, or rash/red areas anywhere else on body. Wondering if getting vaccine 3-1/2 months after getting COVID may be reason she is reacting. Caretaker anticipates she will recover just fine but is concerned about giving 2nd shot of series.

After about three days, the patient developed (not sure of the technical term), large blood blotches beneath the skin. On both arms and on her back. The itching has subsided. Five days later, the blood blotches are still there but seem to be slowly improving.

She tried cortisone cream yesterday for the itching, but it did not help.  This morning when she woke up the rash had spread and was all the way up her arm.  She was putting cold compresses on it as well.  She went to the UC at 1:00 this afternoon, who ordered an antibiotic and told her that there seemed to be an infection at the site of the needle.   Told her not to use the cortisone cream, to use the cold packs.

She only had mild itching at the injection site. Out of concern due to my mother&#39;s age I called her physician to report this on Day 3. Dr. advised her to take Zyrtec during day and Benadryl at night for itching as needed but did not see my mother. My mother has not taken these meds. She did not take any Zyrtec or Benadryl because she has no itching, just this awful looking rash that doesn&#39;t hurt or itch.  Occasionally she gets a prickle of an itch but not much.  She takes Tylenol for any aches of arthritis, too. I have pictures of each day of this if it is helpful to you. Today is Day 7 and her leg tops are beginning to look a little better but the backs of the legs and arms are now affected with the large almost melted rash into several big areas of red.  She also has minimal spots on her buttocks but nothing like legs and arms. Interesting it is only in her extremities (we are so glad!!) and we are hoping it will resolve completely.  She wanted you to know her reaction to help you.  Due to her age, I will be taking her calls for her.

                                                Patient has a large (golf ball sized) welt on back side of left arm that she noticed a few days after vaccine. She had a friend circle the welt and as of today (2/6/21) it has not grown. It is not red, not painful to touch, but firm. I am not sure that it is from the vaccine since it is closer to the back side of the arm and not in the deltoid muscle, though it did occur around the same time. Patient notified her doctor and was advised to ice the lump which provided no help. I advised her to actually be seen by her doctor to have it assessed. She will call to schedule an appointment.

Face swollen to almost eye shut by Mar 1, very itchy and weepy. Rash also visible on neck and front of torso.               Visited doctors office on Mar 1 at 1:00pm. Received prescription for Prednizone 20mg, to be taken over 10 days.  Seems to be working, swelling is down and not as severely itching. Still very visable and dry crust forming on face.

                                                Client was vaccinated in the triceps area of the arm instead of the deltoid. The vaccinator stated that the client was very frail and he did not feel there was enough muscle mass in the deltoid to administer the vaccine there. He opted to give the vaccine in the triceps instead.   Vaccinator has been counseled on this and explained that a better muscle to use would have been the anterolateral thigh. Per information from CDC, this dose does not need to be repeated. District Nurse Manager followed up on client today (3/26/2021), and client only complains of soreness in arm at site of injection.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Dementia.   In February 2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. In February 2021, received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced DEMENTIA ALZHEIMER&#39;S TYPE (acute Alzheimers) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), DEMENTIA (had mild dementia but towards the end it seemed to have exacerbated) (seriousness criterion medically significant), HYPOTENSION (blood pressure became very low) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CELLULITIS (experienced cellulitis in her legs) (seriousness criterion medically significant), COVID-19 (Diagnosed with COVID a week later) and MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (she couldn&#39;t even remember anybody). The patient died on an unknown date. The reported cause of death was death was acute alzheimers. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the time of death, DEMENTIA (had mild dementia but towards the end it seemed to have exacerbated), CELLULITIS (experienced cellulitis in her legs), COVID-19 (Diagnosed with COVID a week later) and MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (she couldn&#39;t even remember anybody) outcome was unknown and HYPOTENSION (blood pressure became very low) had resolved.            Treatment included unspecified pressors. No concomitant medications were reported. Patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in FEB-2021. Caller did not know the exact dates of administration of the two doses. Patient was then diagnosed with COVID a week later. Patient did not have much of a reaction to the 1st dose or any symptoms from COVID. She then received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in middle of FEB-2021, per the caller. In the end of APR-2021 or beginning of MAY-2021, patient experienced cellulitis in her legs. Her blood pressure became very low and she was hospitalized for treatment. She was put on pressors. She recovered from it and was sent back to her assisted living facility. However, on 25-MAY-2021, she passed away at the assisted living due to acute Alzheimers. Patient had mild dementia but towards the end it seemed to have exacerbated, where she couldn&#39;t even remember anybody. Her diagnosis at the time of death was acute Alzheimers.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-034532 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: This is a 91-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna) (batch unknown) who experienced exacerbation of her DEMENTIA, ALZHEIMER&#39;S DEMENTIA, HYPOTENSION and CELLULITIS after her second dose of vaccine, leading to her death from ACUTE ALZHEIMERS.  Advanced senior age also could be attributed to the development of the events. It is unlikely, that the events are related to the vaccine based on long standing illness of DEMENTIA. . Very limited information has been reported at this time. Further information is expected.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: death was acute Alzheimers

                                                Pacemaker Surgery; patient did end up missing the date of her second vaccination and has not received it; feel itchy; feeling very funny and real strange; This spontaneous case was reported by a non-health professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of CARDIAC PACEMAKER INSERTION (Pacemaker Surgery) in a 93-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 013M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included RIVAROXABAN (XARELTO), VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID] and VITAMIN D NOS for an unknown indication.    On 04-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 04-Feb-2021, the patient experienced PRURITUS (feel itchy) and FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling very funny and real strange). On an unknown date, the patient experienced CARDIAC PACEMAKER INSERTION (Pacemaker Surgery) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and INCOMPLETE COURSE OF VACCINATION (patient did end up missing the date of her second vaccination and has not received it). At the time of the report, CARDIAC PACEMAKER INSERTION (Pacemaker Surgery), PRURITUS (feel itchy) and FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling very funny and real strange) outcome was unknown and INCOMPLETE COURSE OF VACCINATION (patient did end up missing the date of her second vaccination and has not received it) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 04-Feb-2021, Electrocardiogram: normal (normal) heart was operating properly.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Patient was taking unspecified blood pressure medication concomitantly.  Following the administration while the patient was in the clinic, she began to feel itchy, very funny and real strange. At this time the EMS on site were concerned and preformed an electrocardiogram (EKG) on the patient to make sure that the heart was operating properly. It was deemed that it was and the patient was then sent home. After that time no other side effects were present but the patient did eventually have to go into the hospital for a Pacemaker Surgery that was believed to be unrelated. The date of this surgery could not be remembered at the time of the call.  No treatment information was provided.

This began the next day after the vaccination and has persisted for the past six days. I have applied Hydrocortisone creme 1% two or three times every day  and that helps relieve the itch, but the swelling and redness continues.

                                                Patient was awakened by itchiness on left arm from elbow to wrist. Increased in severity to feeling as though on fire and being bitten by a thousand mosquitoes. Spread to other arm, both becoming bright red and blotchy. Some areas became raised. The itchy red began to creep up to injection site. Next day, February 21, legs began to ache, swell, and itch. Developed bright red, splotchy hives similar to arms spreading from knees to ankles before creeping up thighs. Large, hard, itchy area behind both ankles, and navel also became inflamed and itchy. Today (March 1) arms and legs are still red, though it has faded in some areas, and the itchiness is persistent but has subsided.

That reaction slowly went down and it&#39;s just above her elbow, she&#39;s 95 and it is kind of filled up with a hard mass in that area.  Her arm looks like a sunburn with two different shades of skin, on the back side of her arm where it is red.   She still has it on her arms today, 2/11/21.  She has not taken anything for it or put anything on it.  Her doctor told her to call us to see what we said she should do.  There is no pain, but it just looks bad and she is concerned.
