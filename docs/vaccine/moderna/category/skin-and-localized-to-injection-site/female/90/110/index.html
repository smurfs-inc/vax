                                                Caretaker at Facility contacted me to tell me that this morning, patients left arm is red and raised all the way to the elbow and very painful. Patient gets scheduled ibuprofen for arthritis which is helping.  She has had no other problems with other vaccinations including flu shot Fall 2020. Denies SOB, swollen tongue or throat, or rash/red areas anywhere else on body. Wondering if getting vaccine 3-1/2 months after getting COVID may be reason she is reacting. Caretaker anticipates she will recover just fine but is concerned about giving 2nd shot of series.

                                                Injection arm (left) was itchy when we left facility. But other than that, no pain, no feelings of illness. So, didn&#39;t think much of it. After about three days, the patient developed (not sure of the technical term), large blood blotches beneath the skin. On both arms and on her back. The itching has subsided. Five days later, the blood blotches are still there but seem to be slowly improving.

                                                Starting the afternoon of 1/14/21 patient stated the injection site started to feel itchy. When she looked in the mirror, there was an area of bright pink surrounding injection site. She reports the site felt swollen and she could not tell if it was warmer than her other shoulder. Early on the morning of 1/15/21, patient reports the area around injection site was bright pink and remained swollen. At this time it is less itchy, but remains lightly itchy intermittently. At 9am on 1/15/21, RN visited patient and was informed of her reaction. RN observed her L upper arm and she has an oval-shaped light pink area with injection site at the center. Oval measures 8.8 cm x 6.1 cm. The site is warm, slightly swollen, and feels indurated from the swelling. Patient is afebrile at 97.4 orally. Patient reports the light pink coloring at this time is less bright than it was earlier in the morning. Report is being made at 10 am 1/15 so outcome of reaction unknown at this time.
