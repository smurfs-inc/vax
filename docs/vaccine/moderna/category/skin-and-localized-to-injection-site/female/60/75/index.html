                                                Monday, January 4 in the evening I became very fatigued, to the point where I couldn&#39;t stay awake.  When I woke up a few hours later, I noticed that I had a very bad headache and all-over body aches, and I felt like I had the flu.  Weak, nauseous and extremely tired.  I went to bed and slept through the night, when my alarm woke me at 7:00 am on Tuesday, January 5, I got up to use the bathroom and felt all the same symptoms from the night before, only worse.  I noticed that I had a rash on my left arm below the injection site.  I called in sick and went back to bed.  I slept from approximately 7:30 to 2:00 pm on January 5.  I felt a little better upon awakening, but had a very bad headache and no appetite.  The other body aches seemed better.

The pain is lateral upper right arm and descends inferiorly toward the elbow. No redness or swelling at the site.  I&#39;m having great difficulty with sleep because of the pain.  The pain is aggravated by  motion.  The pain is helped somewhat with ibuprofen 200 mg every 6-8 hours.

Monday morning, 1/4/21, after my shower I noticed the itching again and an erythematous area, about 7 x 9cm, where I had received the injection.  Today the area is much larger, 15 x 20cm, less red and still itchy. A localized allergic reaction 10 days after the vaccine was received seems unusual to me.

                                                On day 8 following vaccine, I noticed that the site of injection was red and raised.  It had not been up t then.  Red, raised area was about 2&#34; x 3&#34;.  No pain, no other symptoms.  I massaged area in  a hot shower.  Also, had a headache in the middle of the night same date that was 5/10 pain and required 2 extra strength Tylenol-not normal for me.  I called my PCP.  She offered to see me, but did not require it. I chose not to be seen; I just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t overlooking something.

                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

Around 1115 she was still dizzy, stated she didn?t have much to drink or eat, so we brought her water and a snack.  No hx of diabetes. 1120 she looked flushed, and now had tingling in her left arm.  Took her BP 140/70, HR 70,  temp on her forehead 97.1.   1130 she continued to have a strange feeling in her arm from her shot site to her left hand, and up her neck.

She began to exercise her left arm, and began to feel better. She left with her family at approximately 1:00, still a little dizzy, no longer flushed with less discomfort.  We called her at 7;15 pm and she reported that symptoms had resolved.  Took Zyrtec. Extended observation and sent home.

                                                48 hours after vaccination, noticed small red spots on and around right axillary. Non-itchy,not raised,not petechiae, not hive like. Some areas are blotchy, and red, as though there are groups of spots. By next morning (10 hours later), the rash had spread from my neck to my groin,including my arms, but not my lower extremities. Group A strep test was negative, to rule out Scarlatina-I do not have a sore throat. Some areas have a slight burning sensation where my clothes may be rubbing.

Now at day 12 I still have a faint rash with itching.  I also had a fever (100.1) and body aches for the first 2 days. Then later began coughing and still have the cough. I am not sure if the cough is related to the vaccine or if it may be a virus that I may have picked up. I have been treating the symptoms using OTC cough syrup, Tesslon Pearls and albuterol inhaler if I get wheezy.

The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

She hadn&#39;t changed any laundry detergent or soap recently, so attributed it to receiving vaccine the day prior.  She did not want to take any diphenhydramine as she had to work that day, so she used hydrocortisone cream on the rash which subsided and decreased itching within a few hours.  The rash subsequently resolved that day.  No other symptoms reported, vital signs stable.

Looked in the mirror 2 hours after and my neck was all red, only 2 hives but had a long red Mark (looked like a strangulation mark).

These vesicle/bites were extremely itchy at night as in Scabies type exposure. 1 tube of Permethrin cream applied over course of several days. Proceeded to MD on 1/15/21 who ruled out scabies, but is suspicious this is possibly related to vaccine. 1 IM inj of Kenalog 40 and Triamcinolone cream for the face was the treatment.

                                                8 days after injection, right arm started to get red, swollen and hot at injection site.  This spread around upper arm area through the day.  Overnight I experienced body aches and chills.  Those flu like symptoms lasted just under 24 hours.  The arm was still swollen and red and hot for the next two days.  All those symptoms decreased.  The swelling and hotness disappeared completely.  The arm is still red in some areas and it is itchy sometimes.  Today one week after the delayed reaction, my arm still has red areas and its very itchy today.

Then i was ok for 2 days then my arm started to hurt and i got a runny nose and a mild headache and fatigue. My nose ran so much i did not work the next day. I received a negative covid PCR test. then 1 day later my left arm started to itch, turn red and swell. It has continued through today (the swelling is about 4 inches by 3 inches, over my left deltoid). i just took Benadryl. i am now on day 9 post vaccination.

                                                Starting on Day 9 post injection I awoke with severe flu like symptoms:  severe headache, body aches, joint aches, fatigue, inability to get out of bed. Once I did get up I noted a severe red rash covering chest and extending up anterior neck (looked like a radiation burn). Symptoms lasted all day and made work or ADLs impossible. Felt about 75% better next day then symptoms returned the following day. Rash began peeling and appeared to look like a 2nd degree burn. Symptoms resolved by Day 4.

Then on day 7 the injection site became itchy under the skin, slight soreness. Day 8 more itchy under the skin, warm to touch, redness an soreness in the area not just at the injection site. Day 9 hive like rash, itchy under the skin, red  and soreness, warm to touch. I took a benadryl 25mg it took out the swelling in the hive like rash.  Thats my story. Now I&#39;m very concern do I get my Second Vaccine on February 9,2021. Please advise me  on what I should do. I&#39;m having a Tela-Med appointment with my primary on  Friday Jan.22

                                                This last weekend, 01/16/2021 I woke to a sore arm below the injection site in my left arm. As the day went on, the area started getting hot and itchy, and has lasted through today. It is not as red, or sore, but still is itchy. I have been applying Cortizone-10 to the area and has helped, and also took an allergy pill. The area affected is the muscle and skin in the bicep area.

I felt dizzy and out of it. This lasted for 2-3 hours. The next day it was much better but I still feel that problem a little bit. Secondly, I felt tingling in my head, arms and legs since then, slowly waning.

                                                I originally reported this as an allergic reaction. However, the following day upon closer observation it began to look more like an infection under my skin. I am mediately applied Neosporin over the entire area and it began to bleed from a small scabbed area under the injection mark. After bleeding for a minute or two it turned from dark red to light pink and the swelling went down.

                                                Within a few minutes of injection had tingling sensation in tongue, followed by a couple days of increased stomach gas, tons of burping, some reflux, took Prevacid. Tongue seemed to affected during the first several days, especially along the sides, red. Didn&#39;t get concerned at first.  The common sore arm, cleared up within a few days. On about day 10 noticed large area on arm where injection given, warm red area about 4 inches by 3 inches, itchy, resolved on own by day 14 or 15.  The next week (third week) mouth seemed to be getting more sore, swallowing harder, took prevacid. Today, day 27, mouth is sore, especially noticeable along sides where there are circle looking ulcerations where surface tissue seems to be missing. Very discouraged. Doubt I feel able to receive second dose which has been postponed, by myself, until day 30. Seeing primary doctor on day 30.

                                                I had minimal symptoms after my first dose, some injection site pain, very mild, for a day or two which then completely resolved.  At day 9 post injection, my arm at the injection site did become itchy and when I looked at the area, there was about a 2-1/2 circle of mild redness around the injection site.  This persisted for about 24 hours along with the mild itching and mild soreness.  I spoke to a coworker who received her vaccine first dose around the time I did and she had a similar reaction.  Again, very mild but definitely additional redness, itching, and mild soreness at the injection site 9 days post the first dose after my initial symptoms had completely resolved.  This required no real treatment.  I iced it that evening, and it only lasted about 24 hours but it was surprising as the initial symptoms had completely resolved.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/13/21.  On 1/21/21 I felt itchy on my right arm.  When I looked it had hives, very red &amp; itchy, swollen and hot.  On  1/22/21 I went to a walk in clinic and was told to take Benadryl.  Currently it is still swollen, not so red with slight tenderness.

I was tired and muscle hurt, and a little dizzy for the next few days. Third day after injection, had an adverse event, severe dizziness and disorientation. Almost lost consciousness several times, but did not.  Mental thought process was affected. Had sensation of not receiving enough oxygen. Severe diarrhea and sick to my stomach, sinus congestion. Episode lasted several hours, next 24 hours was dizzy, weak, and soreness of arm. Had another slight episode of dizziness, sinus congestion, tiredness, and chills on day 11 after the vaccine.

                                                Initially, after vaccine I had mild pain at the injection site (no different from past vaccinations for influenza). About a week later I started to have a round red, itchy rash around injection site. Started about the size of a nickel and progressed to about 5 inches by 3 inches around the site on 1/22/21. Took Benadryl that night which helped with redness and itching. Has expanded a little since then, but much less red and less itchy.

Continued, along with itching, for 2-3 days, then was mostly gone except a warmth and slight discoloration (pink, not red). Began to feel fatigue within the next week. Then, around 1/17 or 18, the heat, pain, itching, and redness returned, along with a painful swelling on the left side  bottom of my mouth, and on the left side bottom of my tongue.  I&#39;d been told someone I knew had pain as well, and was prescribed Benadryl, so I took the over-the-counter type as directed, and within the second dose (after 4 hours), the pain and swelling receded in my mouth and on my arm. Within a day, I had no more mouth pain, and the arm feels better, although it&#39;s still pink, itchy, and warm.

                                                Itchy raised red rash or bumps near the vaccination site. May not be related because they didn&#39;t show up until 7 days after the vaccination some time in the evening of January 24. As of today, January 26, they are still there. I am using hydrocortisone cream to treat and trying not to scratch.  The area is hot to the touch and a little bit hard. It&#39;s possible it&#39;s a bugbite, but doesn&#39;t look like on. I have not reported to my doctor yet, but will later today. There are no other symptoms and I was able to sleep last night and am at work today.

                                                The first day I had pain in left arm around injection. Couldn&#39;t sleep on it. Next day it was itchy but pain had subsided. Next day itching was almost gone. By Wednesday January 27 I thought everything was gone. Getting dressed that night I noticed a red rash developed around or near injection site. About 1 inch by 2 inch oval, slightly raised, slightly warm, slightly itchy. This morning January 29, it is still there less itchy and less red, but still visible outline. I was being followed by vsafe up to wednesday afternoon the 27th. I thought I shouldn&#39;t wait til next week for the vsafe check in.

                                                While patient was waiting her 15 minutes after receiving the Moderna vaccine (1/21/2021), she complained of a bad pain in the left side of her neck &amp; that it was hard for her to breathe.  She was assisted by EMS (who was on site).  Her blood pressure was 249/149 per the patient.  She also experienced some lightheadedness.  It was strongly suggested by EMS &amp; nursing staff that she be transported to the ER but she refused stating she had to work the next day.  She continued to be monitored by EMS until her blood pressure stabilized &amp; she felt better.  She continued to refuse ER.  She was driven home by her companion.   On 1/28/2021 she sent an email to the health department showing a picture of her left arm showing redness from the injection site down to above the bend in her left arm.  She reported that on 1/26/2021 her physician  recommended that she not receive the second dose of Moderna.  She continues to complain of high blood pressure.  It is unkown if she takes medication for high blood pressure.

                                                About 3 PM she received her second vaccination for Covid.  She states that she has a history of adverse reactions to flu vaccines that are anaphylactic like in the past.  She usually premedicates with Benadryl and steroids.  Today she did take 100 mg of Benadryl prior to her vaccination.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine, she did feel like her throat was getting a little bit tight but she did not feel like it was true anaphylaxis.  However she then felt very off.  After this vaccine her throat started to feel tight, and she stated she did not feel well overall.  She did have some tunnel vision and was shaky. At about 1730 her heart rate drops to the 30s, she started feeling itchy, and then she went into a coughing fit and started to feel her throat close. She received 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, 20 mg IV famotidine, 125 mg IV methylprednisone, 0.5 mL of nebulized racepinephrine, and 500 mL NS bolus. She has since recovered and is stable on room air.

                                                Five days following the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed diffuse body pain, beginning in the right shoulder (for which she received a steroid injection), but then spreading to the entire body. This pain became so severe that she presented to the hospital via EMS, and was found to have a platelet count of 41 (9 days following the vaccine). No baseline platelet count is available prior to the vaccine (most recent was from 2019). Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is being considered, and the patient has been placed on IVIG and steroids. It is now 4 days into the patient&#39;s admission, and platelets continue to fall (currently 26). Hemoglobin appears normal at the time and there is no sign of active bleeding. Of note, the patient also has positive blood cultures, so thrombocytopenia as a result of sepsis is also a possibility.

Saturday evening began feeling itchy and painful nerve pain throughout my body.  Finally went to ER on Sunday evening and kept as inpatient until Tuesday 2/16.  I was also on an antibiotic for an infection and Dr.  feels that this was the primary source of my reaction, but not sure if it was compounded by the vaccination.  It?s been a rough couple of days, but feeling better now.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

                                                To preface, I&#39;m a physician (pediatrician).  I developed a swollen, indurated, erythematous itchy area approx 3x5 cm at the site of the vaccine the evening I received the vaccine, persisted a couple days, finally resolved leaving very slight induration behind.  EIGHT days after vaccine (on Dec 31), I received my regular allergy injections (one in each arm, below site of Moderna vaccine), that evening the site of the Moderna vaccine again became indurated, swollen, itchy/painful, red (redness was more widespread than the original reaction, I have pictures if needed), this lasted for about 72 hours, again leaving a very slightly indurated area behind.  Plan to do both allergy shots in the OTHER arm this week.

I took my temperature and headed to bed to rest, feel asleep and work up for another call and felt like my fever had broken with a sweat feeling. I felt much better and finished my night on call and home on holiday at 1 pm.

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

On 1/4/2021, the same area turned bright red, raised and extremely itchy ..now 2 inches x 1 inch.  Grew larger over course of several days and is now oval shape bright red and warm to touch roughly 5 inches h x 3 inches wide taking benadryl, zyrtec, pepcid , and using topical clobetasol to area still ongoing.  have seen my asthma allergy doctor

Walked in the bathroom had pain in stomach, was very hot and freezing at the same time, was shaking. Head hurt was hurting so bad. Tried standing up from toilet, was passed out. Eye, half of face is bruised and swollen , eye shut for two days. More than forty minutes passed before she could call her husband. Does not remember anything because she was passed out. Husband came in and grabbed her, to get her back into bed. she could not stand. Went to ER at  Hospital. Had CT scan, blood work , EKG, chest xray. Was still kind of out of it but was able to communicate with nurses. Face is still black and blue. Last night got up at 4:00 a.m. something was wrong with her throat. Felt like a walnut was in her throat. Went to doctor this morning. They said it was a reaction from the shot. Got an EpiPen, prednisone. Call them in 2 days to let them know how she&#39;s doing and also wear a heart monitor because they do not know how to take care of her, Has had vision blurriness in both eyes. Has not felt well at all.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

However, on day 8, there was a marked increase in redness, swelling, and itching similar to hives on the left deltoid.  After applying 2.5% cortisone cream (prescription I had on hand) and taking Ibuprofen and Tylenol for swelling and discomfort, the symptoms subsided over the next 3 to 5 days. On day 13 there is still occasional itching.

I kept feeling itchy and would have hive like welts when I scratched my skin.  I eventually went to the store and purchased Claritin to relieve the itchiness.

                                                I got fairly standard injection site reaction  (soreness,  a little deltoid swelling ,  and a 1.5&#34; harder,  red area) the first 3 days, which I didn&#39;t report as I expected it.  After 3 days it went away and I was surprised the tenderness went away so quickly as it can last longer with a flu shot. It stayed this way (injection site normal) for 4 days. One week after the shot I started to get an injection site reaction again and this time it is worse; red area is expanding, and is hotter and swollen,  I took some morning and night pictures over the last 1.5 days.

About day six it started to feel a bit better.  A week and a half later it still had a large hard knot at the injection site by 1.16.21 it started to itch. On 1.17.21 it began to itch really bad and swell  and get hard again, that evening I used topical Benadryl and hydrocortisone which made the itch dissipate slightly.   On 1.20. the swelling is noticeable from six feet away and can be seen popping up under my shirt sleeve.  I made an appointment with a doctor for 1.21.21.

Due to this we observed her for 30 minutes following administration of vaccine.  About 25 minutes into her observation period she began developing hives on her forearms and wasn&#39;t feeling her normal self.  She denied any respiratory symptoms but was continuously clearing her throat and when asked if she normally did that, she stated that she did not.  Decision was made to take vital signs and administer 50mg of IM Diphenhydramine.  She was agreeable to this plan .  After administering Diphenhydramine, we continued to monitor her vitals and had her stay another 45 minutes for observation.  Hives resolved and vital signs remained within normal limits.  Patient was education on allergic  reactions and she to seek medical care.  Patient verbalized understanding and felt  back to her normal self.

She was risk stratified into the high risk (30 minute obsevation) category based on a previous anaphylactic response to shelffish requiring epinhephrine. She reported only a minor pruritis after the first dose of the vaccine. While in the observation area she reported auditory exclusion to her male partner, then reportedly went unconcsious immediately.  Employees working in the observation area were notified and summoned medical assistance. A medical provider (PA) arrived and found the pt supine in the passenger seat and unresponsive. Her pulse was weak and thready. One dose of 0.3mg epi autoinjector was administered to her R lateral thigh at 12:03p

Very tired and did not feel well.  Low grade fever was sporadic.   Could not go to work. Called Dr. about symptoms and prescribe antiobiotic of Ceftin for the sore throat..  Sore throat went away after 24 to 48 hours of being on medicine. By day 10 all the skin reactions had calmed down and by day 12 was feeling good.  Dr. wanted me to report to you guys.  He was unsure if I should take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  He seemed confident throughout that this was an immune response to the vaccine.

Was noticeable for 2 days. Felt a little lethargic that day but not ill. No fever or pain. Did not see rash listed as a reportable event on VAERS site but was advised to report rash anyway.

                                                I received my first vaccination on 12/28/2020, given very high in my right arm.  I noticed a tingling in my left arm within the first 15 minutes of the injection.  As I worked the rest of my evening shift, the tingling continued.  The next morning, my left arm was numb from the shoulder to the fingertips.  I could move my fingers and arm, but could not feel pain, hot or cold.  I called the employee health nurse, who told me that most symptoms resolve in 24 hours.  I took a day off and rested the arm.  The feeling came back gradually in the afternoon.  However, my hand was numb the following two mornings.  The symptoms resolved in 72 hours.

                                                On  January 16, the day after being vaccinated (1/15/21),  I woke up with my arms, hands, legs and feet tingling and numb all over and it lasted on and off all day January 16 and on and off all day January 17 and has persisted every day until Monday, January 26 when the symptoms became worse. Instead of tingling in all extremities (with some numbness)  the sensations changed to a pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shock sensations. I want to note that, yes, I have radiculopathies  - however, I have never had them change so suddenly and increase in intensity so fast. Also, the pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shocks are brand new symptoms for me (my radiculopathies have not presented this way before).  I reported these symptoms to my primary care provider today (1/29/21) and she instructed me to report my symptoms to VAERS and she is referring me to neurology. Note: I received my vaccination outside of my health care system and received it through the county because I could get the vaccination sooner that way.  I did not report these symptoms sooner because they were not listed as a possible adverse effect of getting the COVID19 Moderna  vaccination. However, as these symptoms have worsened over the past 2 weeks I have become concerned.  I have not added any OTC medications or supplements to the ones listed prior. I have gone to a chiropractor twice during this time for relief of my back pain with  no positive outcomes. Waiting to see the neurologist.

On January 15 developed an itchy, red, hot rash about 1/2 inch below injection site.  The area was approximately 3 in by2.5 in with swelling.  Also had 5 hives break out on my body.  I took 1/2 a Benedryl and used clobetasol propionate ointment on the area until the rash went away (7 days).  The swelling took another 5 days to subside.

                                                I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my PMD office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

The allergic symptoms have not come back as of this reporting.

Increasing fatigue which maxed around 11am accompanied by  cold shivers and increased body temp . Fever picked at 5pm to 101.3F.  By 10pm fever and fatigue were gone! Day 2 after the vaccination: a red rash size 2 inch x 3 inch on the arm around the place of the injection, pain in the arm was nearly gone, no fever, no fatigue. Day 3 after the vaccination: red rash is gone. Back to normal.

Then on Thursday, every joint in her body hurt and this continued until Saturday.  On Saturday she had a big red whelt on the arm that progressively got larger.  She still has some aches in her joints, but not as severe.  The rash is deep red today, swollen with hard ridges, very itchy and very hot to touch.  She has not taken anything for it.  She has been having a harder time than usual breathing, but not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine or not.  She has less than 20% of her lungs.

                                                Classic ?Covid arm?, subcutaneous hypersensitivity.  Began ten days after shot and currently 48 hours since apparent onset.  Site size steadily increasing, puffy, red, hot to touch. Originally itched but that has decreased.  Still active situation. Not recovered yet.   Note: I had a similar reaction to a pneumonia shot in Spring 2016. Was just surprised this took so long as everything seemed fine. But reading online, it appears normal but still small number with this reaction.

Contacted via phone and e-mail, Occupational Health Services on 1/1/2021. I also saw  an ED physician at on 1/1/2021 who said a local inflammation reaction was unlikely, probably cellulitis, and prescribed doxycycline. The affected area of my arm was marked to follow progression of red, warm area.  Began doxycycline 1/1/2021. Next morning red, warm area of arm is now outside of marked area and down to below my elbow.  I have an appointment with Occupational Health on Monday, January 4,2021.

On Thursday 12/31/2020 I had pain, erythema and redness around the site of injection. For treatment I took an OTC Benadryl, applied hydrocortisone cream and used topical Arnicare gel for the pain.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

                                                V safe was checking in with me for the first 7 days.  I initially on the first day after having the shot had a headache and Very sore arm.  The soreness lasted only one day and then no other symptoms until day 8.  On day 8, the injection site was red, itchy and raised.  Then yesterday, day 9 my are was tender to touch, VERY RED and HOT and expanding all over my arm, now in the back of my arm.  All the time remaining afebrile.  V-safe will only check in with me once a week from day 7, for 5 weeks, I am told so I wanted to report this.  I am waiting for a call from my PCP.  She is considering cellulitis, that is how red and hot it is but it is only tender, not hurting or requiring any pain medication.  I have good range of motion, too.

                                                *8 days after injection i discovered a hard lump (6am)at injection site . by Noon this area was red, sore, swollen and very hot (102). I went to the auditorium where i received the shot at 3pm. the nurses said they have not experienced this 8 days out. A doctor 9dermatologist ) looked at it and drew a circle around the red area and said if the redness spreads to seek medical attention. He asked the nurse not to document this. I went to the ER and the doctor treated me for infection/ cellulitis. After 3 days on antibiotics it has subsided by half.

                                                Eleven (11) days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna Vaccine, My upper left arm showed signs of a rash.  I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on it and showed my arm to my doctor on Wednesday, January 13 2021.  At that time Dr.  stated that it was a reaction to the Moderna Vaccine.  As of today (1/14/2021), the rash appears to be spreading across my upper left arm.  I am applying icepacks in the evening at home.

Woke up on Jan 13 2021 with itching, redness and swelling at the site of the injection. The irritation continues. It is not worse but not better either.

                                                Eight days after receiving the vaccine (1/7/2021) I noticed my upper left arm felt hard when I touched it; no discomfort.  Later the same day after returning home from work I changed my clothing and noted my upper left arm was swollen, very red and felt hot when I touched it.  The red/swollen area extended from just below where I received the vaccine to just above the elbow.  I thought maybe I had a spider bite, but couldn&#39;t find anything that looked like the site of a bite.  The following day I coincidentally had an appointment for my annual physical, so I mentioned it to my physician.  He didn&#39;t see anything that looked like a bite, but did see the redness and swelling.  The swelling subsided after a couple days.  The red color on my skin faded and was totally gone on 1/14/2021.

I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

                                                Started with itching and rash at injection site. Went away in 2 days. Next day palm of hands and soles of feet became very itchy. Then progressed to whole body itching. Unable to sleep for two nights. Went to urgent care next morning. Was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg. Itching went away that night and was able to sleep. Next day bilateral hands had numbness and tingling and general dizziness so stopped taking hydroxyzine. Went to family practitioner and was prescribed methylprednisolone dose pack.

On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

                                                Sunday, 1/24/21 arm started to itch.  Did scratch on it a little bit.  She then noticed it felt more like it itched, looked in the mirror and saw the rash line.  Originally it was just a sore arm at the site of vaccine.  2nd day the arm was sore, by noon on Monday everything was gone, and 5 days later now has the rash.  Rash area is 1 1/2&#34; wide and 3&#34; long in a line.  Really firm to touch where red parts to touch and feels a bit warm to the touch.  Has not touched it or bothered it since.  Today, her doctor has prescribed medications, but has not picked it up, antibiotic of some sort.

BUT one week after that injection (Friday 1/22) I noticed my arm getting very sore, swollen and hot in the same injection site and several inches below?about the size of my palm. It continued to get more swollen and hotter for a couple of days, then a mild red rash appeared covering the whole affected skin surface by Sunday 1/24  &amp; then it all had slowly, basically, disappeared by Wed 1/27 night.

                                                My right arm was painful at the injection site for 3 days after the vaccination.  Then on Wednesday, February 3, 2021 about 3:45pm I experienced shortness of breath and some chest discomfort.  At approximately 6:00pm, I felt a strong pulsating at my left temple which continued through the night.  I took my blood pressure and it was 150/90 and pulse was 103 which is the highest reading I have ever had because I am on blood pressure medication.  I took 2 aspirin, my Proventil Inhaler, and another Losartan 50 mg even though I had already taken my daily dose in the morning.  I rested and continued to monitor my vitals.  At about 11:30pm, I took my blood pressure and it was 160/110 and pulse was 109.  I then took 2 more aspirin and my Clonazapem and fell asleep.  In the morning on February 4, 2021, I tried to get in to see my doctor, but she advised to go to the emergency room.  I went to an Urgent Care facility and the checked me and did an EKG and that was normal.  But they also advised me to go to the emergency room.  So I did go and they did another EKG, chest x-ray, and several blood tests.  They came back normal but they wanted me to stay overnight for observation.  On February 5, 2021 they did an echocardiogram and a stress test, which were normal.  I was released from the hospital that afternoon.  I have a follow up appointment with my Primary Care Physician on February 12, 2021.  My blood pressure and pulse continue to be a little higher than normal.  At this point, the pulsating, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort have improved.  On Saturday, February 6, 2021, I noticed felt itchiness, redness and swelling at the injection site on my right arm.  It is still itchy, red and swollen as of February 8, 2021.  I am putting hydrocortisone cream on it.

Then 7 days after the vaccine my injection site became very swollen, red, very hard in the injection area and itchy.  I also felt slightly achy and had a headache for 3 days before that. Now 2 days later the reddened area is larger and circular like a target. Skin is warm to the touch and itchy.  I?m no longer achy and no more headaches.  The swelling in the left arm has decreased slightly but the redness is bigger.

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

                                                Patient was vaccinated on 3/9/21 at facility in the morning. She developed a headache later that day. She woke up on 3/10/21 around 1145 with facial/neck swelling, urticaria,  and shortness of breath and presented to the ER at 1250. Upon arrival she was given 50mg benadryl IVP, 20mg Pepcid IVP, and 125mg Solu-medrol IVP. Soft tissue neck xray showed subglottic narrowing and thickened epiglottis. She had some improvement after IV medications but was admitted to ICU for observation overnight. She was discharged 3/12/2021 in stable conditions on steroids and antihistamines. Pt&#39;s vaccine card did not list vaccine lot number. I reached out to facility for the lot number and have not heard back.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

Went to clinic 01/05/21, Dr marked the site. Advised to apply ice and use topical benedryl (I did not have at home). Next day, worsened, injection site, very red, itchy, burning, and had redness had spread beyond the markings of Dr. On 01/06/21 went to clinic, saw PAC. Put me on antibiotics.  Stated allergic reaction and looked like cellulitis too.  Today arm is less swollen, but still red and itchy. Going back to clinic to see Dr Friday 01/08/21 at 10:30 am

                                                Day following vaccine, had extreme fatigue, headache, low grade fever, injection site redness  and swelling. All symptoms subsided after the first 48 hours with the exception of the injection site redness that lasted for 5 days along with itching at the site. The redness is now gone but itching at the site still remains at the injection site as of today-day 10. I consider the itching to be a minor side effect, and not severe enough to prevent me from getting the 2nd vaccination.

                                                I had an allergic reaction at the site of injection on my left arm. I applied alcohol and a new bandaid at 10:30 pm and went to bed. I woke up at 3 am with my left arm in serious pain. I removed the bandaid and the top skin was removed at the site of the bandaid. The area was swollen and inflamed red with a large circle on my upper left arm.

No reddness or swelling, not firm but extremely tender to touch. Pain at injection site was present for 2 days then resolved slowly..

                                                one week following the vaccine, 1/11/2021 I noticed pain and swelling and itching on my left arm surrounding the injection site. The area was reddish and raised, - about  3 inches by 5 inches and was hot to the touch, itchy and sore.  It kept me awake at night. I was seen by my primary doctor the next day 1/12/2021 and he said to apply a Benadryl cream to ease the itching and report back if I spiked a fever. I started using the Benadryl cream that evening of the  12th and the pain and itching has been gradually decreasing. The shade of pink is lighter today  1/14 and swelling is mostly gone but skin is still hot to the touch and Im still putting on the Benadryl cream 2x/day. I have not had a fever and have no other symptoms.

Two weeks after vaccine I had an appointment with my dermatologist. She noticed there was still a large red area around the injection site. It is no longer tender and does not itch however she felt I should report it. As of today the large red area is still there.

My arm felt fine except it felt bruised at the injection site the next morning.  A day or 2 later it was a bit red and warm but went away after a couple days.  Today, 8 days after the injection, the site is inflamed.  It is red, warm, and about 3- 4 inches in diameter.  It has more discomfort today than it has in the past week although I still have mobility in my arm.

                                                Patient is another women who has h/o allergies to food and medications. She came prepared with her own Benadryl and Epipen. I watched her for almost 45 minutes and only thing she C/O was some itching in her head at 25-30 minutes after the shot. So I advised to take her own 25 mg po of Benadryl. When she left she was not itching. She had no other problems like hives, SOB, swollen eyes, chest pain, stridor, nausea, vomiting. She was alert and oriented X3 throughout her visit in post vaccination area. I was talking to her throughout her stay on and off.  Her O2 sat was also good.  I informed her on skin care, told her to drink enough fluids, take Benadryl po Q6-8 hours for the next 1-2 days. If any problems go to ER. She informed me that she was very anxious and she gets itching every time when she becomes hyperactive with lots of people.

She stated that she was dizzy but that she does suffer from vertigo already. She said these symptoms lasted about a week. On the 1/14/21 she was tachycardic, dizzy, weak and she had a raised red rash distal to the site of injection. She went to urgent care and was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic. On 1/17/21 she went back to urgent care since the rash had migrated and appeared patchier than cellulitis. Her doctor said that he did not believe it to be cellulitis at this time and prescribed her a steroid cream.

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

There had been a local injection site reaction as well as fatigue and headache starting 24  hours after vaccine administration, which had resolved entirely within 72 hours.  New onset of injection site reaction began with pruritis only, starting in the morning 7 days after the vaccination, which progressed to include fatigue, erythema and induration during that day and into the next (today, the day of reporting). Oral certrizine was taken the evening that symptom recrudescence began, with some relief of pruritis but not erythema or induration.

On or about 12/28/2020 mild to moderate 5/10 began of left shoulder radiating down to left arm, x-rays were done on left shoulder and humerus. No acute findings noted. Few days later Medrol dose pak was ordered due worsening pain of left upper back, left arm and hand. 01/19/2021 telemedicine with MD to get stronger pain medication.

On 30 Dec 2020, approximately four hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot Number: 025J20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Dec 2020, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced warmth, redness, and pain in the arm which she treated with ice and diphenhydramine.  On 31st Dec 2020, 14 hours after vaccine administration, the patient started to experience bullous eruption on her arm, pruritis and constant burning sensation in the arm. She reported having swelling extended down to her arm, bruising, discoloration, blisters, small vesicular pustules, erythema down to the side of the arm, and demarcation. She spoke to her primary care provider as her rash continued to evolve. She was started on a methylprednisolone pack but only took two doses for concern it would blunt the immune response to the vaccine. Additionally, she was treated with triamcinolone ointment.  On 03 Jan 2021, the bullous eruptions peeled off with sloughed skin, she had an excoriated area underneath the skin. She also had tenderness and pain in the arm which resolved spontaneously. The patient self-treated the events with benzethonium chloride and vitamin E oil.  On 28th Jan 2021, the patient had hyperpigmentation of her posterior arm with an excoriated area.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, bullous eruption on her arm, bruising, discoloration, blisters, vesicular pustules, significant pruritus, hyperpigmentation, constant burning sensation, arm felt warm, bullous eruption eventually peeled off with &#34;sloughed skin&#34;, redness down to side of the arm and demarcation, looks like a burn, her arm felt warm, painful and was red, and swelling extended down to her arm, was not reported.

However 13th day after receiving injection  I developed severe fatigue, fevers as high as 101.9, shaking, nausea, severe itching.  overall feeling of sick.  3 days later it passed. Due to my preexisting conditions I have isolated myself for almost 1 year, followed all protocols, and very rarely out in public. I also recieved flu vaccine.  So doubt the symptoms I had could be contributed to flu bug. So since it seemed very odd I am reporting this to CDC. Note: I had 2nd dose 02/19/21. So far only reaction is sore injection site. Should I develop symptoms after several days like the ones I reported after 1st dose, I will report these to this site.

On 2/20/21 still a slight headache, took 2 Tylenol then went out and walked about a mile, visited family, then walked back home.  By the time I got home I was barely able to walk up the stairs.  Felt exhausted and nauseous.  Slept for a few hours and got up and just sat on the couch for another few hours and then felt that same nausea and exhaustion and went to bed. Took 2 more Tylenol. Started drinking more water.  On 2/21/21 felt pretty good -- stayed in all day -- ate a little -- but saw the site on my arm just under the injection site was very large, red, and hot to the touch.  The red welt area went from just below the injection in the left arm to just above the elbow.   On 2/22/21 (today) feel pretty good.  Drinking a lot of water and tool 1 Tylenol.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA,      My legs were getting sore and tired at work. I sat down to tie my shoe and noted Pitting &#43; 3 or 4 edema to BIL Calves.  Redness , warmth in a few areas.  R leg 1&#34; larger than L.  Then  I mentioned it to another nurse and  she said it could be side affect of Norvasc.  I spoke with my PA about it on 2/12 she D&#39;C&#39;d Norvasc and perscribed  Nefidepine 30 mg ER. I have not taken it yet I am monitoring my BP and it is WNL.   The edema less in calves however continues in ankles.  I have gotten MULTIPLE broken capillaries all over my legs.          Long short it has to be a reaction to vaccine.  And it continues almost 2 months after injection.   I can&#39;t wear most of my socks.  It is BAD.

Hip to below knew, dull and numbish; from below knee thru toes, same tingling as fingers. Biggest concern was side of face and jaw; dull and numbish. All these reactions occurred on right side of body. Thursday late afternoon, the tingling and the dull and numbish diminishes but the arm aching along with inability to completely raise remains. Friday; arm remains the same Saturday; arm below injection site now feels only bruised NOTE: while I enjoy a strong immune system, by body is very sensitive to new medicines/tweaking medicines. Also applies to food.  APPROX 25 years ago, I believe I contracted Gullian Barre, where the immune system attacks nervous system. There was./is no test to confirm although I continue to endure some side effects. QUESTION- with all said is it advisable to receive the 2nd vaccine shot?   Please advise ASAP

                                                The person who gave me the shot placed the injection too low on my arm. It should have been up near the shoulder, but instead the person gave it to me down toward the middle of my arm. I knew something was wrong immediately because it felt so warm and disruptive. The doctor on the scene said it was nothing. Nine days later I went to Urgent Care with swelling, hot-to-the-touch, itchy and a huge knot. The Urgent Care Dr. gave me a five-day prescription for Prednisone and also gave me a prescription for hydroXYzine pamoate, which is an antihistimine.

                                                Reported to me by onsite staff:  Patient seemed to tolerate the vaccine fine at time of administration.  Following day (appx 24 hours) following administration, patient was having fever and unresponsive.  Patient also had local, large, hard hematoma at injection site.  It is worth noting that the patient had recently completed CDC recommended isolation protocol, and was symptom free at time of administration - determining they were qualified to get vaccine.  The facility is also aware that the patient&#39;s present condition could be related to an active COVID 19 infection / relapse.

I was taken to a room and had vitals and was hypertensive and tachycardic with a worsening headache, I was given 50 mg Benadryl and put ice on my face and neck for about 20 minutes as I felt I was burning up. I remained at the clinic for an hour for monitoring. I never had difficulty breathing , and it was mostly resolved in about 45 minutes except for the mild headache and my face was still red and my eyes were swollen for at least an hour.

                                                I had soreness in the left arm for @ 2 days after the vaccination.  No redness, no swelling.   After that, no known problem.  Exactly one week after the injection, On the morning of Tuesday, January 5, 2021, I noticed soreness in my left arm similar to what I had right after the injection. It was painful to extend my arm over my head.  Later that day, I noticed a small 1 3/4&#34; x 1&#34; area of redness and warmth appearing at or right next to the area of the injection.  Over the next 24-48 hours, the area grew and became swollen, more red, and warmer.  The soreness in my arm didn&#39;t seem to change at all; it was painful to lift my arm overhead and to touch.  The area grew to approximately 3&#34; x 4&#34; during that time period.  On Thursday morning, 1/7/21, my PCP, inspected the area and felt the swelling and the warmth.  She believed that I had likely developed cellulitis in the arm and placed me on cephalexin 500 mg, one capsule tid.  I began taking that on Thursday afternoon, 1/7/21.   By Friday evening, the area was barely visible, but was still warm and a little swollen.  It was still slightly tender. Today, Saturday, 1/9/21, the area is still a little warm and slightly swollen, but not visible at all, and there is only tenderness if I press on the area.

All of these symptoms lasted about three and a half hours. At about four hours after the shot, I began to have diarrhea.

Then on Jan.7 I began to have itching at the injection site and a 3x4 inch area of redness.  I applied some OTC 1% hydrocortisone cream which did lessen the itching but redness persisted.  Today, Jan.10 the redness measures approximately 3 1/2 x 4 1/2 inches, itching is present at times and area is warm to the touch.  I have no fever and arm feels only slightly tender right where needle was inserted.

                                                L upper arm started itching badly 1/5/21 later in the afternoon.  I finally looked at it in the evening.  The skin was red around the injection site, at least 3x5&#34;.  At the margin there were a number of small hives and the entire area was hot and indurated.  It was not painful, just itchy.  The next day the hives were gone but the area was larger, and still red, hot and indurated.  It continued that way and grew in size that day and the next.  Itching improved and by Friday 1/8 the redness was gone (almost completely encircled my arm at one point).  I still have occasional itching.  One of the physicians I work with said it was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction and that I should get the 2nd shot in the R arm and pre-medicate.

                                                7 days after receiving the 1st moderna shot I woke up with an itchy upper right arm in the area I received the shot, It felt warm to the touch and was angry red in color. I drew an ink line around the border, and by the end of the day, it was about an inch out of the original border. Started out about 3 0r 4 inches wide and about the same long. I treated it with cortisone cream, baking soda poultice,  calamine lotion. I took ibuprophen and took two Benadryl at night before going to bed. The next morning the redness was less noticeable, still itchy, but by the next day it was about gone. So about 48 hours. A co worker also had this happen to her 7 days later

After 24 hours, my right eye lid started to catch when I started to blink. I call it lid lag. It has persisted longer than 24 hours.  My eye lid does not blink the same as my left eye. It&#39;s like a brief before it returns to my regular eye lid. There has been no worsening,  and no improvement, it has remained the same.

A week later, increased soreness at injection site, entire upper third portion of my  arm was red, warm to the touch, sometimes itchy.  Arm felt tight and firm.  Slight headache which advil seemed to manage throughout the day.   1/12/21 woke with jaw pain, neck pain in back of neck on both sides, headache, temp of 99.2.  Took advil.  Two hours later all those symptoms were gone and did not return.  I have felt fine ever since. Arm is no longer sore, but redness still present, though seems to be lessening.

Today, 1/15/2021, I noticed I had a red area around my arm where the vaccine was given.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it was hot as my hands were cold.  A nurse in our office looked at and said it did feel warm. I am having no other problems...just thought it was strange it would appear 10 days later.  I do want to get the 2nd shot when I am able.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At about 8 pm the day following my vaccination; I started to experience sharp needle-like pain at the site of injection (left arm).  It was brief.  Immediately following that pain, the fingers on my left hand went numb and I couldn&#39;t feel them -- particularly my pinky and ring fingers.  I could move my fingers but they were numb.  I did not have a fever. This lasted about 2 hours.  I iced the site of injection, kept my hand above my shoulder and massaged my fingers for the duration (about 2 hours).  When this first occurred my heart was racing -- but that might have been because it scared me.  I feel fine today.

                                                I received the 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine on January 10, 2021 and had no reaction.  On January 18, 2021, I noticed a big red circular spot around the injection site (left arm).  It was warm, raised, and felt like a burning sensation.  Everyday after January 18, 2021, it has slowly gone down and not as red.  As of today, January 22, 2021, it has now disappeared.

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

                                                After the vaccine on Jan 16, 2021, I had a sore arm with minor inflammation for 3 days.  This subsided without any over the counter medications.  Yesterday at about 5 pm, my arm started to itch slightly at the site of the shot.  Upon waking up this morning, my upper arm has a red circle and is inflamed and it hurts again.  I applied prescription cortisone and will continue to apply throughout the day.   The soreness seems about the same pain level as the first 3 days after receiving the shot.  There is no evidence of bug bite and it would be very strange if I got bit in the exact same location as the shot.

Approximately 12:30-1:00 AM on 01/09/2021 woke up, turned my head and experienced room spinning dizziness for about 2 minutes. Had to remain completely still to stop the room spinning.  For the next 2 days (until the morning of Monday 01/11/2021)  I experienced on and off room spinning dizziness at unpredictable intervals.  Usually didn&#39;t last longer than 2 minutes but had to remain completely still to stop the spinning.   Starting on Monday 01/11/2021 had &#34;normal&#34; dizziness along with some flu like symptoms,  headache, tiredness,  soreness/achiness and extreme soreness and pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine shot. I stayed out of work because of the on-going dizziness. These symptoms continued until Saturday 01/16/2021.  I took an antihistamine on Saturday night and finally woke up Sunday 01/17/2021 with no dizziness.

Then 7 days later in the evening, the injection site began to itch.   The area around the injection site is raised and slightly red again,  It is not painful like the first time, but now itchy.   It had totally disappeared and is back again.   Is this normal and nothing to worry about?

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

                                                The afternoon after I developed chills and had goose bumps all over.  I didnt have a fever but the chills went on for several hrs so I took 2 500mg tylenol and the chills ended around 5pm.  I developed a headache and still had to continue to drink plenty water because my mouth got that super dry feeling again.  I went home ate and relaxed until I fell asleep.  I had body aches and because my arm was hurting I couldnt lay on that side.  I took benedryl and tylenol before bed. Today I still feel very very tired, fatigued and my body still aches.  My arm is still really red, warm to the touch and has a nice knot at the injection site and the headache comes and goes.

Took tylenol before getting vaccine, and the next day around 4 in the morning started having malaise, pain, fever, chills. (fever around 102), and went 104 around midafternoon, and 106 around 10. Chills, pain, weakness. Next day I was feeling well. I started noticing small dots on knee and shoulder. And then I started noticing bruising on my hands and legs. Felt fine on Sunday. I started noticing the bruises were becoming more pronounced. On Monday when I woke up the bruises were worse, and I went to the ER. The doctor checked CBC and platelets count was low around 28 thousand and was admitted into the hospital and they treated me with solumedrol 100 mg. Platelets count went back up.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 039K20A) on 31 Dec 2020.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 209K20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an undisclosed date the patient experienced injection site soreness, generalized body pain all over, chills, low grade fever and weakness.  She also went to the hospital because she had a platelet count of 28,000.   Treatment of these events was not provided.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events, platelet count of 28,000, generalized body pain all over, weakness, on and off chills, low grade fever, and vaccination site soreness, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Started where the shot was and spread. By Sunday the color was gradually fading. No burning or itching. Wouldn&#39;t have noticed if I hadn&#39;t looked in the mirror. Up until 02/20/2021 there had been no reaction of any kind.&#34;  As of today, 02/22/2021, she states&#34; it is a pinkish color and has spread from shoulder to elbow. I went on the internet and found out that it&#39;s called &#34;COVID ARM&#34;&#34;

                                                Arm was very sore starting day after injection and for a couple of days. After that there was very slight periodic itch at injection site. Happened a few times a day for several days. On day 8 after vaccine, Feb 20, a raised welt-like patch appeared on arm near the injection site. Measured approximately 2&#34; x 3&#34;. Lasted for 24 hours. The red area increased and the welt-like raised area subsided the next day. By Feb 22 there was a larger slightly red area left and the periodic itching returned. I am reporting this as it happened so many days after the injection.

                                                Part of the vaccine ran out at time of injection.  The night of the injection my arm started itching.  I was awakened at 4;00 a.m. the next morning with a very stiff, sore, cramping arm.  I had the normal reactions: slight headache, low temp, itchy, swollen, hot red arm, but very stiff and sore. This lasted 3-4 days with the most noticeable reaction being the sore arm from shoulder to elbow.  On Feb 10, one week later, my arm started itching again in the afternoon and by evening was swollen, red, hot, and hurting  just like the first 3-4 days or slightly worse.  It gradually got better after 4-5 days, returning to normal by 2/20.  The only other symptom the second time were blisters on my left hand above my pointer finger and ring finger.  I&#39;m not sure if they were related or not since I walk outside or if I may have been exposed to poison ivy since the blisters looked similar.

Went directly to ED. Sats  were good, no wheeze, throat swelling was noted. BP initially 150/93, peaked at 189/93,. Was 148/67 at discharge. Received oral Benadryl and Zyrtec, IV dexamethasone and Pepcid. ECG was done, no other labs. Observed for approx 90 minutes with improvement of all symptoms. Did need to take additional Benadryl dose approx 5 hours after first dose for return of mild throat fullness and rising BP. Both resolved within 30 minutes of dose. No further throat symptoms, BP fluctuations for over 24 hours now

                                                About five days after vaccine administration I noticed an inflammation of the area of the achilles tendon of left foot. Since I am not prone to inflammation of any sort nor did I have any strain or trauma, I took notice. I do not CHF (causing swelling of the ankles). The area of inflammation is tender, a bit red and a bit swollen. It is worrisome since I have never had anything like this in the past. I WILL NEED FOLLOW UP ON THIS. I AM UNSURE IF I SHOULD RECEIVE THE SECOND VACCINE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF SIMILAR INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES HAVE BEEN REPORTED, WHETHER IN ANKLE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BODY.  I realize that this may not be a typical vaccine reaction BUT this is a brand new vaccine, has not been time-tested, is only permitted by the FDA to be administered under these emergency circumstances. SO all possible reactions must be taken seriously and recorded. We are the guinea pigs. Also. I was handed a packet of papers when I received the vaccine. To register for v-safe the only two options given for registration were smart phone browser or QR code. I do not have a cell phone. So this leaves me out of the loop, which I think is unfair and unwise. Why can computer registration not be made available, and if it can then why doesn&#39;t the instruction sheet tell of this? In rural areas not everyone has a cell phone nor is cell service available to all areas.

On the 12th I noticed a raised area in the injection site. I took an Advil .  On the 13th my arm started getting hard near the injection site with some redness. On that day I took a Benadryl once and Advil BID. Today the arm is very hard, red and is warm to the touch. My temp is 100.2. I took 80 mg ASA and a hour later took an Advil.  I reported all my Sx w/ Moderna. They recommended that I call my PMD for Tx. I contacted my PMD and the health department for treatment and they referred me to CDC. No treatment was suggested or given

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011L20A) intramurally in the left deltoid bursa for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 02 Jan 2021, the patient reported she had been given the vaccine in the wrong location. The vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle. The patient was also experiencing loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and she also can&#39;t sleep. Treatment information was not provided. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. The event vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle was considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events loss of range of motion, can&#39;t sleep, and pain at the injection site were considered not recovered/not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of 65 year old female patient who experienced non-serious unexpected events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle for mRNA-1273, lot #  011L20A. The patient experienced loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and can&#39;t sleep. Onset latency was not provided.  De-challenge and re-challenge are not applicable. Based on the information provided the events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle, loss of range of motion and can&#39;t sleep are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 as this is due to product administration error. The event of pain at the injection site is included in the known safety profile of the vaccine, hence a causal association cannot be excluded.

The redness went down my arm to my inner elbow down my forearm to my wrist. The redness going down my arm was not as bad after I took the Allegra.  It was all extremely painful. I had to go see Dr. because the itching was so bad. Dr. prescribed medicine for the swelling/itching.  At times my throat was sore and my face was flushed and I had a tightness in my chest. But that did not last long.

Redness and tenderness went away after 3 days, however lump at injection site remained.  Redness and skin irritation suddenly appeared 2 weeks after injection along with slight chill sensation up and down arm.  Skin around injection site is very sensitive to touch.  I can see exactly where the injection was given 2 weeks ago as the needle entrance point is red.  I have applied Benadryl spray to the injection site and applied a bandage to prevent irritation from clothing rubbing site.

The fatigue, muscle aches, weakness/lightheadedness  is still there along with pain and swelling at the injection site.

                                                Late on the 7th day after the vaccine (Sunday, Jan 17) my arm a bit below the vaccine site started to itch.  I get skin itching sometimes and put  prescription Ultravate lotion on it.  The next morning (Jan 18) it itched more and the Ultravate did not to relieve it, so I put hydrocortisone cream on it and that made the itching stop.  The area that itched was about the size of a golf ball and was red. I put hydrocortisone cream on Jan 19 once in the morning and at night.  Today, Jan 20 when I woke up the area is red and about 4&#34; long and 3&#34; across, mostly below the injection site. It itches some. I don&#39;t have a primary care physician.

                                                On day 8 hard lump the size of palm developed over vaccine site as well as a red spotty rash on top of lump. The next day the hard lump turned into the size of a hand and there was a red circle fully red inside with a defined edge over this lump. Went to doctor was told they don?t know what it was maybe to be safe gave her antibiotics in case it was cellulitis and that is all she was given. Seems to be going down but still a small lump

                                                One week after receiving first dose, developed intense itching and redness at area of and surrounding injection site. First time woke me from sleep around 1 AM(?), so unsure how long it lasted.  I forgot about it until it started again. Intense itching started again around 11 AM lasted about 1-1.5 hours. This was first time I looked at it and the area was blotchy, slightly red (~ 5 cm)and there were some urticaria and an underlying rash. Slight redness remained all day. Itching returned several times that day but did not last as long. Hydrocortisone cream helped. It is still present as of today,  but is resolving with intermittent redness and itching.

Was 3 inches by two inches. The arm is now back to normal.  .2. Day 8.  Woke at roughly midnight with extreme heat and burning in all toes.  Quite painful.  Very unusual, as I have never experienced anything like this before.  When pain and burning became overwhelming I took Tylenol.  It helped and I was able to sleep.   The next morning the pain and burning were gone but my toes were, and continue to be quite numb, as is the area of my feet that surrounds my toes.  I can&#39;t fully feel my socks, shoes, sheets, etc.  It feel like I have cotton stuffed in my shoes.  It is hard for me to related the level of heat, burning and pain that happened.  I felt like I could melt a block of ice with my feet.  It was severe. I marked &#34;disability or permanent damage&#34; below because I don&#39;t know if the nerves in my feet will return to normal.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

                                                Approximately 35 minutes post vaccine administration I noticed a tingling sensation in my left facial area from mycheek area to my temple.  Later the same evening the sensation included the area below my left cheek.  A few days later the affected area appeared to move closer to my nose. On 01/28/2021 I notified Dr office and was recommended to go to Urgent Care to be evaluated, which I did.  Urgent Care recommended I go to Emergency Department for a further evaluation, which I did.  I was given an EKG and a physical exam. Both were essentially normal and my final diagnosis was left facial numbness.

Body aches especially in lower back area on right side at waist level  I was given Kevlex first, the vancomycin iintravenously in the ER, doxycylin at home, also taking benedryl at night.

On  1/26/21, my left arm at the injection site started to be slightly itchy. The following morning, the area was constantly itching. That evening, I looked at my left arm at the site, and I have broken out in hives, the muscle is swollen and warm and I am having to take an antihistamine twice a day so it does not itch but it continues to be red, itchy and swollen.

                                                Initial normal redness and tenderness of injection site (about size of silver dollar) cleared after several days, but on evening of day 9 (1/25/21),  large round redness, with hardness and heat suddenly reappeared and expanded.  Given history of cellulitis, I consulted primary care physicians office and was seen 1/26/21.  Agreed to treat with antibiotic cephalexin if perimeter still expanding by morning of 1/17/21, which it was.  After 48 hours on antibiotic, looking much better, but itchy. Advised today to stop antibiotic as medical clinic has become aware of &#34;Covid Arm&#34; rash in USA Today article, and I was advised to report this event to VAERS.  Now suspecting this is delayed rash not cellulitis.  Will prep right arm for #2 vaccine on 2/13/21 with ChloraPrep and monitor.

                                                starting February 5, I had mild swelling in the entire left leg treated with ice and anti-inflammatories. There was no redness, swelling, or pain at injection site. Symptoms seemed to be slowly subsiding. However, Thursday 2/11/21, I had a small patch of itchy, (but not painful) red rash on back of left thigh. By Thursday evening it had doubled in size. Friday am (2/12/21) it was a little bigger still. Then by Friday after work, my entire left leg was moderate to severely swollen and the rash covered a large part of the back of right thigh and was beginning to spread to the back of left calf.  Friday evening, I visited Urgent Care. The doctor there was concerned about a possible DVT and sent me to the ER. At ER, an ultrasound revealed no DVT. At no time did I have a fever. The ER doctor admitted me to the hospital where I remained until the afternoon of Monday, February 15. During hospital stay, I was treated with IV Vancomycin twice per day. That helped quite a bit to reduce rash and swelling but it remains at a mild level. I am currently Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. I took the first dose of the oral med at the hospital on the day of discharge.

                                                ?Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA? About a week after my first dose (only immediate side effect, about 12 hours after shot, was stiff left arm/shoulder for about 3 days), I had the WORST genital herpes attack that I&#39;ve had in literally 40 years, with extremely swollen labia, excessively &#34;weeping&#34; sores, intense itching and pain. The shot was the only variable in my routine health and healthcare to which I can attribute this; the herpes attack finally began to heal, but then repeated itself, not as bad as the first one. During this time I have been taking Valcyclovir and Acyclovir cream, prescribed by OB/GYN. A few days into the initial herpes attack, my hands and face swelled and broke out in a case of (probably) dermatitis (which I&#39;ve had once or twice in the last 2 years), covering my arms, legs, hands, somewhat belly and back, with itchy hives which are still healing. Was prescribed by dermatologist Hydroxyzine HCL 10 MG 3x/day &#43; Triamcinolone Acetonide lotion USP 0.025% topical ointment, which are helping to relieve itching.

I had itching and developed a 3&#34; x 2&#34; oval shaped red area near the site of the vaccine (upper left arm).  It is not too bothersome physically, but it does worry me mentally.  I also had some left armpit tenderness a couple days after the vaccine, which lasted about 3 days, but that has subsided.

This was  accompanied by a prickling sensations.  I got a sore inside my right nostril and a cold sore on right upper lip.  The mottling and vein prominence continue intermittently still.  Improving but not resolved entirely. Along with this, my eyes became intermittently  itchy as if I had an allergic irritation. This has also completely resolved.  I spoke with a relative who is a physician  and he felt that I may have had a hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis reaction.

                                                This was second shot.  No reaction after first shot that I recall except sore arm for a couple days. This time had low grade fever (100.1), body aches, sore neck, joint aches in hands, minor headache, chills from fever.  Also injection site redness, which extended out for a few inches around the injection site itself.  This lasted about 3 or 4 days and was warm to the touch.  The fever etc. only lasted the one day (day after injection) and by day three I was fine.  Was not servere enough to keep me from working etc., but I did go to bed early that night.

Like needles being stuck on my arm, the next day Saturday, i had most severe headache and chills, Mild fever and couldn&#39;t get out of the bed.  Just subsided on Sunday evening. But it is still very sore and a little swelling at the injection site. Dr. was called and told me to take Aleve and ice pack it.

                                                About 6 PM the day I received the vaccine, the arm started to become extremely sore. It was achy feeling and it radiated down to my wrist. This lasted until Sunday and it started to fade. Today it is just some soreness left at the injection site. I was taking OTC Acetaminophen 500MG between 100 MG for pain. It was difficult to sleep due to the pain. I was also putting cool compresses on it.  The pain worse when I was trying to clean my car and shovel the snow. However the cold compress and stretching did help with some of the pain. I also felt agitated for different periods times after vaccination, I felt like my hormones were out of whack and I wanted to &#34;bite someone&#39;s head off&#34; this lasted for about an 1 hour or so. I also had mild headaches.

It appears the name for that is now, Covid arm.  Today, 2/23/2021, the redness is fading and it is only slightly itchy.    Very mild tenderness when I touch it.  Checked my temp over the last few days and it was in the normal range 97.4-97.9 (for me).

I was sent to the emergency room where I was given an injection of Decadron and Pepcid and sent home with a prescription to take Prednisone for four days and Pepcid twice a day for 7 days.  The prickling decreased a little but has returned with tingling in the face, feet, legs and arms.

                                                On day 3 after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine I experienced soreness, redness, and swelling 3&#34; below the injection site. I sought medical treatment. I was diagnosed with cellulitis which the PA attributed to the injection. I was prescribed 5 days of Bactrim (800mg/160 mg) and Benadryl. If after 5 days the symptoms are not resolved or if the cellulitis site dramatically increases in size, I am to seek additional medical attention.

                                                starting February 5, I had mild swelling in the entire left leg treated with ice and anti-inflammatories. There was no redness, swelling, or pain at injection site. Symptoms seemed to be slowly subsiding. However, Thursday 2/11/21, I had a small patch of itchy, (but not painful) red rash on back of left thigh. By Thursday evening it had doubled in size. Friday am (2/12/21) it was a little bigger still. Then by Friday after work, my entire left leg was moderate to severely swollen and the rash covered a large part of the back of right thigh and was beginning to spread to the back of left calf.  Friday evening, I visited Urgent Care. The doctor there was concerned about a a possible DVT and sent me to the ER. At ER, an ultrasound revealed no DVT. At no time did I have a fever. TheER doctor admitted me to the hospital where I remained until the afternoon of Monday, February 15. During hospital stay, I was treated with IV Vancomycin twice per day.  That helped quite a bit to reduce rash and swelling but it remains at a mild level. I am currently Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. I took the first dose of the oral med at the hospital on the day of discharge.

                                                One week and 1 day after the vaccination  my arm started to itch at the injection side.  I thought I might have gotten a bug bite.  When I awoke the next morning (Jan. 14) it was still itching and I had a large area which is reddened and bumpy.  It does not hurt.  I went to our local Health Department and had a nurse take a look and she and another nurse had not seen this reaction before but indicated I should report it to you.  It  is approximately 3 inches long and 2 inches wide.  They also advised me to take Benadryl and Ibuprofen.

                                                While driving home after leaving facility 15 minutes after shot, I started having an increased heart rate.  Once home, the rapid heart rate continued and I noticed throat swallowing was getting a little tighter.  I started drinking water and just breathed normally sitting down.  I went to a mirror to see if I could see any swelling of my face and noticed my neck right under my chin was red about half way down.  My chest seemed fine.  I continued to just sit &amp; drink water and soon the heart rate was getting back to normal.  I noticed the redness on my neck was getting lighter also.  I looked at my watch and it had been a little over an hour since my vaccination.  I did not seek treatment, nor have I called my doctor.  There have been no more adverse reactions.

On 02-Jan-2021, a few hours prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   A few hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient started to feel itching at the injection site. Later that same night, she developed redness and the injection site became hard and a little tender. The following day the reaction was worse and lasted for four days By 06-Jan-2021 the reaction was gone but appeared again and lasted until 11-Jan-2021. She also mentioned that the needle used for the injection was 25-gauge needle so she believed she may have received the vaccine subcutaneously.   Treatment for the events included hydrocortisone cream.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.   The outcomes of the event, might have received the vaccine subcutaneously, was resolved on 02 Jan 2021.

I staring applying 1% hydrocortisone cream on the affected area and taking Benadryl 25mg tablets. The pruiritus started to lessen however the erythema and edema did not decrease so I contacted my primary care provider. She referred me to an allergist who I saw via telehealth on 1/25/21. By that time the pruiritus, erythema, and edema was almost gone however I did show her a picture when the reaction was at its most severe state. As of today, it is still present but continues to resolve. My allergist discussed the reported incidence of this reaction, informed me that it did not contraindicate me from receiving the 2nd dose, and that this reaction may or may not occur again.

The following Saturday 1/30 the same area turned red again but this time very itchy and again swollen and soar.

The confusions is because it?s the same arm after the vaccine was administered, so what else could it be from.

I was still freezing.  Got up to go to the bathroom as I normally do.  While sitting on the toilet, I started shaking violently - not just regular shivers.  This was scary.  Violent jerking from the waist up - head, arms, torso.  I could not control it.  Eventually it stopped.  I put on warmer clothes and climbed back into bed.  Eventually I warmed up and went to sleep.  Other minor side effects were same as the first vaccine - sore and tender around the injection sight and slight headache.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

Started as a few red pimples but became red all over and swollen (possible hives?). Later in evening swollen lymph node (about 1)2 inch diameter) under chin near left ear. Felt very tender. Lymph node swelling reduced by next morning. Rash at injection remained. Has diminished in color but is still pink thru today 02/22/2021 and no more itch.  Took no action at all. Notified primary care physician Thurs 02/18/2021. Note that on Friday 02/12/2021 (prior to rash appearing) started prescription prilosec 40 mg 1 per day. Continued this thru Thurs 02/18/2021.  Discontinued prilosec after speaking with primary care physician. Don&#39;t know if this had anything to do with reaction.

Much like an allergic reaction to poison ivy. I cannot pinpoint to any other change in diet, laundry detergent, soap, etc.  I am treating with Benadryl and cortizone cream but some whelps are still  itchy 2 days later.  I am better but not completely gone.

I took a Benadryl to stop the hives progression. I had to take antihistimes for several days.  The hives never popped up so the meds helped.  My head felt bruised and heated as if the blood was pumping around my skull.  The headaches are still intermittent 6 days later. I did not seek medical care.

By the end of the day, the soreness in my arm radiated up into the left side of my neck.  I applied a heating pad, took a warm bath and went to bed early.  This morning, my neck is a little better but the arm is more sore and the red area has gotten larger and is swollen.  The pain med-to-mild and does not restrict range of motion or use of my arm.  No distinct pattern or broken skin.

Over next 36 hours fever was between 100-102. Nausea began 48 hours after injection.  It is now Tuesday, almost 4 days since injection and am still dizzy and weak.  Fever stopped yesterday and only light headache today.   My husband also had all my symptoms except a much lower fever.  We are wondering if we could have got a bad batch???  They said to expect 1-2 days of mild discomfort.  This was like the worst flu I&#39;ve ever had.

The first reaction was a sore arm at the injection site.  The second continues to be a rash at the injection site, which started 6 days after the injection and has not subsided.  It changes in visual characteristic but itches fairly consistently.  I have taken acetaminophen for the discomfort, and some migraine specific medication (rizatriptan) for the headaches.

                                                The volunteer chose a landing mark for the needle which when stuck into my shoulder joint area, hit something, so he immediately withdrew that needle.  He then took a new second needle and chose a 2nd landing mark that was close to the first needle &#34;stick&#34; and delivered the vaccine.  I felt immediate burning  and that continued for much of the day.   The burning proceeded into intense pain.  I returned to the Senior Center at 7:30 a.m. the next morning and reported the error the volunteer made and showed the head nurse the bruise that was high - at my upper arm - and nearly on my shoulder.  The head nurse said it was &#34;high.&#34;   She asked me what I wanted her to do.  I responded that she should report the error and I would like it documented, as I was now afraid I might have endured a shoulder/joint injury.  I also called the health department and the Covid-19 Help Line  and reported the error.  I had two days of intense pain, where I could not physically, not just the excruciating pain, lift my arm.  I emailed an Orthopaedic doctor who specialized in shoulders and made an emergency apmt with him.  I also made an apmt with my primary.  My ortho doctor is treating me for SIVRA, I am on anti-inflammatories, I am having physical therapy on my left shoulder, as there is constant pain.  I am scheduled for return visits to my orthopaedic doctor and this appears to be a concern as far as damage, time course and outcome.  I hope the head nurse DID report the injury to my shoulder area.  She promised to record the event in &#34;my file,&#34;

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

This produced a red blotchy spot.  Today it is twice the size of yesterday.  I did apply moisturizing cream to the site yesterday morning prior to it being red.

I took Ibuprofen, rested, had lots of liquids, and was fine the day after (01/01/2021) No other symptoms until exactly one week later (01/06/2021). I noticed the injection site on my left arm was itching and a bit sore. A 5&#34;x3&#34; red rash appeared at injection site. I took one Acetaminophen PM that night. The red rash is still there. These appear to be minor reactions but the red rash is never one I have had before with any vaccinations. It seems strange it didn&#39;t appear until a week later. No difference in skin lotion I have used. I wanted to report effects for data collection purposes since it is a new/emergency vaccine.

                                                No symptoms until 1 week after vaccine received.  On 1/6/2020 at 8 pm, I noticed a nickel-size raised area at injection site. It was tender, itchy and moderately hard to the touch.  No visible rash.  Right upper arm appeared slightly swollen.   It continued to increase in size, tenderness and itchiness for approximately 48 hours.  On 1/8/2020 at approx 8 pm I noticed it was then a quarter-sized raised area at the injection site,  It was more tender, itchy and hard than it had been.  That was the worst it became.  By the next morning, 1/9/2020, symptoms were significantly decreased.  Currently, 1/9/2020 7:08 pm, the area is no longer visibly raised, tender or itchy. However, I can still feel a very slightly firm dime-sized area at the injection site.   No fever, breathing problems or other side effects noted since getting the vaccine.

On day 9, in the morning I noticed redness, heat, and itching at vaccination site-for an area of about 4&#34; long and 2&#34; wide. Today, the area is slightly less reddened but still very itchy. I have no other signs or symptoms. I was responding daily to V-Safe check ins but the the last text that I received from them was on Wednesday, January 6. I have not been able to contact them to report the change in my signs and symptoms since this reaction has occured after their check-ins with me, stopped. I am a nurse and feel it is improtant for you to know all reactions which I why I am contacting you. I could not find another site or place to report this.  Thank you!

                                                I woke up this morning with shoulder pain believing I slept wrong on it until I felt my left arm and felt this huge lump wondering how I grew a muscle overnight.  It was definitely swollen and some redness too. I took my temperature and had no fever. Called my doctor&#39;s office to report my findings. Was instructed to apply a cold ice pack on it and take ibuprofen and to contact you with my event. I did not need to visit the office and continuing to ice pack my arm and ibuprofen.  As of 3:41 pm CST it is still swollen.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine: My left arm was very sore starting in the evening of 1/6/2021. This soreness got worse over the next 2 days and then tapered off over the weekend.  On 1/11/2021, I started having pain in my left axillary region.  This pain increased into 1/12/2021.  Also, on 1/12, my left upper arm started hurting.  On 1/13, I still had pain in my left axillary region, and thespian in my left upper arm worsened.  Also, on 1/13 my left upper arm started itching.  Around 5pm on 1/13, I had a chance to look at my left upper arm and there was a large reddened area to my left upper arm which included the vaccine injection site.  This area was warm to touch.  About 5:30pm, I took 25mg of Benadryl.  I took another 25mg Benadryl at 11pm.  This morning (1/14), the redness is fading to the area on my left upper arm though itching remains.  There is slight pain to the area.  The pain to the left axillary region is much better-barely noticeable.  I reported this event to County Health Department and to my primary physician.

Then on day 7 post immunization I developed a reaction at the injection site.  There was a large (3 inch by 2 inch) raised reddish/pink area that was hard to the touch and warm.  It itched slightly.  It lasted 3 days and now it is starting to resolve.

                                                Got slightly dizzy as I stood up. Went to sit in observation room.  My heart was beating very fast for about 8 minutes.  Felt a tightness in my chest and had a slight bit of difficulty breathing.  Did not want to tell the monitors.  Afraid to go to a hospital with COVID.  My left hand turned blue and got cold and tingly.  That lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  So did the trouble breathing.  All subsided in 15 minutes.  Went home and took an antihistamine.  Had a light rash on my body.  Consulted with PCP and cardiologist.  They seem clueless.  We all agreed that i need the second dose but what is the antidote.  Cardiologist gave me a beta-blocker to take before the dose but these symptoms all appeared on the severe allergic reaction list.  The heart pounding was the most pronounced symptom.  What do I do?

On day four, more appeared and progressed rapidly to entire trunk, arms, face and legs.  and throat felt tight.  Urgent Care Center gave me two injections: Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate, and Diphenhydramine.  Was observed for 40 minutes.  Whelps and rash had not resolved, so doctor had me begin taking Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours x 24 hours.  Rash began to resolve approximately 10 hours afte treatment initiation.  Continuing to resolve.

The next day the redness turned triangular shape and larger than 2 inches, then it stayed triangular shape but got about 4 inches.  It lasted about 5-6 days and then went away.

                                                I woke up today, 1/22/2021, with an extremely itchy left arm. I also woke up 1 hour after the alarm went off, and was still lethargic. The source of the itch is a 1.5&#34; rash just below the vaccination site on my left arm.  The rash appears over a hard or swollen bump that is the same size as the rash.   I may also have a rash on my left neck because it itches, but I can&#39;t see or feel it.

Throughput the evening, the tingling sensation progressed up the left side of my neck and my ear.  My ear felt similar s to Novacaine wearing off after a dental visit. During the night my throat got a similar sensation and created the need to try coughing it out. By 24 hours after the injection I was tired, with sore joints and muscle aches. By 36 hours I was still sleeping it off and at 48 hours I feel pretty well back to normal.

                                                Mild cellulitis; Headache; Sore arm; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced a sore arm, headache, and mild cellulitis.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included calcium and memantine hydrochloride.   On 28 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had a sore arm for 2-3 days. She was worried that she would get a headache so she took ibuprofen.   On 03 Jan 2021, the patient had a low-grade headache but it was not a migraine. She took acetaminophen and ibuprofen but it did not help.   On 04 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s arm was a bit sore.   On 05 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s headache went away but she felt she had mild cellulitis. Her arm felt a little bit warm at the injection site, it was also swollen and red. These symptoms persisted for about 2 days and then began to get better. Treatment for the events included ibuprofen, acetaminophen and icing.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event, mild cellulitis, was considered resolving. The event, headache, was resolved on 05 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, sore arm, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67year old, female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of cellulitis, and non-serious expected event of pain in extremity and headache. The event of pain in extremity occurred same day after first dose mRNA-1273 (Lot# 026L20A) administration. The event of headache occurred after 7 days and cellulitis occurred 9 days after mRNA-1273 (Lot# 026L20A) administration. The subject&#39;s concomitant medication included calcium and Biomentin. The treatment medications were included Tylenol, Advil and icing. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                When my fingers touched something cold they would feel weird and lose their color. The first time (1/21) was minor (one finger) and the second time was (1/23) and all the tips of my fingers of my right hand turned colorless when I touched something cold. 1/24 my toes tingled when I walked and happens when I go for a walk. The finger symptom seems to be diminishing. I have never had either of these things happen before I had the Moderna vaccine. My doctor told me not to have the second dose which is due on 1/30/2021.

While driving home my face became warm, after arriving home face/cheeks extremely red/flushed.  Have a picture taken at 3:54 for documentation. Not sure if from anxiety, but felt jaw tightness and a thick tongue.  No itching, swallowing problems etc.   lasted approximately 15 minutes. By 4:57 pm redness had faded.   Picture documentation. 9:15 pm had right ear pain and mild reddened of right cheek.   Picture documentation.

Then 8 days after vaccine I developed a rash about 2 1/2 inches high by 3 inches wide about an inch or so below the injection site on left arm.  The rash is itchy and a little warm to touch.   Contacted allergy Dr. and was told to take an allergy pill.  Am also using cortisone cream.  Rash is a little better after about 24 hours but still there.  Today is 10 days after receiving the vaccine.

On the surface of the skin, the periphery of that area has a shape of an uneven interrupted pink line. That pink line resembles a distorted ellipse of 5-6 cm x 3-4 cm. The inside area of the &#34;ellipse&#34; is also pink but of lesser intensity than the borderline. The surface of that area has a noticeably higher temperature than the corresponding area on the right arm. The overall temperature of the body is normal.

Occasional tingling, angioderma around mouth. Disssapated after Benadryl.  Rash is gradually fading and requires less Benadryl to keep in check.  Had similar reaction to Shrinyx vaccine 2 years ago.  Rash lasted 1-2 weeks without Benadryl treatment.

On Jan 27th (7 days following vaccination) a large (2.5&#34; X 4&#34;) red area formed around the injection site on my arm and it began to ache and itch. I also had diarrhea which began in the middle of the night (2 am on Jan 28), with a total of 3 episodes over 3 hours. That day I was very tired, experienced intestinal upset  (w/ very small episodes of diarrhea) and my arm began to really ache and the swollen area became rather firm and hot. The intestinal episode is over but the hot red welt continues as of this report. Diarrhea is not a common condition for me.

                                                I received the 1st shot of the Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine on 1/23/21 at the Pharmacy. Three days later I started experiencing sharp abdominal cramps with gas that I couldn&#39;t expel and abdominal bloating. I am still experiencing this 6 days later from when it started. I feel better when laying down but when I stand up I have this really heavy feeling in my lower abdomen. I also experience abdominal cramps not long after eating. I am not constipated. In fact, I&#39;ve been having a lot more bowel movements which is not normal for me. Also, on Sunday, 1/31, eight days after injection, I developed a red patch that was very warm on my left arm where I received the injection and a headache. The red patch is still there. I&#39;m concerned about this and wonder if this may be related to one of the ingredients in the vaccine, i.e., polyethylene glycol.  I have reported this to my M.D. this morning and they are asking me to come in.

Took one antihistamine--chlorpheniramine. Began to feel chills 29 hours after injection. 36 hours after injection, awakened when both arms and legs felt numb. Very thirsty, &#39;cotton mouth&#39;. Drank water. Will take another chlorpheniramine.

                                                On Jan . 19, Exactly one week after vaccine (part 1)  vaccine site developed a nickel size red area and about 1 1/2 inch above vaccine site a 2 inch red, hot, itchy patch appeared on my right shoulder. .  There had been no discoloration prior to this . I applied a clean cold wet washcloth to shoulder  area. For about an hour. That stopped itch. Next morning area still looked and felt the same-red, hot, itchy. I again applied clean cold washcloth to shoulder area. For about 30 minutes.  Then applied an over counter cream ( hydrocortisone 1% plus) just to shoulder area.  Used the cream again just before bed that Wednesday night and again Thursday night, only on shoulder. Itching stopped and did not resume. Redness and heat on rash faded each day until completely gone by Sunday January 24th., total of 6 days.

Contacted PCP, she suggested I see an allergist to be safe, met with Dr. on 2/18/21, he prescribed a cortisone cream to use immediateley.  He also prescribed prednisone to use after second vaccine if reaction was worse, and an epinephrine auto-injector in case of severe reaction.  He also suggested switching arms.  Redness and itch have finally faded to almost nothing as of 2/22/21.

Her arm felt warm, and realized it was the area where she got the vaccine.  She put some lotion on it, and just kept watching it and did not go away.  The hand started feeling funny, different feeling to it.  The redness was trying to travel underneath the arm and around it.   She took an allergy pill for it, which helped the itching at first, but now it&#39;s localized more to the area of the vaccine.  She does have an appointment today with her doctor.  She also took some Advil but going to wait to see what the doctor tells her to do.

On 2/16/21 noticed a red hive like rash at the injection site that extended down to the  inside of my arm. No bumps, not itching,  just a red patch about the size of a half of chicken breast.  Applied Triamcinolone cream to the site. Saw Dr. on 2/17/21  and she said to monitor and apply the Triamcinolone cream.  If it worsened we may treat it as a skin infection.  The redness  lessened over the next few days and was gone by 2/21/21

He said I should not take the 2nd dose, but to follow the advice of Moderna and CDC re: that decision.

Otherwise, I have not had any other adverse side affects since receiving the injection.

On 2/19//2021 I also experienced repeat generalized symptoms: including repeat headaches. body aches &amp; extreme fatigue since 2/19/21 including today, which is  2/23/2021. I did not have the pronounced local reaction at the vaccination site on my L arm initially after the vaccination. When I looked up the delayed reaction online I realized some others have experienced this delayed reaction.

                                                I received my Covid-19 Moderna vaccine on February 12. Soon afterward, the pharmacy called and told me that they had accidently given me a double dose. They reported it to my primary care physician and both the pharmacy and my doctor stayed in close contact with me to monitor my health. I had the usual sore arm, a headache, and a little achy that evening, but nothing major. I noticed the next day that I had a hard lump about 3.5 inches below where my shot was given (not directly below, more toward the inside of my arm.) A small rash begin to develop, but after a few days the rash was gone, but the lump remained. Twelve days after my shot, the lump became very red and hot. The rash appeared again and basically moved up my arm. I kept putting a cortisone itch cream on it, but it was very uncomfortable. Two days after the rash appeared I became quite sick with what it felt like side effects ? chills that included violent shaking and temperature that reached 100.5. I had that for about 24 hours. Now the lump on my arm is gone, I no longer have rash, and my temperature is back to normal. I feel tired today, but probably because of the previous day?s temps and chills. I find it interesting that 2 weeks after my shot I would have those kind of reactions (unless this had nothing to do with the shot?)  I thought you might want to have this data, as it is an interesting side effect. My doctor wasn?t sure how to explain it either. I would be interested to see if others that might have gotten an overdose of the shot experienced anything similar.

My arm is weak and cannot raise, lift or rotate it above the elbow.  Very difficult to maintain sleep with a throbbing arm. I have been taking Alleve and it helps but the pain is still there just milder. Muscles are not sore but something is aching deep in bone/joints. I went to the Kinesiologist who told me the rotor cuff is the issue. He did an pressure point &#34;adjustment&#34; and the pain subsided for a day or two and now I&#39;m back to being in pain during any level of movement again.  I believe that my injection was given too high in my shoulder and caused SIRVA. I even took a picture of where the injection site was given.  If needed I can provide it to you.

The arm was also distinctly warm to the touch and tender.  During the first evening, I experienced chills and presumed fever that responded to 400 mg of Ibuprofen.  I experienced some nausea, loss of appetite, and malaise over the next three to four days after injection.

It was hot and tender. Size extended by Day 11 slightly with the  two squares becoming a more rounded single site. I took some Benedryl at that time about 4pm and then took Acetominophen and Famotidine at bedtime.

                                                Began experiencing itchy ankles on Thursday, 1/7/21, afternoon.  Itching got worse overnight and awoke to find numerous raised red spots over my legs, thighs, and lower back. Spots became more numerous and pronounced through Friday, 1/8/21, and itching became nearly unbearable causing me to make deep scratches on the bac of my legs. Spots continued to spread and become more pronounced throughout the weekend. There have been no other notable symptoms. The itchiness is horrible and only occasionally becomes bearable for a short time - usually after taking Benadryl at bedtime.

Now I have some bruise in my face, mainly around my left eye. Feeling a little dizzy,  I am in quarantine I and my husband are staying home all the time. I have my doctor scheduled for next Thursday.

The inside of my upper lip on the left side also became very sore.  And my inner labia on the left side became very sore and itchy.  On 01/18, I examined those areas and found a large blistered area on my inner lip.  On 01/19, in addition to the red, painful area on my inner labia, there were multiple blisters. I have a history of HSV-1 in the genitals. I take Valtrex 500 mg daily. I had an appointment with my GYN?s NP on 1/20.  They ordered Valtrex 1 GM for 5 days, and to repeat that when I get my second dose, which is scheduled for 2/7/21. The blisters are now resolving.

                                                I began experiencing itching at the injection site day 6 post vaccination, which I assumed was not unexpected. However, I subsequently began experiencing intense itching at night first on my left forearm and anterior left thigh and the next night on both anterior thighs, at which time  I also noted welts and redness over the surface as well. Both nights I took Benadryl to good effect and have not noticed itching or rash during the daytime.

Then about a week later, it started to get red again with a hardness.  It also was itchy.  It was not sore at all.   I have taken Benedryl and Benedryl cream.  It is not itchy now and the hardness is gone.  It is about 2-3 inches in diameter.

                                                One week after taking the vaccine I developed significant swelling of the upper left arm at the vaccination site that gradually got worse as the day progressed. I also experienced a headache and a severe spike in blood pressure in the afternoon, which led me to think that my reaction might be severe. As a result I went to the local ER where they decided to keep me overnight for observation. The symtoms did not get worse, but I was given steroids and peptid intravenously, as well as Benadryl to counteract the swelling. Today, Jan. 28, I continue to have some swelling in the left arm, as well as redness.

About the 3rd day it covered the top of my arm but the middle was now lighter than the perimeter.   There was no pain or itching.  The rash is still present so I cannot answer 19 and 20.  I am assuming it will go away.

                                                After receiving the shot at 9:00 a.m., at 6:00 p.m. I started to feel very tired and as if I was getting a fever.  By 9:00 p.m. I was shaking from chills (despite being bundled up under a blanket), so I took my temperature -- it was 100.5 degrees orally.  My normal temperature on that thermometer is 97.6 degrees.   That night, I kept waking up every two hours or so and was very uncomfortable.  THe next day I felt very lethargic -- unable to do anything other than make myself something to eat.  I took two naps, one in the morning, and the other in the afternoon (that was about two hours).  I felt slightly better by around 8 p.m.  That night I slept somewhat better and felt myself break into a sweat during the night -- so I guess that is when the fever broke.  The next day (today) my temperature was back to normal and I feel okay.  Throughout the now three days, the arm where I got the shot was painful, but gets less so each day.

Day 6 ( Feb 18, 2021) I started to have a lot of muscular aches and the injection site started to get red and swollen.  I had fever and chills from the 18th through the 20th  as well as a swollen arm and a lot of redness in the arm and minor itching. The red area on my arm was a patch about 4 inches wide and 6 inches long. The swelling was confined to the injection site and was raised up in a circle about 2 inches in diameter. My fever during this time was at 99 degrees.  Today is Feb 22 and most of my symptoms are gone, just minor redness and itching at injection site. I was just surprised that my symptoms didn?t show up until about 6 days after the vaccination.. Everything I have read suggested they could appear within 48 hours of the injection.

The rash was approximately 3 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. A small welt was also present. I applied a topical steroid ointment which relieved the itchiness. The rash resolved after 3 days.

It  was there daily , appeared hot and the reddened area appeared to widen.  The area was more itchy than painful. I looked for similar symptoms/side effects on the internet and found photos of &#34;covid arm&#34; that resembled mine.  I eventually applied some topoical benadryl around the 15 February which by this time was looking better-less redness and area.  Back to normal by February 16th.

Most people say they don&#39;t even feel it, but I definitely felt the needle  go in and then felt the fluid go in.  By late afternoon, my left arm was very sore .  By  evening, I  couldn&#39;t lift my arm at all  due to pain in  that muscle at the top of my shoulder.  I think by that night but perhaps by the next morning I still couldn&#39;t lift my arm and the pain had gone into my neck on the left side.  After about 36 hrs, it started getting better but it was extremely sore for at least 4 days.   I still have some residual pain in my left arm and the base of my neck on that side.     About 4 days ago, I noticed  a round bruise about the size of a quarter about 1.5 inches away from where I think the shot was administered.  I am not aware of anything that might have caused it, but Im pretty sure it wasn&#39;t where the shot  was administered.  It seems to be growing a bit from when I first noticed it.

ON 2/6/2021 received first vaccine injection.  within 3 minutes a light headache started.  That evening, rash and itching on right fore-arm and under chin. took benedryl. Woke at 3:30 am on 2/7 not feeling well and left arm very sore and could not touch.  6:30 am - chills with severe body shaking and 101 temp.  7:30 am 102.2  took tylenot 8 hr 650 mg. Oxygen at 96, heart rate at 76 and BP 117/68. 8:00 am 101.9 temp. 10 am 100.6 temp. 1:30 pm 102.9 temp. 2:00 pm 103.3  Took Tylenol, extra strength 2 tabs. 8:30 pm used inhaler due to chest pains  101.3 temp. took benedryl.  Oxygennn @98  HR-82 BP 145/77.  11.00 pm 103.3 temp. took 2 tylenol.  Mon 8:00 Monday am continued/ 100.2 temp  oxygen 97  HR-70; 99.2 temp  BP 110/71.  7 pm. took Benedryl for congestion.   Quit taking stats.  Fatigue and rest took play at this point.  Since then have had intermittent low grade fever in 99.2 to 99.9.  Same with headache and extreme fatigue.  Have high risk husband that I take care of .  He had his first vaccine at same time.  No side effect at all.  I am scheduled for 2nd vaccine on March 6th.  I am very apprehensive about taking it with this reaction.  Please advise/recommend if I should proceed.  My PCP stated that these reactions were evidence the vaccine is working.  Is this because I had the virus???  Both the virus and vaccine have been really hard on me.  I am usually a very active person and since August, I have been struggling with fatigue.  First time in life.   Thank you.

About 3-4 inches in size.  Two days later, today, it is still there.  I have since learned that this has a name:  &#34;Covid arm&#34;.  And that it is known only to occur with the Moderna vaccine, and more common in women than men.  It is quite itchy, warm to the touch.  I have been applying ice and using OTC anti-itch cream.

She had a goosebump rash all over prior to vaccination and denied any allergies prior to this event.  After vaccination (not certain of time frame) she developed a goosebump, red dot, hot, itchy, spot rash all over legs and arms.  Her dermatologist biopsy confirmed a drug eruption.  She does use an ice pack for relief and was prescribed prednisone.  My final recommendation was to stop taking Miralax and report all of this to primary care MD.  Also, recommended she discuss the second vaccine with both the dermatologist and PCP.  At first patient denied having and allergic type symptoms to Miralax (ex. diarrhea and cramping).  She only divulged having the goosebump rash (not as bad) prior to vaccination at the end of our conversation.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Patient presented to ED on 3/14/21 with new onset of inability to walk. Recalls not feeling well on 3/4/21 after receiving her COVID-19 vaccine (1st dose) on 2/21/21.  She began to experience aching over the anterior thigh on the following day that progressed to involve the posterior lower extremity and forearms by Saturday, 3/6/21.  She also began to experience numbness and tingling in the feet and fingers at that time.  The sensory symptoms persisted over the following days in association with lower extremity weakness that culminated in a fall at home on Thursday, 3/11/21.  She was unable to walk without assistance at the time of her presentation.  Initial examination in the ED revealed borderline antigravity lower extremity strength and absent lower extremity reflexes.  A lumbar puncture performed on 3/14/21 revealed protein  218.1, glucose  76, WBC  8, and RBC 1. She was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome and received her initial dose of IVIG that evening. She has noted some interval improvement in lower extremity muscle strength since her admission to the hospital.  The pain that she had been experiencing is less intense, though she is still prone to experience discomfort if she remains in the same position too long.  She is continuing to experience tingling in the feet and fingers.  She is not experiencing any shortness of breath or difficulty with chewing/swallowing.  She is not experiencing any urinary bladder dysfunction.  She is experiencing constipation.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

After a few hours it went away on its own. On 1/13/2021  started out in the morning with itching on area where shot was given. Then a rash in that same area. Then by the afternoon my arm swelled up covering a large area around where shot was given. It was hard like a knot. Today, 1/14/2021 it is still itching, red around swollen area. Swollen area is not as large as yesterday.

                                                1 week after the injection I noticed a red sometimes itchy slightly raised area about 1 inch in diameter.  It gradually got larger and on 1/11/2021 the size increased to 2.5 inches in diameter . On 1/14 or 1/15/2021 it spread to the size of 4.5 inches in diameter. The next few days the are began to fade.

When I got home from work  on 1.19.2021 I noticed a large red  patch which was hot to the touch.  During the day my arm where I received the injection became very itchy.  During the day I also was extremely tired and had developed a headache and felt like I may be getting a cold.  I also had a neckache.  I still have those symptoms.   I received my vaccine on 1.06.2021.

                                                One week after receiving my COVID 19 vaccine I developed a red itchy area around the injection site (6 in. by 3 in. oval.  I called the injection site facility and they told me to draw a line around the redness, take Benadryl and watch for worsening.  I took 2 Benadryl that day. On day 2 (1-20-21) the redness had not increaed so I used 1 Benadryl and then Benadryl cream. On day 3 (1-21-21) the redness was still there so I took 3 Benedryl throughout the day and the redness faded.  The evening of the third day I developed a butterfly redness on my face after drinking wine which is not a normal reaction for me and took a Benadryl tablet.  1-22-21  Redness mostly gone but still a little itchy.

It was approximately 6 in long and 3 in. wide in an oval shape.  I called the health care facility where I received the vaccine and was told to draw a line around the site, take Benadryl and watch for worsening.   I took two Benadryl tablets that day.  The site did not increase in size so I used only one Benadryl tablet on 1-20-21 and Benadryl cream on the site.  The redness did not subside until 1-21-21 when I used 3 Benadryl tablets throughout the day.  The redness is fairly faint on 1-22-21 but still itches when rubbed.  The evening of 1-21-21 I develop a butterfly redness on my face in the evening following a glass of wine which is not usual for me.  Not sure if it is related.

On Thursday, January 21 found arm starting to ache with large lump, and a great deal of swelling. Friday, January 22 had large red rash 3 inches in diameter, which became larger hour by hour. Saw my primary physicia and she was unsure what was happening. We agreed to monitor the arm and call if it got worse or I had other symptoms. The following two days found the red rash becoming more of a bulls eye. The outer ring was red with the inner bulls eye brown, same coloring as a birthmark. The upper arm continues to ache, but swelling is down and today, Monday, January 25, it is still discolored, but brown rather than red.

                                                Had slight swelling, rash &amp; feeling of being flushed first three days after receiving the vaccine. On Thursday, January 21 found arm starting to ache with large lump, and a great deal of swelling. Friday, January 22 had large red rash 3 inches in diameter, which became larger hour by hour. Saw my primary physician and she was unsure what was happening. We agreed to monitor the arm and call if it got worse or I had other symptoms. The following two days found the red rash becoming more of a bulls eye. The outer ring was red with the inner bulls eye brown, same coloring as a birthmark. The upper arm continues to ache, but swelling is down and today, Monday, January 25, it is still discolored, but brown rather than red.

                                                I received the injection around 2:30 I felt fine. It did not hurt going in. I stopped by a restaurant to get some take out and must of started feeling disorientated and completely forgot I had this folder with the VSAFE information. I started feeling chills all over my body, I kept taking my temperature it was 95.7, I started having a headache top of my head, the temporal, the back of my neck. They were all over the place. I went to bed and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It was like my brain was going crazy, it wasn&#39;t like an anxious feeling. I finally feel asleep around 4am and kept waking up remembering fragments of valid dreams. The dreams were fragment with such dread and anxiety in them.  It was like a huge wave of depression and anxiety. By about 9am I was fully awake, but my body hurt, my muscles ached I felt fatigued. The chills and headaches were through. I was still having weird racing thoughts. About 10pm it all went away and I slept fine and woke up the next morning and I was fine. My arm is still sore at the injection site but all the other symptoms went away.    Saturday morning I was talking with a friend on the phone, and she reminded me of the folder I received the folder. I completely forgot about this folder. I found this folder later that day and then I tried to access VSAFE. It made me realize how disorientated I was.

It itched and I refrained from scratching, put up with it for a couple days, but finally got so annoyed by it I looked at the site and saw a large angry red area around the site, covering much of my upper arm.  I put Neosporin on it to try to take out the sting, and the next two days I put on hydrocortisone cream, which seems to take most of the sting away.  But the area of red on my upper arm has become even larger now at the 11th day after vaccination.  I presume I must have some reaction to a component of the vaccine that is causing a very localized topical reaction.  I have never had a reaction to any vaccination before in my life aside from muscular soreness.

                                                Not quite 2 weeks since my vaccination I developed a slight rash, redness and some swelling in my upper left arm. I think slightly below where I received the shot. Not sure if it had to do with vaccination. Just letting you know.

                                                A week after vaccine felt a pain on her arm, no redness. Had lumps on the arm initially did compressions and no reaction.  Pain is similar to shingles pain.  When she works on it it comes down but it&#39;s still there.  Pain is tolerable but is annoying due to it lingering.  Still has the discomfort today.

I noticed an itch on 1/24/21 @ night and again the next morning and upon close inspection found the reddened oval shape that was warm and swollen.  It continues today on 1/27/21. I am not exhibiting any signs of anaphylaxis.  My concern is whether is is safe form me to receive the second Moderna vaccine on February 9th.

Started with severe chills, body shaking, achy all over, head felt like it was going to implode, started to sweat and felt flushed.  Woke up my spouse to get me something to take for headache, etc.  Later that morning could hard lift the Arm, felt a golf ball size lump at injection site and warm to the touch.

                                                I am concerned they injected  high, above the muscle.  They had trouble getting the injection in, it burned a lot, she kept asking me to relax my muscle (which was relaxed) and when I took the Band-Aid off it looked high. I took a photo at the time, because of my concern.   My shoulder joint was quite sore and stiff the next few days. 3 1/2 weeks later I still have an aching burning pain;  it feels as if they hit the shoulder capsule or the periosteum.   My questions are as follows:  Do you think this is too high to inject? Do you think I will have gotten enough absorption anyway?  Is there a way to get measured for the antibody response in this situation?  Should this be reported as an adverse event?  ( I hate to get anyone upset at our hospital, as I am grateful I got the vaccine and intend to get the booster Will this affect the booster?

                                                I had a possible reaction on my Left arm and chest. My Right arm received the injection. I never have any sticks in my left arm since I have  developed Lymphedema post breast cancer mastectomies and treatment in  April 2006. When I arose  my effected arm was red in color, with a rash on top of that. It was hot to the touch and swollen and stiff.  My husband took me to the emergency room of the hospital named in Item 21 and later that day I was admitted to the hospital. They diagnosed it as a severe infection, resulting in cellulitis and started me on round the clock IV antibiotics.

                                                A few hours after my vaccination, my arm became extremely sore and was extremely sore all night, and remained so the next day. I have a high pain tolerance, but my arm felt as if it had received a powerful injury, and was hard to lift without using my other arm.  I also had a slight fever the next day, chills and muscle aches and fatigue. I am normally very active, but spent the day in bed. The next day I felt much better although my arm was very sore for another day or two. Then, the evening of the 21st of Feb., my arm, at the vaccination site became very itchy and was painful to touch in that area. I slept well but woke with the same itchiness, and soreness, and now tonight, Feb. 22nd, that area is still itchy and a bit sore. But I have not had the swelling and redness that I am reading about with Covid arm.

My stomach was queasy.  By the next morning, my joints hurt so much it was difficult to roll over in bed, and all the other symptoms were still there and worse.  I did not have a fever.  I developed a headache.  All I could do was lie in bed; sitting up felt exhausting.  By evening of that day, my joint pain was lessening and my stomach felt somewhat better.  By the following morning, I felt normal, basically.  So in total, about a day and a half of bad reaction.

                                                Four hours after injection suffered severe body pains with nausea for several hours, and red rash about two inches in diameter popped up. The next day the injection site was red, with an expanding hard tissue underneath the skin, about five inches in diameter. Seven days later the rash was almost gone. Eight days later the rash came back with a vengeance, extremely itchy and expanding to three inches in diameter. As of this report, at ten days post-injection, the rash remains at three inches diameter and itchy.

I developed a rash on February 16, 2021 that started with just a few bumps under my armpits and gradually went down both sides of my torso to my groin.  It appeared to get much worse after the second vaccine injection.  They are tiny red bumps.

I used topical hydrocortisone cream and Caladryl.    The rash ended up being about 2&#34; x  3&#34; in size. It felt slightly sore but not much.   I took pictures if you want them. After  few days I took a Benadryl product as my whole body started feeling slightly itchy off and on but I think thats just from being nervous about arm rash.

The worst Shingles outbreak I have ever had, while I had previously had Shingles approximately every 5-6 years for the past 45 years.  The severity of this case was markedly different from any other Shingles outbreak I have ever had. Previously, I did have both the Varivax vaccination (approx 10 years ago) as well as two doses of the Shingrix vaccination (approx 3-4 years ago).

At ~9:45pm, my wife suddenly fell unconscious. Immediate CPR &amp; with Paramedic were not able to revive her. SHE PASSED AWAY at home. We believe it may be triggered by the vaccine.  Did not have a chance to go to hospital or emergency room - it was too sudden. A sad day for us.

                                                A week after injection I developed a fairly large area (6&#34; long by 3&#34; wide) with erythemia, mild swelling, and accompanying pruritis, and with scattered petechiae around the injection site on my upper left arm. Still present three days later but resolving. It was not sufficient to cause any difficulty with my daily activities and did not require any medical intervention. I did apply 1% hydrocortisone cream with no significant effect. I just wanted to report it because this is a new vaccine, and I wanted to make sure any side effect was noted for research purposes.

What surprised me is that the site (about 9 cm round) became very red and very itchy a full week later (01/05/2021) and is still pink and itchy now.  This is not at all serious, and Benadryl cream reduces the itching.  I am reporting it only because it is not listed as a side effect on the documentation or CDC website.

The inflamation is also warm to the touch. I contacted pharmacy, spoke with the pharmacist who suggested applying ice and taking an antihistamine. After applying ice, I only saw that the inflamed spot continued to spread down my left arm and is now about 4&#34; by 6&#34;, still warm and red.

It was red, hot and itchy and painful.  There was an on outer line that encircled it. I called my dermatologist on day 12 and she prescribed a cortisone prescription cream that I applied 2x per day.

On 01/24/2021 roughly at 04:45 A.M., I began to chill/shiver.  The injection site on my right arm had become hot to the touch, peppered with red blotches, swollen and began to hurt again.  I did take 1000mg of Tylenol for discomfort.  I felt flushed, but no fever to speak of, rather lethargic.  Today, 01/25/2021, the injection site is one large reddened, hot, swollen area about a size 3x4 inches.  At this time, I have not visited my physician or any Urgent Care.

                                                Injection site redness; Cellulitis at the injection site; A spontaneous report was received from a pharmacist, concerning a 70-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced cellulitis at the injection site and injection site redness.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020 the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011J20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced redness at the injection site.  On 05 Jan 2021, twelve days after vaccination, the patient experienced cellulitis at the injection site and had to consult at an urgent care. Treatment for the event included amoxicillin/clavulanante.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, cellulitis at the injection site and injection site redness, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 70 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of cellulitis at the injection site and injection site redness. The event of cellulitis occurred 14 days after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. The event of injection site redness occurred after the first dose of vaccine on an unknown date. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

The event of dyspnoea, pruritus, and erythema occurred 1 day after first dose mRNA-1273 (Lot# 075T202A) administration. The event of hemiplegia and urticaria occurred 3 days after first dose mRNA-1273 (Lot# 075T202A) administration.

                                                ELEVEN days after vaccination my right upper arm was a little sore at the injection site.  In the morning on the 12th day, January 29, 2021, I have a red, hard, slightly raised welt in the area of the injection site which is a little sore. I would say this is kind of circular and about 3 inches across.  The only effect I had the day  right after the shot was a little soreness and a little redness.  Today the area of the welt is a lot bigger and harder.

Used Benadryl to stop itching so not to scratch.  Lasted about 4-5 days but did not think much about it until I read where several people had the same symptoms, but only happened in primarily women 30-40 years of age.  Thought you may be interested as I am 70.

                                                Red rash that started out about a 2 inch square (about 10 days from when I got the vaccine) that kept growing to wrap around half of my upper arm.  It itched some, and was warm to the touch.  On day  14, after discussion with Dr., he thought it was a skin infection, so prescribed antibiotics (Cephalexin 500 MG Capsules taken 3 times a day), which I started taking on day 14.  By Day 18 the rash has calmed down, not as red or visible,  but still there.  This was for the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine, my arm was sore. All the typical side effects in the paperwork I had. The next day I had a low fever of 99.9 and I noticed my arm was red. It is still red as of today it is about 3 inches in width. I went back to the pharmacist to let them look at it and they referred me to contact VAERS. It is not bothering or anything like that.

At the initial visit, the provider thought the patient had cellulitis.  Therefore a course of 7 days of Keflex was given. Patient finished her antibiotic and those symptoms still persisted. She came back to her primary care with still mild erythema and warmth of the left lateral arm.  At this time, her doctor diagnosed her with a local reaction to the COVID vaccine  and the patient was sent home with triamcinolone which she had.

                                                Exactly 1 week after receiving the vaccine, my right upper arm (the one in which I received the shot) started itching  a lot.  I noticed there was a lumpy swelling under my skin and the skin was red and warm. I have now had the itchy swelling  for 4 days and think it is going down a bit. It never hurt, just itched. I am telling you this so you can warn others to expect this mild reaction so they will not worry. I looked it up and it is  called &#34;covid arm&#34;. It relieved me that I am not alone with this condition. Feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you!

                                                Woke up about 1 a.m. and was scratching my wrist.  I got up and turned on the light.  My hands were sort of a splotchy red (more red than not...) and itched, especially the wrist of my left hand.   My fingers were a bit puffy, but not swollen.  I ran my hands under cold water and used a hand cream.  They still itched a bit, but were better.  I waited a bit and reapplied hand cream.  I was tired and fell back asleep about 1:30 a.m.  When I woke up about 7 a.m., my hands were fine and there was no itching.  I have been fine since (altho I experienced the tiredness others have mentioned).

As day progressed felt discomfort, site began to get itchy. In evening checked and blotches became one mass, swollen, very warm to touch. Called pharmacy, they never heard of delayed reaction said take benedryl and call primary dr in morning. Went to pharmacy, the pharmacist looked at it and felt it, also never saw delayed reaction, gave same instructions. Sent picture to primary, did video call today, 99.7 temp, elevated BP and pulse. She saw picture, close up on screen, concerned one spot darker might be cellulitis, need to watch, take benedryl, call if changes, report to CDC

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

I had a bad headache on the back of my head and neck. I used an electrical heating pad on my feet, then I developed a fever. Suddenly I woke up and vomited. I felt a little relief. Took Tylenol again.  I could not move well due to bad muscle aches and stiffness.  Site of injection pain is almost gone, but I am still feeling Ill.

                                                After 7 days my arm began to swell and hurt.  Raised rash started to form and arm became warm to touch.  Each day after the initial discovery,  the rash grew larger and the pain and heat grew in  intensity.  I iced my arm and took 3 Advil.  As of today the swelling has subsided.  The redness now  is across the entire front of my arm but the pain no longer prevails.

I was shaky for a couple of more hours.  I had an upset stomach. I was very cold, but had waited in a 2 hour line outside in 20 degree weather because they were overwhelmed at the facility. And only had 3 doctors giving the shots.    I was able to swallow the whole time.

                                                On the first day of the injection (1/14/2021) the left arm was sore and I felt tired. Towards evening and during the night I felt cold and hot at the same time - an intense burning/freezing sensation, but no sweating. On the first day after the injection (1/15/201) the arm was still sore and I still felt tired - burning/freezing sensation had ceased. On the second day after the injection (1/16/2021) the left arm was not sore and I felt better, but at 11:00 a.m. the vein in the left temple burst and bled until about 6:00 p.m. Continuous throbbing pain across the forehead the entire day. The  middle of the forehead is covered with red dots; the area near the left eye has a number of open, bloody lesions; the area below the temple (left cheek) is black and blue. There are also two bright red spots on my left knee - but no bleeding. Nausea was slight, but present during the entire day on Saturday and Sunday. Since the hospitals have Covid 19 patients and I do not have a car, I stayed home and rested in bed.  Today on Sunday (1/17/2021) I can sit up and walk around somewhat; the throbbing pain in the head has ceased. The lesions are still vivid red , but slowly forming a crust.  Will make contact with my doctor  on Monday, when the office is open.

                                                4 days after the vaccine, I had EXCRUCIATING nerve pain, starting at the upper vertabrae and  shooting down both arms to fingertips. Sometimes all the way down my back and the back of my legs.  I vomited all day, had a low fever which  lasted for 24 hours, then the pain and fever subsided. Still have nausea but no more vomiting .  I went to a doctor  after that, he also thinks it was a reaction..  On the 7th day, a purple splotchy rash showed on my skin and my hands started swelling up at night, so painful I couldn&#39;t even pull up the sheet.  The hand swelling goes down during the day and comes back at night.  I plan to get an antibody test  on  Feb. 26.  I am 98% certain that I had COVID in July, it was precisely the same symptoms and I had with the vaccine.  No treatment, just resting tilll it&#39;s over.  I am almost 80% better now, but not completely. I worry that I will never get back to 100%, it&#39;s been  11 days now.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA A few hours after I received the vaccine I had a circular rash around the injection site which lasted about four days. The rash disappeared, but the area continued to be a hardened. Last night the rash reappeared and the itchiness returned. From information I have read this is a reported side effect. I wondered how long it will last. My second dose is March 11. Should I have the injection in my other arm?

It was not swollen or painful but was a little warm.  I called the on-call doctor who suggested cold compresses and wait to see if any other changes.  By Monday 2/22/21 it appeared less red but still warm and no change in shape.  continue to monitor.  Called doctor&#39;s office to report same.  (My doctor on leave)

She rubbed the area and the reaction was below the injection site (1/4&#34; below).  It runs down the arm 3&#34; from the injection toward her elbow, and width is 5&#34;.  It is not as puffy as it was, somewhat paler, but very obvious and noticeable.  It is not itching as bad, and is putting wet washcloths on it for relief.  The size of it is still the same size and has not changed, possibly spread a little.   She called her doctor who told her to take Tylenol and put the cool rags on it.

On  2/24/2021 I went  see an eye doctor Dr. He diagnosed me with &#34;whiss&#34; ring around both of my eyes, and seen spot on my lenses on my left eye.  I started starburst with my left eye, this did not develop until after I received the vaccine.  I have a dot on my right eye now. On 02/26/2021 see another eye doctor Dr., he also said I have deposits around my cornea, acknowledged the starburst effect on the left eye, and noticed the &#34;whiss&#34; ring.  Since I took the vaccine my eyes have become very light sensitive.  The doctors have told me this conditions are permanent, if it gets worse they will have to scrape the eye and have a laser surgery.  I do  not remember when it started but it 2inches by 3 inches, red patch which started at the injection site and went diagonal.

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

Rash has looked gone and not affected me during part of some days, then will flare up later at night and seems to be in places at times, like legs, other side of my face  and then gone. Not particularly itchy, mostly a feeling of irritation and  rash  on right side of face feels tight, like when you have a sunburn.

                                                My arm started itching yesterday but I did not look at the injection site.  My arm continues to itch; today there is a pink/red area on my upper arm about 2 1/2 inches across. I am concerned that I may be allergic to the first injection and that it will be a much stronger reaction with the second injection. At this time, this is not a serious reaction. I had a flu shot 17 days previously in my opposite arm.  I do not have vaccine information for this shot.

Soreness went away and injection site could not be found. 5 days after the shot was administered,, my arm started getting sore and I felt achy.  The 6th day, symptoms got worse, achy and chills, but no fever that I am aware of.  7th day, symptoms persisted but not as bad, except that my arm had swollen up and turned red all the way to my elbow and felt  like a large hard knot.  Today, I am not as achy or chilled, but my arm is still hot, red, and swollen .  The redness is below the injection site, although the injections site looks like a little red pimple, whereas earlier, I couldn&#39;t even find it.

                                                Initially, the only side effect was soreness at the site of injection.  5 days later, I started feeling tired and achy.  I developed chills and had muscle aches like the flu.  No fever.  The next day, my arm started getting sore below the injection site and itched.  That night, my whole arm was swollen, red,  sore, hot to touch and itched.  The redness extended around my upper arm and down to the elbow.  It had been 8 days since the vaccination and I still have the red itchy arm.

It is oval in shape, about 5 inches long, inflamed and itching.  It seems to improve and then increase.  I have used over the counter lotions to ease the itching, but I am now in day 6

Then 7 days after the vaccine, she experienced severe pruritis that actually woke her from sleep and had been scratching the area. It has now on day 8 become much more indurated and has grown in size, even during today.

I got worried and went to an urgent care clinic where they thought that it was a minor reaction.   I went home and had breakfast and felt much better within 2 hours.  Have felt fine since.  Had a sore arm for one day, no redness, or swelling.

                                                Had vaccine and on Sunday afternoon she laid down and took a 3 hour nap.  Patient does not generally bruise, noticed a 5&#34; long, 2&#34; wide, 3&#34; from her elbow bruise underneath her armpit, blue in color.  Noticed it while drying her hair without a robe on.  Today, where the shot was given there is a temperature and a bruise surfacing there as well.  Went into the health site where she lives and got the fact sheet and our phone #, so decided to report it.  It was frightening to her as it was so large.  It is still there today, 1/25/21.  The one on top at needle insertion is at skin surface approximately 2-2 1/2&#34; long.  Never felt her insert the needle for the vaccine, so is shocked that she is having reaction.  No treatment for it.

                                                The day of vaccine on 1/10/21, took a nap and slept for 3 hours.  On Tuesday, 1/19/21 noticed the very large bruise while drying her hair, which she does not bruise.  The bruise was 5&#34; long, 2&#34; wide, fist size and 3&#34; from her elbow from armpit to elbow.  The first size is right under the injection site.  The injection site itself was hot to touch this morning 1/24/21.  It is just warm right now at 1:46 PM.  There is also a bruise that is coming to the surface, 2&#34; round, not migrating to other area.

I sent my doctor a picture and he prescribed Cephalexin 500mg on January 25 in case it was an infection.  My arm is no longer tender but it&#39;s still red and a bit swollen. It hasn&#39;t gotten any worse since yesterday.

On January 28 I noticed a red rash in a 2 circle  at injection site. The area is swollen and warm to the touch. On January 28 I saw a nurse at the Health Dept. She said they have been seeing this following the Moderna vaccine and told me to put cool compresses on it and hydrocortisone cream for the itching. Also told me to take a Benadryl in the evening. Said it should get better in a few days. However today, January 29 it had gotten worse with the red rash area increasing in size and it is still swollen and itches.

No pain.  Initially felt a little fatigue after shot, but this side effect was delayed.  Since I am unble to get second dose in right arm due to Lymphedema from Breast Cancer surgery (2004), I want to be sure I can get second dose in  that arm.

Very slightly itchy.  No fever, no chills, no systemic symptoms, no pain.  Today, on day 12, only 20% of the rash remains, and it is fading (now only slightly pink).  In other words, it is disappearing.  I noticed it on day 10, but don&#39;t know when it started-- probably a couple of days before that.  It wasn&#39;t there on day 2.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 21 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 043L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient experienced injection site reaction.  On 22 Jan 2021, she was feeling achy.   On 23 Jan 2021, she had nerve pain that felt like cutting on the back, legs, and arms.  On 24 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s muscles were weak and were not working or responsive on both sides.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient could not control her left hand and weakness was more predominant on left side. The patient went to the doctor and was hospitalized with minor stroke for 24 hours. The patient stated that she was still experiencing terrible pain in neck and lower back.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, minor stroke, weak muscles, nerve pain, injection site reaction, and achy, was unknown. The outcome of event, terrible pain in neck and lower back, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and evidence of a temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and the onset of injection site reaction and achy, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. There is limited information to asses causality for the events of injection site reaction, and achy.  Additional information has been requested.

                                                Received #1 dose as stated.  Next day, 1/27/21, 9:00am , had mild joint pain to both legs, &amp; arms, &amp; slightly tired.  Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

                                                On 01/11/2021, within a few hours of my grandmother getting the shot her injection area became red, swollen and hot to the touch. At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

                                                On the 9th day after vaccination, my left arm started itching in the early evening  (Jan. 12).  Next morning, Jan. 13, I noticed that there was a large, round area at the injection site (size of a tennis ball) that was red.  It no longer itched.  Later, I put cold compress on site.  Did not appear to be swollen.  But it was very warm to touch. I called primary doctor and am still waiting for call back.  On Jan. 14, upon waking, the redness had diminished in intensity, but not in size.  Still warm, but not as warm.  By mid-day, redness decreased more, still warm, but appears to be going away.  No other symptoms or side effects.

Took 2 Tylenol (500mg).  Left arm muscle tender but no redness  at injection site.  Slept good that night.  1/15/2021 woke up itching and saw  bumpy light red rash on both upper thighs.  Applied 2% Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride which helped.  Fever and headache gone and did not return.  Body aches less each day.  1/17?2021 Body aches, arm soreness gone. Itchy rash lighter in color, but remains today as I file this. Not concerned about it. Am sure it will go away soon.

A surgeon friend recommended doxycycline because he thought it was cellulitis.  And I took Benadryl 50mg.  I took Doxy and Benadryl at night and in the AM.  I took the Benadryl 2 hours prior to the Doxy and it was looking less red before I even took the Doxy.  After consulting with my own doctor in the AM, she advised me to stop the doxy and the benadryl and let nature take it&#39;s course.  he redness subsided with 4 days and it was much less itchy.  It was still a bit sore but that resolved within a week.  I did not see the doctor in her office.  I sent her a picture of my arm and we talked on the phone.

                                                One week after the vaccine my upper arm started to itch.  By the next morning I had a rash on the upper arm with insane itching.  The second ay the itching has dissipated, but the arm is now sore at the injection site and the rash has spread.  The rash is not as red.as it was on 1/19/21.   I have been taking an antihistamine and rubbing hydrocortisone cream on the rash.

Saw my primary and she said it could be they gave it too high and irritated the shoulder joint.  She is concerned about &#34;frozen shoulder&#34;.  It wakes me in the night and no position lasts without pain after 30-45 seconds.  Take one extra strength Tylenol before bed and administer Sagely 250 mg. BD cream on upper arm and part of neck where pain exits.  Last night I drank 3 glasses of red wine so I could sleep a few hours and today I have had no pain!   little weakness and I&#39;m trying not to aggravate it, but hopefully the site pain is resolving.

                                                2 weeks after receiving vaccine I developed intense itching and redness at injection site. a series of small bumps in varying sizes appeared.  The itching subsided after about an hour, but redness and inflammation continued.  The next day I showered and the site became inflammed and very hot it then morphed into one solid thick abrasion. I had no redness just soreness when first injected and no other symptoms other than an increase in sciatica issues making it difficult at times to walk, sit, or, bend.  The abrasion is approximately 3 inches in diameter.

                                                Initial site reaction was sore upper arm, no initial redness or other issues. General slight body aches and pains over the next 24 hours with no issues. No additional problems until on approximately Day 9 (Saturday after the immunization), the left arm became erythematous from approximately the vaccination site to almost the elbow.  This erythema was approximately three inches wide and the skin was raised slightly. Area was slightly itchy, not painful, and was warm to the touch. Erythema increased over the next 3 days and I sent a picture to my primary care physician. He advised a Medrol dose pack and Keflex. I requested that I be able to start the Keflex but hold off on the Medrol dose pack for a couple of days. He suggested Benadryl q 6 hours. I sent pictures each day. Two days later, there was some improvement but the provider did not feel there was enough improvement and he encouraged me to start the Medrol dose pack. I started the dose pack on Day 14 (Thursday) around 2 p.m. By 9:00 p.m. on the same day, there was considerable improvement in the look of the arm and the skin was only slightly raised. At the time of this report on Day 18, Monday 01/25/2021, I will finish the Medrol dose pack tomorrow. There is a shadow of where the erythema was and there is no raised skin.

                                                Had normal side effects the day after, 12/25/20 slight fever, lethargy, not even sore arm. on the 27th, felt fine.  On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                #1. I received the Moderna vaccine on 1/18/2021 in my right upper arm. On that Monday I experienced a small ache and redness at the injection site. On Tuesday 1/19 I had flu like symptoms, more pain at the injection site and a larger and firmer area at the injection site. Wed. 1/20 flu like symptoms were gone, but my upper arm was very sore in movement and by touch, was very red and swelling occurred. Thurs. 1/21 my upper arm was still painful to touch and swollen. Friday 1/22 a little less sore, still very red and itchy. Saturday 1/23 only slight discomfort, but very itchy. 1/24 Through 1/27 still very dark pink, still some swelling and intensely itchy. There was something hard protruding from the injection site, On 1/25 we tried to pull it out but it broke off and we dropped it before we could examine it. There is still a small amount of whatever it was protruding from the injection site. My next dose is supposed to be given on 2/15/2021, but I am very anxious about receiving it. I have reached out in an email dated 1/25/2021 but no response so far. My husband has an appointment with a dermatologist today 1/27/2021 and I am going to ask the Dr. to look at my arm.

I don?t know how long it has been there. It was not there the first couple of days immediately following the injection and so I stopped checking. I noticed it 11 days post injection.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

The ER doctor prescribed Prednisone 20 MG for five days, Famotidine 20 MG for five days and an Epi pen just in case I needed it.

                                                On Sat morning upon arising and taking a shower I noticed a red line almost welt on my arm by afternoon there were 2 lines and they were getting longer and wider. By Monday morning the area covered with puffiness and redness was about  at least 4 inches wide and going  almost entirely around the arm. It hurt and was very warm to touch along with starting to itch. It was not hard at the\at time. Placed a call to my doctor and was advised to see him or urgent care. I choose the later to do. In checking it out they mentioned that they have been seeing the quite often in the last couple weeks. Take an aspirin, tylenol or ibuprophn  and put cold conpresses on for 20 minutes as often as I can. This morning (Tuesday 23rd of February) it has enlarged again some redness is gone but it apprears to be black and blue now. Still itching, I have not itched it as of yet.

I left the waiting room at 11:55.  One hour later, I had an extremely dry mouth &amp; needed water.  It resolved after drinking a bottle of water.  At 4:30pm I started itching in my hands, feet, &amp; entire body - itchiness was like prickles, not normal itching.  Took Claritin which kept itching under control.  I have taken Claritin 10mg daily for the last 5 days to keep itching under control. Today I am more itchy than yesterday.

Arm of patient was sore with minimal swelling after vaccination and resolved. 8 days after vaccination, vaccine arm started itching and is red, warm, and swollen (patient estimates the size of an orange). Patient also reports that there are whelps around the injection site. Patient called PCP and was advised to take Benadryl and watch;  if more systemic reactions develop, to seek emergency care.

                                                Red rash on face.  At first, 1/13/21, I didn&#39;t think it was related to the vaccine.  It spread and worsened over the next four days and then the injection site became red also that was when I related it to the vaccine, 1/18/21.  I sent a picture to my doctor, a friend, who retired, and he said to take Benadryl and Pepcid AC, which I did for 3 days (1/18/21 - 1/10/21).  I now have just a little roughness to my face and a very pale red mark by the injection site.

                                                By the late afternoon/early evening  I had developed a rash that covered my body from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head.  The rash was clearly visible but not bumpy.  It was extremely itchy.   I took Benadryl and soaked in an Epsom Salt bath several times that night as I was unable to sleep due to the intense itching.  The next morning (Saturday) I called my doctor and was prescribed a steroid to combat the itching  but was told not to take it until Monday so as not to interfer with the antibodies my body was obviously producing in response to the vaccine.  I was also instructed to start taking  one Zyrtec tablet each morning and two Benadryl tablets each night.  On Monday morning (01/25/2021) I began taking Methylprednisolone (4mg Dospak 21s) which relieved the itching.  At this time the rash is greatly reduced and the itching has almost stopped.  I will continue the meds until the  dosage is completed.

She sat for approximately 20 minutes with a cold compress on her arm over the swollen, hardened area. She complained about being dizzy after about approximately 15 minutes of her observation period. Her blood pressure was taken and it was approximately 130/80. She sat down for about 10 more minutes and left when she was no longer dizzy. She did not report any more symptoms. Denied pain in her arm. Did not report issues swallowing or breathing.

I?m allergic to adhesive and thought the rash was from the bandaid. Rash became feverish and swollen.  Has remained that way until January 25 when drs office was contacted and they suggested I take Barnadryl .  I had taken Claritin for two days prior with no change to the rash.  Rash has reduced 50% in redness.  Still visible.

I am on my way to buy Benadryl tablets to see if itching will stop. Since applying Benadryl topically it seems to relieve the  severity of the itchiness elsewhere.

Day 8, arm itchy and red around the injection site.  Warm to the touch. Day 9, more redness and larger area. Size of a silver dollar.  Talked to the nurse at a local gym. Suggested a clinic. I Saw a Nurse Practioner at a clinic. She thought perhaps it was an insect bite as the red area was about 4 inches below where a &#39;normal shot&#39; would be given. Prescribed cream and antibiotic. I didn&#39;t take it.  Took Benadryl (pill). Improving after 1 hr of taking Benadryl.

Started feeling sick during the night, knew something was wrong.  Could barely get out of bed, was hot, possibly low grade fever, had chills, was achy, bad headache like you feel when having the flu, weakness.   Took Tylenol and her regular medicines.  Today, 1/29/21 when she woke up still has extreme soreness, hot to touch.  She looked at her left arm and it&#39;s all swollen, red and itchy.  She&#39;s now afraid to go back for the 2nd vaccine.   Caller her pharmacy due to her arm and she was instructed to take Benadryl and Ibuprofen, which she only takes Tylenol.

                                                On Jan 26th when I woke up in the morning I saw that a large portion of my upper left arm was very bright red and over the subsequent 3 days including today the area of redness expanded, got larger. So now the red rash is covering almost my entire upper left arm down to the elbow. And day of onset I had a low grade fever but temp was normal after that. In the center of the rash, there is a darker area that was slightly swollen and the whole area, but especially the darker, area is warm to the touch. I did see the Dr. on Wednesday January 27th and he prescribed Keflex antibiotic which I am still taking.

                                                First Vaccine, no side effects except sore arm for one day and a lot of bruising at injection site which left in 8 days. Vaccine 2 awakened at 2:00 AM in extraordinary pain in my whole body,, dry heaved for 4 hours, sweats and chills, temp only 99 (I usually run 97) Felt sick to stomach rest of  day. Never felt this sick.  By evening it left as quickly as it came.  Was tired for several days but nothing else. On Feb 16th awakened with an very sharp pain in the injection site when I moved my arm up to stretch. This has gotten worse every day. When I move my arm in a certain direction it feels like it is ripping inside. It is not bruised and not painful to the touch. It is inside and in the same location as the injection. Heat and ice make no difference. It seems to be getting more painful and feel it more often. It is painful enough that I let out a yelp when I forget and lift my arm a certain way. As of yesterday I feel it all day, not the sharp pain but more a inside burning, not enough to stop me, but I know it os there.

                                                At site of shot on night of Feb 16, my arm was itchy and hurting.  By the morning of Feb 17, My arm was swollen at the site shot, red, hard and painful.  I was alarmed as this was a full week after the vaccine and my arm had not bothered me for the first week.  I reported to Health Dept &amp; received a call from a volunteer doctor who told me I had Covid Arm and to use  cold pack, tylenol to relieve symptoms and benydryl at night to help me sleep.   I am due to get shot #2 on March 9 and am concerned.  My Covid Arm lasted 5 days and went away.

Red area on sot arm by that evening - next day (2nd day after shot) developed red rashes by  outside of each breast, larger spot by left side (where shot was given), spot on left side of my neck also.  Not a raised or bumpy rash at all, not sore or itchy.    Called advise nurse to determine taking a benedryl was ok and took one last night.  This morning rash less noticeable but still there - also new little mark on inner left elbow.  Feeling fine this whole time, just concerned because I haven?t read of this reaction much for second Moderna.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot: L0AM20A) on 28-Jan-2021. On 16-Feb-2021, approximately 6 hours prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot: 015M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Six hours, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine the patient reported that she had diarrhea, just once. She stated that went to sleep and woke up a little tired the next day and had some diarrhea. The patient reported that she was a little tired and slept for nine and a half hours.  She also stated that she had an achy arm. On 17-Feb-2021, she stated that she was feeling fine at that time.   Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, diarrhea, achy arm/vaccination site pain, tired/fatigue, was considered unknown . The outcome of the event, inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 Y/O F with nonserious unexpected event of inappropriate schedule of product administration with mRNA-1273 (lot # unknown) and adverse events of NS unexpected diarrhea and NS expected vaccination site pain, fatigue.  Adverse events occurred 6 hours after second dose mRNA-1273, and event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She said she had an epi pen with her. I asked her if she thought it was time to administer and call 911 she said yes. We proceeded. She said her throat was feeling a little better but chest was tight and she was having a dry cough. Ambulance took her to hospital. I called her around Noon the next day to check in on her and she said she was in hospital still being monitored. Was advised not to get second dose of vaccine from hospital.

At that point , subcutaneous reaction was hard, indurrated , mildly painful to touch  to touch and covered by erythema  like a giant local reaction to an allergy shot. Skin over the site remained erythematous and pruritic. I treated with high potency topical steroids as there was was limited pain, no fluctuance or pointing and no fever by thermometer. The reaction decresed in size over 5  dayof topical steroid use.

I noticed two red swollen circles last night on January 14.  Each circle is about the size of a quarter.  I took benadryl and applied neosporin.  The circles are still there but not burning or itching.  If you can please pass on to Vsafe group. I observed my arm immediately after injection on 1/7 and it appeared ok.  I didn&#39;t pay attention to my arm when showering.  Only after i started itching did I look at arm on 1/14/2021.

Blood pressure rose to 170-190 over 110 and would not go down.  Doctor advised I go to the E.R. for assessment, which I did. Blood pressure remained elevated for days . Noted the systolic was higher , mostly in the 80&#39;s.  I do not have hypertension BP this morning  in the 120&#39;s over 70.  Needed Alprazolam to calm my anxiety since.  Not every day. Very concerned about having the second dose. Doctor has advised me to only drink water the day of shot, take a tranquilizer an hour before and has given me BP med to take if my BP goes over 150.

On 1/22 morning I saw large red circle that was slightly sore and hot to the touch. On 1/22 afternoon I called for appointment.  Since none was available I went to urgent care where I was prescribed Doxycycline.  Have been taking it as prescribed and circle has been slowly fading away but is still visible.  I  thought it might have been a reaction to an insect bite, but now a friend who got the vaccine the same day I did is experiencing the same reaction.   I  would like to know if you think this is connected to the vaccine and if so could it affect the efficacy of the vaccine? I am also concerned about taking the second dose.

Over the next three days the redness moved down my arm, covering an area of 6 inches and nearly all the way around my arm.  The arm was stiff and painful and hot to the touch.  On Monday,  1/25/21, I contacted my primary care doctor.

I don&#39;t know if it is normal for the site to be reddened.

It itches, is red, but other than the itch it has not bothered me at this point.  I went to a walk-in clinic and was told it could be cellulitis. (bacteria) at the injection site.  He has placed me on an antibiotic starting today.  The rash, swelling on my arm, is hot to the touch and I prefer non-one touch it.  The physician at the walk in said to add heat to the site.  I have also gotten a cough.   He prescribed something for this also.  My Covid case was very mild.

                                                Cellulitis; A spontaneous report was received from a 75-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed cellulitis.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included levothyroxine, clopidogrel, rosuvastatin, vitamin D, and zinc.   On 14 Jan 2021, approximately one week prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 21 Jan 2021, the patient developed cellulitis.   On 24 Jan 2021, the patient was seen in urgent care and given antibiotics for the cellulitis infection.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event, cellulitis, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report concerns a 75-year-old female patient on blood thinners who experienced a serious event of cellulitis approximately 1 week after the administration of the first dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot #: 041L20A, expiration date-Unknown).  Treatment given include an unspecified antibiotic, and outcome is unknown.  Based on the information provided, which includes a temporal association between the reported event and the administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded. Causality is confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.

                                                A week after injection, on evening of 2/10, I noticed a large red rash, very warm at vaccination site.  I called Dr. next morning and saw her that afternoon on 2/11.  She told me it was a reaction to the vaccine, and put me on antibiotics for 7 days. She traced the area with a pen, and told me to watch it. If it got worse and  spread a lot, I was to go to the hospital, as their office would be closed over the weekend. I started the antibiotics that day, and it has gotten better,  but not completed resolved.  It did spread slightly, but not enough to be concerned.

Itching is insignificant, and the arm is otherwise completely normal.   Since it is now about 10 days after the injection, I don&#39;t know how long it will take before the rash disappears.

                                                Woke up about 1:00 am in delirium and feverish. No control over thought process or able to get up. Managed to get out of bed at 9:00 am but was so weak could barely make it up a flight of stairs. And when I did ended up in bathroom vomiting. Laid on floor to get some strength back. Went back to bed and slept restlessly until 4:00 pm.  Still feverish and weak but not as bad as earlier. Ate some cold grapes and went back to bed until the following morning. Tried to stay hydrated and took ibuprofen several times. My upper arm was red and blotchy for 3 days. Overall I?d say the severest part of the event lasted 48 hrs and another 24 hrs of tiredness and nausea but not vomiting.

                                                Yesterday 2/21/21 started having itching on her arm, round area when she looked in the mirror at the time of her vaccine.  Area is warm, very itchy and 1 1/2&#34; x 1 1/2&#34; in size.  The area is also red today, intensely itchy.  Did put cortisone cream on it yesterday, which didn&#39;t make it go away, possibly reduced the itching some, but not much.  She does also have a headache today.  She takes a lot of vitamins, and has not taken anything else for the reactions.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine she felt a tingling/little something going down into her hand, but she did not think about it being the shot and did not report it.  Then went home, took a Tylenol and that afternoon her arm was sore like the normal reaction.  She went to bed, woke up at 1:00 AM and her arm was killing her/hurting.  She got up and went to the bathroom and noticed that her hand was swollen and the veins on the top of her hand were protruding.  She looked in the mirror and noticed that the left side of her neck was swollen.  Then she took her temperature and it was elevated, her normal is 97 and it was 99.  Later on that day on Saturday the inflammation got better.  She did not take anything for it.   The symptoms have progressively gotten better and now her hand is normal, her neck this morning looked normal and her temperature is back to her baseline.

After looking online, it appears patient has what is known as &#34;Covid Arm&#34;- fits the description and reported to us on day 11 after vaccine- she said symptoms started 10 days post vaccination.  Explained to the patient the information I found and explained it should resolve on its own.  If it did get worse, or if she did get a fever, it would be the best idea to seek medical attention. Told patient we would follow up with her in the next day or two to see how she was doing.

                                                Received the second dose of COVID 19 on Feb. 24, 2021, at 2:20 pm.  After the injection, I sat for 15 minutes, felt fine, then left, went home.  The next morning at 5 am, woke with right arm throbbing and a huge swelling where the vaccine was injected.  I got up, felt dizzy, and went the the bathroom, took my temperature, which was 101 F, then got the chills and had chest pains across my entire chest. Tried to go back to bed but the symptoms got worse.  Called my neighbor and asked him to take me to the ER.  He took me to the ER and I was checked for fever, had a chest x-ray, urine test, blood pressure checked and at 5 PM was admitted.
