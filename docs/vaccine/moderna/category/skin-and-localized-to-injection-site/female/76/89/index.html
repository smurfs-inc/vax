                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

                                                Observations Covid19 vaccine: On 1/8/21 the first of the 2-stage Moderna vaccine was injected at the facility.  The injection was barely felt and the symptoms were mild over the next few days. On January 17th - 9 days later - the area around the injection felt itchy upon waking.  Swelling, redness and heat were observed at the injection site in an area about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Soap and water was applied for the itchiness and Tylenol was taken. The itchiness mostly subsided.  Above the affected area a few scattered raised splotches are present. I had read about this set of reactions to the vaccine but had not read that this might occur as many as 9 days after the initial shot, so I thought I&#39;d share that with my doctor via My Chart and with you in case it was useful. Thanks. This is the first day of the reaction and I expect it to go away on its own over the next few days. It&#39;s not sore just slightly itchy.

Slight red, under the skin &#39;rash&#39; could barely be seen.  The individual spots did not seem to be the specific irritant.  The arm around the shoulder was somewhat achy and tight feeling.  I was able to sleep through the night after rubbing on Sarno-anti itch lotion.  Could not get comfortable on my left side, with the shoulder area hurting.

I scratched it and later looked in mirror.  Site was red  3 1/2&#34; X 4 1/2&#34;   It is now day 11 after shot and has spread 1/2 - 1  inch, but seems lighter.  Have taken picture every day to document.  I feel great otherwise and arm does not itch or bother me.  Just red.  Just wanted to make sure I can take next shot and thought I should report.

The circle was about 2 inches diameter.  Over the next two days, although the swelling abated, the rash expanded down and around my arm. I am now in my third day of having the rash. Now , the rash is about 6 inches down my arm  Like her, I am wondering whether I should have the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Eight days after the Covid Moderna injection, I had intense itching at the injection site.  Upon investigating, I had a huge welt 2 1/2 inches in diameter that itched obsessively.  The center of the welt was a white spot that was probably the injection site.  Several peripheral red spots were evident, probably from the intense itching.  I had noticed no issues in the days leading up to the 8th day.  I have only put aloe gel on the site.  Ready to report to my Primary.

Red  blotch on arm lasted 5 days, went away but came back a couple days later. This time was very itchy, swollen and hot. Size was about 3 inches down my arm from the injection site.. Lasted about 4 days.  Two weeks from shot, arm once again was itchy, with red dots near injection shot and down the arm.

Today 1/22/21, 8 days later, I woke up with my left arm sore at the vaccine site and when I looked, I found a bright red circle about 2&#34; in diameter around the site.  It is not hot to touch or sore - just a little itchy.  Since the vaccination I have used no ointments or lotions on my arm, have done the same exercise each day, and have had no bump or accident to my arm.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Ten days after the injection of Covid 19 injection my arm swelled up, and became very red and itchy at the site of the injection.  It just came up out of nowhere it seems as I had no reaction at all to the vaccine during the prior 10 days since the vaccination. This continued for two days.  The first day after it happened I felt tired and weak in the morning.  I got into work here at the house and the weakness went away.  I treated the itchy situation with Clobetasol Propionate Cream which I had here and was prescribed by my dermatologist for poison ivy.  That took away the itchy situation that was very annoying.  Two days into it the swelling began to go down.  Today is the 4th day since the problem occurred and there is no swelling and only a slight redness.  I am assuming that I can take injection #2 on February 9 as scheduled.

                                                I had no side effects after the injection except for very slight arm discomfort for a day or two.  Then, the evening of Day 6 (Jan. 20) I felt a little itchy around the injection site.  Morning of Day 7 (Jan. 21) I was very itchy and my upper right arm was very itchy, red and inflamed.   I called my dermatologist, and she told me to use a prescription cream I had from an irritation  on my thumb last year, called Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.1%.   I also called my primary doctor,  to let her know what was happening.  Day 8 (Jan. 22) my upper arm was still very inflamed and seemed to be spreading wider across my arm, maybe 4&#34;x3&#34;.  Day 9 (Jan. 23) a little better. Day 10 (Jan. 24) much better. Almost gone. Little bit of red left. Still using cream until it goes away..

On Wednesday evening (December 30), my right arm began to itch around the sight of injection.  Upon inspection, my arm was swollen and bright red in an area about four inches wide around the sight of injection.  As of the writing, the swelling and redness have disappeared.  I feel fine with no other symptoms

During the next six days the area enlarged in a bell shape extending to about two inches above my elbow and about half the circumference of my upper arm.  It would be more noticeable in the morning upon waking and later in the evening.  I would put a cool wet facecloth on the area.

I spoke to a doctor and he prescribed  Twice daily, of Doxycycline Hyclate. He said it was unusual to develop symptoms at this time so it could be a delayed  reaction or an infection. Airing on the side of caution, he prescribed the antibiotic. My temperature is normal and I have no other symptoms.  I?m also taking Benadryl to relieve itching. I?m on the medication for the next ten days.

                                                Itchy rash at injection site, started one week after 1st Covid inoculation (Jan 24).  Still present as of Jan. 29, 2021.  Lymph node under arm is swollen and sore.  Rash is not infected, only itchy.  Saw doctor Jan 26 who said it was either cellulitis or shingles.  Saw second doctor Jan 27 recognized it as Covid arm.  I wish this had been noted as a side effect on the web.  I could have saved myself both the cost and potential Covid exposure from two different doctors&#39; visits.  Also, it would be nice to know if this is a delayed allergic reaction to vaccine components or a beneficial reaction by the immune system.

                                                On Day 10  after the injection, I developed a red itchy hot rash on the left arm..  It continued to get larger and redder  until it cover most of the outside upper arm.  It did not start to go away until  Day 16.  By Day 18 it was only slightly visible.  On Day 10,  I started taking benedryl  because i thought it might be an allergic reaction.  By Day 11 I consulted with my doctor because it was so large and fire red.  I was given prednisone  and told to use cool compresses.

When I looked, it was swollen around the injection area...previously no irritation at all.  At the same time, I felt like I was catching a head cold:  lots of postnasal drip and some coughing and general tiredness.  Injection site symptoms lasted about 24 hours.  Cold like symptoms lasted 3 days.

These symptoms lasted 7 days.   When I went to bed on Tuesday night, I woke up early in the morning with palpitations, very nauseated, and light headed.  The palpitations lasted about 2 hours, light headedness about 30 minutes.  I had no further palpitations or light headedness after this.

About 5 days after the soreness went  away I developed a rash on my arm. My arm was hot and swollen.  I went to an urgent care the same day I noticed the rash, they put me on steroid and antibiotic Cephalexin. They also sent me to the ER for an ultrasound to make sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  It is normal now. Besides the rash I felt fine otherwise.

                                                The day after the injection I was sore and the arm was bruised, purplish color, and hot to the touch. And this morning I got very itchy around the vaccine site and its still red and hard to the touch, like there was a lump under the skin.  The bruise has faded a little but its not getting much better. Medical provider called to recommend benadryl and tylenol, and keep a warm pack on it, and also to seek help if it has not improved over the weekend.

I believe the shot was injected too high on my shoulder.  Pain was severe for 3 days and I took maximum Tylenol.  The arm is usuable now, pain is less, still have trouble raising the arm up or back.  I have had no other ill effects from the vaccine.

My arm swole up just as bad as from the previous arm did from the 1st vaccination but this time when healing it was like red and pink streaks were up and down my arm.

About 12n my daughter took the temp of my arm and it was 102 so we made ice packs to help with the pain and swelling.  Later she went an bought Cortisone and used the ice packs and Cortisone for about 3 or 4 days when the arm finally begin to get better.  My arm was so painful it was almost unbareable to touch.

                                                A few days after the injection, the site of the shot started to itch. Then it became slightly swollen and red, and felt warm to the touch. It continued at this level for another 2 days or so, then it started to recede. I took Advil to reduce symptoms. It took about 5 days after the onset of these symptoms for it to clear up. I am reporting this only for research purposes. I&#39;m fine.

I did not have any side effect when the injection given, other than a bit of soreness at site. Will follow. Read about others having this issue when I checked the websites. Will go ahead and have the scheduled second injection in a couple weeks. Suppose just a good sign my immune system is working? But thought any reactions should be shared with CDC or Maderna as part of their ongoing research.

                                                Patient experiencing a red rash below the injection site. She said this developed 12-24 hours post vaccine. She describes it as red, hot, and &#34;a little firm.&#34; Patient did take some acetaminophen 2/12/2021 but has not taken any since. I advised to take IBU or acetaminophen, ice, and rest to help with symptom management. Advised that if symptoms worsen to come in to be seen at the clinic.

There was some blood at the site and I still have a black and blue mark)

                                                Delayed reaction -- EIGHT DAYS AFTER my innoculation, I developed some swelling and itching in my upper left arm around the injection site. The area is oval shaped, about 2 by 3 inches, and the skin is pink. The swelling and itching have abated somewhat in the last 36 hours but not disappeared completely. I have twice applied ice to the area briefly, but have taken nothing else for the swelling and itching. I had no other reaction to the shot except slight soreness only the day after the shot. I find it strange that this swelling &amp; itching arose so much later (8 days).

Patient reported that it was periodically itchy and she has been scratching it. She stated that yesterday (day 9 after vaccination) that she noticed the size of the redness had increased. She said it was still periodically itchy and only slightly tender to the touch. She said she felt otherwise fine no systemic effects reported. Patient had not taken anything. Recommended benadryl and icing the area. Treatment outcome unknown at this time.

                                                The following day after my injection, I had bright RED hives all over my body except for my face and hands.  It was very uncomfortable.  I tried to calm my skin with lotions.  As the days progressed, the color receded and all of my skin started to peel.  It was terrib ly itchy and difficult to wear clothing. It took about a week for it to calm down, and the peeling continued for another week.

Extremely itchy!! Applied cortisone ointment to the area 2-3 times a day for approximately 3 days. Saw personal physician on 2/16/21 to discuss my reaction and to confirm that there was no need for concern and it would be safe to receive my second dose. As of this reporting, my arm has cleared up completely and I am no longer experiencing any itch or pain. At the time of the injection, I experienced pain as the vaccine was being administered and subsequently a very painful arm for approximately a week and a half.

On 2/12/2021 she felt better, no fever, but noticed she had developed a slight rash around the injection site.  On 2/14/2021 she noticed some red streaks moving down her left breast that disappeared fairly quickly.  She had an apt w/ her Dermatologist on 2/15/2021 and the pt had a slight rash on her left arm.  On 2/16/2021 she noticed she had a &#39;covid arm&#39; rash that covered 3/4 of her left upper arm.  On 2/18/2021 the rash was still noticeable and was itching so she took a Benadryl and then again on the 2/19/2021.  She saw her Dermatologist again on 2/24/2021, her rash is less red and seems to be disappearing.

I went to Clinic Saturday 2/13, for being unbalanced and weak, but not so dizzy. Sunday 2/14 I was extremely weak with low blood pressure and fast heart rate.  Monday  2/15, in the morning,  my left arm started hurting, swelling, was feverish, red, itchy and I had a rash at the injection site. I went to my doctor on 2/19 and he stated that maybe I should not get the 2nd vaccine shot. He stated that he was not certain that everything that happened was a result of the vaccine, but that he couldn&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t.

                                                On February 14, I had used the handlebar rotation exercise of a stationery bike for 5 minutes.  The next day I noticed a large swelling about the size of half a pear on the muscle where my Moderna injection was done.  It was as hard as a nut, red, and warm and itchy with a red rash around it.  I saw an urgent care medical person and was told it was probably a reaction to the exercise and that sometimes that happens after an injection.  I was told to use cold compresses, hydrocortison cream, and rest it.  I did this, for 5 days, but  though the swelling subsided, the rash continued to move around and down my arm.  I went back to urgent care on February 19 and was told that it looked better.  I was offered prednazone for it, but declined since I was still on Budesonide .  I was told it would probably clear up over the weekend.  On February 22  it hadn&#39;t cleared up so I saw  a PC.  She  noted the rash  had spread, but swelling had gone down.  She checked my lymph node under my left arm and noticed it was swollen.  She said it was most likely due to a mild infection in the arm where I had  received the vaccination.  She  prescribed  a Zpack and after 2 days, all symptoms were gone and I felt so much better.  This event happened 10 days after my vaccination.

The next morning I woke up and the rash was there, and spread over the different areas of body. I was sweating bad, muscle pain, joint pain, and nauseated for about 3 days. I had knots in my arms. I went to the doctor last week, and she gave me a shot in the hip, it helped with the swelling.  Then I called her back and she called in a cream for me.  The other symptom remaining is the rash at the injection site, I have been putting the cream on it twice a day, taking Benadryl and Tylenol for pain

She said she has no chills this morning. She states that her arm where she received the 2nd dose of COVID-19 (left deltoid) is pink, warm to the touch (can feel warmth through clothes), and tender to the touch. She said her husband will use a marker to mark the borders of the area of concern on that arm to see if the borders change with time. I notified Dr. of this information. I notified her that Dr. recommends she place heat on that area of her arm and to call us if any further symptoms develop. She also said she will notify us if she develops a fever 03/04/2021.

                                                From Dr.  notes from the patient&#39;s visit to the office on 02/08/2021:   &#34;*ACUTE CELLULITIS OF THE RIGHT UPPER ARM--I do believe that this is a result of the injection and not due to the vaccine itself. The fact that he continues to have some slight growth does necessitate that we treat this with an antibiotic. I am what have you TAKE TMP-SMX DS 1 tablet twice per day for 7 days. Elevate this arm and keep moist heat to this area and it should improve quickly. Call me if there is any worsening. I will CHECK COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT TODAY to evaluate this more fully.&#34;  Also from Dr. notes from the patient&#39;s visit to the office on 02/08/2021:   &#34;This fine lady comes in today stating that she received the CoVid 19 Moderna vaccine with the first dose on 2/2/21. The patient previously had a moderately severe case of CoVid 19 in late September and early October. She states that the vaccine did cause her to have severe chills for 2 days and then she started to develop an area of erythema near the injection site and this continued to progress. She called me on Friday in regards to this and then on Saturday it had continued to grow. We did have her husband demarcate the borders of the erythema and today it seems like she has had another further growth of an inch or so in most directions. The patient has a little tingling in this area but really has no significant pains and she denies any fevers since she had fever on Thursday night and Friday with a temperature of 102.&#34;

Fatigue lasted approximately 1 week; other side effects about 3 days.  2 days after injection, had a 3 by 6 inch red raised itchy welt appear about 2 inches from injection site.  Gradually faded over a one week period.  I had an allergy injection 2 weeks prior to Covid vaccine.  Contacted allergy doctor and we agreed to postpone next allergy injection until after second Moderna vaccine, in case there was a connection.

                                                In the evening lots of pain in left arm. during night chills including teeth chattering, pain all over, no sleep but slept through most of the next day, ate nothing.  Was quite concerning but did not call doctor although I sure thought about it. I was wondering if I was actually infected with Covid- 19. Shot was Tuesday 2: 30 PM, felt a bit better by Thursday but arm still hurt even on Friday arm was red and swollen down to my elbow. Saturday fine. I thought someone should know about this as lost of my friends also had difficult reactions. But this was the first time I saw an opportunity to respond.

                                                On the 9th day (Fri., 2/19) after my shot I developed a very intense rash all over my stomach, and on the underside of my breasts. It was very itchy.  I considered the possibility that it was the seafood soup I had eaten, but all day I also  had very bad pains in my lower back, left hip, and left knee. I had knee surgery in August, but this pain was much worse than I&#39;d had in months. The pain and rash continued thru the next day Sat., 2/20.  Then on Sunday the pain was completely gone, and the rash started to subside. Then the following weekend  (2/27 and 2/28) the rash had a mild flare-up, and there&#39;s mild itching off and on since them.

                                                Approximately 4 days after vaccine a large red area appeared around the injection site.  It was about the size of large lemon.  It was warm but not hot to the touch.  The initial reaction to the vaccine was redness about the size of a silver dollar, warm and tender for about 24 hours and then resolved.  The second occurrence was 4 days after the vaccine. We used ice packs and advil but the next day it was larger and redder and by 48 hours later it was quadrupled in size - roughly 8&#34; x5&#34;.  On  Friday afternoon 01/15/2021, we held a telemed conference with her internist.  She prescribed methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack for a total of 6 days beginning 01/16/2021, she also prescribed 7 days of 3x/day Cephalexin 500 mg, and Triamcinolone .1% cream.  She also recommended hot then cold alternating packs on the affected area and  using Tylenol or Ibuprofen several times a day.   On todays date 01/17/2021 the redness has faded probably 30 - 50% and it&#39;s size has shrunk 20% as well.   I observed my wife getting her vaccine from a nurse (I have no name) and although I could be wrong it was my impression she cotton swabbed with alcohol on  an upper a smallish area on the left arm (size of a quarter), but proceeded to give the injection just above the swabbed area ?..

                                                The morning of 1/20/21, I awoke with a very itchy, moderately reddened upper left arm.  Reddened, itchy area 3 inches X 5 inches, on outer aspect of L arm in Deltoid area.  I was given the vaccination injection within this same area.  The symptoms were worse Th. 1/21.  Called Dr.  He believes it is an allergic reaction.  Discomfort continues.  Only relieved by cold compress, ice pack.

                                                I received my injection on 1/25/2021 I had my second COVID shot, everything went well, I just had a little pain and swelling and was fine. About 7 hours later i got up from chair and i was dizzy and my balance was off and i almost fell into table. I didn&#39;t feel right. I went and sat back down and i was very tired and i started getting headache. I called my daughter and a nurse she knows told me to take extra strength Tylenol 500 mg take 2 every 6 hours. I started at 730 and went until 130. I slept on and off and got up Tuesday and my arm was still hurting. I was very tired and had no energy. When i got up later in the afternoon i had extreme chills. It was 83 degrees in Florida nd i turned heat up to 84 and i was still shaking. I got under covers and had a fever it was 100.8. Went to sleep that night and fever broke. Got up Wednesday and felt a little better, still had headache and tired. Decided to take a shower. I noticed my left arm where the injection was was all red. 6-7 inches long and about 5 inches wide which i never saw before. after shower I called my PCP I contacted the nurse said she thought it was normal and if there was no  change to call her back on Friday. my arm is still red and warm i went to sleep but couldn&#39;t sleep. I saw an article about COVID arm rash seen after Modern vaccine and now i know that&#39;s what I had. I feel better after I read it in the magazine today and it said it will only last a week. This should be listed as a side effect so nobody else wonders what it is. I drank so much water because it said to drink plenty of water and i tried to use arm as much as possible.

It is slowly going away but not completely gone as of 1/28/21 and was rechecked by doctor today.

                                                One week to day, January 28 , 2021, woke up with itching and huge swollen area on left arm  at injection area, area red and feverish. Health dep closed that day. Called them next morning, told to me call my primary care doctor. Went to doctor that day, told allergic reaction, put on 800 mg Motrin  every 8 hours plus a Zyrtec for pain and swelling.  Knot started going down, turning to fluid filling entire arm, into left breast. And under arm   Into back area.

It itched, became red, warm.  Starting to become lighter in color on 1/29/21.   Left message for Dr. he/she was not in on 1/28/21.  Still waiting for call back.  Hopefully it will go away.   Since it has not totally gone away, I said &#34;No&#34; to Item 20.

Today I put a cold compress on it and was surprised that as soon as I took it off after about 10 minutes it was still hot.  I am worried about having the 2nd shot in the same place.

My left  knee replacement felt like it was in a vise,  This  was a  short lived event with some residual feeling in the knee in the morning.   3 days after injection  10:00 pm 1/30/2021- I noticed a small rash on my left abdomen near the navel, this rash moved quickly to the left and soon covered entire left abdomen, moving to the groin area then down left inner thigh.  I took a Benazepril and went to bed. During the night I woke up several time with a strong pressure in left bowel area. Changing position seemed to help and went back to sleep. woke up about 5 am and checked the rash which was mostly gone except for the original spot where it began.  The rash and pressure seemed to be restricted to front left side below waist area. It is now 11:00 am 1/31/2021 and I am feeling fine, very little residual rash at initial site.   I had not read anything about delayed reactions as late as 3 1/2 days after the injection so wanted to report this event.

                                                Eight days after first Moderna injection, I developed a rash over a large area of my upper left arm starting just below the injection site.  It is red, warm, and burns/itches.  Now, on the second day of the rash, it is somewhat larger, and still burning/itching.  I saw my health provider the second day, and was told to treat it with ice, antihistamine, and Tylenol.  She said it is consistent with a delayed allergic response seen 5-9 days after Moderna injection.  I can&#39;t comment on my outcome, as this is only the second day.

Around it had some little smaller redness, not raised that were blotchy all over.  It was a little itchy and when she touched it it was a little warm.  It was not a real bad reaction, but did not feel sick just the redness.  The next day it itched more and took a Benadryl, and about 2 days later it started to fade, but did merge together and got lighter and lighter in color and is almost completely gone.  it is not itching anymore and is light pink.

Got up in the middle of the night and had dry heaves, went back to bed and was okay.  Her arm got really red, hot and blisters all over it like a sunburn.  It is down to about the size of a half dollar today.  The blisters burst and have made places, is still warm and sore and looks like it is drying up.  Did look like a severe sunburn.  She ran a little fever until Thursday night 2/18/21.  The arm is still sore to touch today, 2/22/21.  She took some Tylenol the night her fever was 103, then it went to 101.   The fatigue is diminishing, she has slept a lot, but wonders if her arm is ever going to be right.

Only other new exposure was going to be pewter day prior to symptoms and eating popcorn but she has had this in the past with no problems Suggest we stated before that this is a reaction to Moderna Covid vaccine I would suggest she not get it in the future if able to We will treat with oral prednisone and continue antihistamines.  Also use ice packs , oatmeal baths and calamine to help with itching She will call or portal if symptoms or not improving.

Mostly it is just a rash about the size of a golf ball or a bit larger.  It showed up about 8-9 days after injection.  I have been putting cortisone 10 cream on it for the itching and it helps some but not completely.

                                                Moderna COVID19 Vaccine EUA I received the first injection on Feb. 13, 11:00. Because I am very thin, I wasn&#39;t too worried when my arm was sore for a couple of days, but on the 6th day, I was awakened at night with an intense itch at the injection site, and in the morning I saw an egg-shaped and egg-sized bright red area and it was swollen. I contacted my doctor on line, and she recommended hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl, which I have been doing for three days. The red patch has calmed down to light pink, but it&#39;s still sore and a bit swollen. It&#39;s been two weeks since the injection and I&#39;m scheduled for the second injection on March 13. I&#39;m concerned that the reaction will be worse next time.

Then on the 25th my arm started to itch in the injection area and when I looked the red hive was there again and is still there today (the 26th).  It is about the size of a silver dollar.  It has been a week since my injection.  I have not contacted my Dr. but will if it is still there on Monday.

From slightly painful first 2 days to just a little itchy by 5 day- today.  Painful arm a few hours after injection, which mostly ebbed, with the redness starting about 7-8 days after injection, becoming somewhat tender, with that ebbing by 5 day.  On third day ( 8 days after vaccine) Urgent care diagnosed it as a seondary infection and prescribed doxycycline.   Dr. said had never seen anything like it.  Took the antibiotic for 2 days and stopped.  Med seemed to make no difference.

                                                I have no known allergies.   On February 20th, eight (8) days after first (1st) dose injection on February 12, an inflamed, itchy rash measuring about four (4) inches in diameter appeared around the injection site, on left arm.  It is now seventeen (17) days since the injection and although the  rash is much smaller, measuring about 1.5-2.0 inches in diameter,  it is still itching on and off.  I am due for the second (2nd) Covid dose in 11 days.  I do not know what to expect with the 2nd dose.

                                                Started out with waking the next day a fullness in her head, but kind of a headache, and very tired.  Then a couple of hours later she got a severe case of the chills.  She laid down and slept on and off for about 5 hours.  When she got up she took her temperature and it was 101.  She also had body aches in her back and her legs felt very heavy.  She then noticed a rash on her body from a line that went underneath her breast, and redness on the left side of her breast to her belly button, all red around the belly button.   When she realized she had a fever she took Tylenol.  The rash by Saturday was fading and she also had diarrhea on Saturday, persistent diarrhea.  She felt almost normal except that she was tired.  Today, 3/1/21 she has the returned diarrhea, doesn&#39;t k now if it was related to the vaccine.  She spoke to a nurse yesterday, and she told that she had a typical side effect from the vaccine.  She was not sure if the diarrhea was from the vaccine.

                                                7 days after my shot I work up with a very sore arm and it was itchy. I saw a large oval reddish flat rash, approximately 3 by 4 inches at site where I got my Covid shot. It remained sore and itchy for about two days. The rash went from red to pink and took 13 days before it went away, actually I can still see the outline of it as I go into my 14 th day. I treated the early symptoms with ice and an antihistamine cream for the first three days.

                                                I had no reaction to the first shot , except sore arm for one day.  After the 2nd shot, the next day I developed a high fever (103) and chills.  I called urgent care that evening to see how to bring the fever down.  They told me that was my body building antibodies.  The fever &#34;broke&#34; later that night.  I never have gotten rid of the chills.  I did not see a doctor for this reaction. During this time, not exactly sure of the dates, the cardiologist started me on a new medicine - Verapamil.   I thought the chills might be from the medicine.  She reduced the dosage due to low heart rate, and I&#39;m still taking the medicine.   I now have a rash on my side and on my left thigh, which is blotchy, red, and itchy.  I do not know if these reactions are from the medicine or from the vaccine, but I suspect it is the Moderna vaccine.  The chills are mostly centered in my legs.  They are not letting up.  I have not seen my doctor about the rash yet.  I have had the rash for a couple of weeks, trying to get rid of it myself.

Upon awakening early on the morning of the second, I had moderate aching in all joints, headache, weakness and fatigue. I stayed quiet for day. Upon getting ready to shower on the morning of the 3rd I found I was covered with an angry bright red rash from my neck down to my knees both front and back. Because I did not shower on the 2nd of March I have no idea when it began. On Thursday my head still felt pressure but felt a little stronger and that evening I again showered and the rash looked less angry and bright. Waking this morning on Friday the 5th the rash is gone and I am feeling much better except for soreness in the armpit of the right arm that received the injection.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

Then I didn&#39;t worry about till the 01/18/2021 in the evening and it felt warm and it was a big patch of red (looked like a rash) about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide like a oval shape. On Tuesday 01/19/2021 I called my doctor,  spoke with nurse what was going on. Doctor told her to put cold compresses on the site 15 minutes on and then 15 minutes off and take Tylenol as needed. The area is still warm and the redness area is still there.    Did go to local grocery store and spoke with pharmacist who advised her to contact VAERS.

Pt advised any worsening sx, including SOB, itch or swelling airways should prompt immediate ER visit. Likely a brisk localized immune response/injection site reaction.  Less likely true allergy to some component vaccine or injector, but degree of discomfort bit concerning.  We have asked pt to discuss second dose with PCP and vaccine provider.

I took Benadryl, Claritin and Pepcid ( these were meds previously recommended for my daughters allergies). It took about 30 mins after the meds to be able to swallow comfortably without coughing. The rash however lasted three weeks. I has a telemedicine consult with my allergist who was hesitant to advise the second shot.

Ignored it but the redness started to spread on the arm, started feeling firmer, decide to see doctor.  Saw him on 1/22/21, who felt like some of the bacteria got under the skin and put her on Benadryl and Doxycycline.  It&#39;s a lot lighter as far as redness, and not as firm but redness is spreading 4-5&#34; across the arm.

She did have a routine doctors apt on 1/22/21 and her physician completed bloodwork, unsure of labs or results. Her physician said that she should report her symptoms after the vaccine.

On eve of 1/25 I looked at arm and it seemed normal. Next morning, January 26 i looked at arm and red vertical rash and quite itchy. Emailed Dr he said if it became larger or more itchy we might need to treat with steroid cream.  Since I had some hydrocortisone cream i put some on at bedtime and again morning of 1/17.  Took pictures morning of 1/27 also.

                                                One week after my injection on 1/15/21, on the evening of Friday 1/22, my left arm felt warm, was reddened, somewhat swollen and itchy. It has continued for the past 5 days, with the itching and reddening decreasing a little bit each day.  I was surprised that this reaction occurred a full week after vaccination. Should I still take the 2nd dose?

Now 9 days later the rash is now 3 1/2&#34; x 3&#34;, still hot to touch.  Local doctor said to take benadryl and use warm compresses.  This has not helped and the site is getting larger.

At approximately 7 days post injection she began to have another localized reaction that included reddness, swelling, pain, heat, and a dry skin tecture that progressed to cover the lateral aspect of upper left arm from shoulder to elbow. At time of examination by RN, the patient reports that size and intensity have been increasing for about 7 days.  Patient finds relief in hot shower.  No other treatments attempted at time of exam. Patient reported area may be improving, but she is unsure.   Area was outlined with marker by RN and patient was advised to see PCP for treatment if area increased in size and was not continuing to improve.  Counseled on using OTC benadryl cream if there was itching.

Approximately 3 days later, she noted a bump that was sore to touch and slightly itchy.  It slowly got better.  She did apply clobetasol ointment on January 24 and 25.  It seemed better.  On January 28 the evening and 8 noticed some redness.  She saw me, her doctor, on January 29.  She had a 7 x 7 cm round pink area that was slightly warm and minimally tender.  This was at the site of injection.  It was slightly swollen. I did not give her the vaccine.  She got it through the health Department.

                                                After administration of the Covid-19 vaccine I had 2-3 days of chills, muscle aches, fatigue, sore arm.  Symptoms gradually went away.  Then about the  7th day I started experiencing an itchy arm and a 6 inch circle of intense red at the injection site, with a wide band of white surrounding it, that itched unbelievably, was hot and swollen.  That lasted for several days, then began to subside and now is only slightly red, itches some and is no longer swollen or hot.   My question is:  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose, after experiencing this kind of reaction?

The red circle is large.  I have a picture to send you.  Fever of 102 the first night, no fever now.  Not sure if it&#39;s infection or from the vaccine itself but today is the 4th  at 4:45 pm and she got the vaccine on the 1st at 1:30 pm.  I have  yet to taken her to the doctors for the increased swelling because I caused the covid vaccine number and a vaccine specialist said this could be normal and to watch it.  I have a picture it looks BIG!

                                                I had my second Maderna shot at 10:30 am. No problem with my first one three weeks ago. At 10:00 pm I started to get extremely cold and could not get warm. At 10:45 my upper body started shaking very, very bad. I couldn&#39;t control the shaking and my teeth were chattering.  I had to lay down and put my arms under my body to keep them from shaking and I was so cold even though I was wearing warm things and under a comforter.  The shaking lasted an hour and a half. I took my temperature  during the night and it was 102. I am very week this morning, temp. is 99.9.  I was expecting the temperature and pain in the injection site but I can&#39;t find out anywhere on line whether the uncontrollable shaking was normal for the second shot.  .

                                                The patient was administered the Moderna  Covid-19 vaccine on 1/14/2021. The patient reported experiencing arm pain around the injection site during the 2 days following the vaccination. The patient reported experiencing hip pain and trouble with her legs on 1/21/2021. On 1/22/2021 the patient reported not being able to stand without bracing. The patient visited a doctor on 1/25/2021 and there was suspicion for inflammation of the spinal cord leading to the patient being prescribed prednisone for 6 days. The patient visited the doctor again on 2/2/21 and another course of prednisone was initiated. The patient reports that she can stand from a sitting position without help getting up about half the time and that she had no such trouble standing prior to the vaccination. The patient returned to the second vaccination clinic on 2/11/2021, which was  4 weeks after receiving the first dose, to report her symptoms. The patient was not administered the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

It itched so much and anything I put on it to stop the itch didn&#39;t help.  I have taken 3 single pill doses of Benedryl which has eased the itch but it has not gone away as yet. (2/17) I have not taken Benedryl yet today but will have to, I think.

We made a follow up call on 2-8-21 and at that time pt. reported some soreness at the injection site, but otherwise felt fine. On Feb. 17th at 10:30, pt. called to report that 3 days ago (on 2-14-21) that the pt. noticed an area approximately 3&#34; x  3&#34; that looked to have a rash, as well as extreme itching, redness, warmth to the touch, and &#34;slightly puffy&#34;.  Symptoms continue today, but pt. advises that area is getting better other than the itching.

On Day 3, it was still a bit sore, but improving. On Day 4, I was totally fine.

                                                Evening of 1/28 I started feeling fatigue, muscle aching, stomach upset and headache which lasted till next day around noon.  Then was fine for 7 days.  On 2/5/2021, I went to get my B12 shot and asked the doctor to check left arm where Moderna shot was given as it was itching and a bit sore at the same time.  He told me I was having reaction.  By evening, a third of my arm around injected area was swollen an had red rash.  Then same symptoms of fatigue, etc. came back and I was in and out of bed for the next three days....then at end had a bout of diarrhea.

It crawled. NOTE;  I HAVE GOTTEN THIS SAME RASH OVER THE LAST 15  YEARS.  THE RASH COULD BE FROM AN OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUG AT ONE TIME AND NOT HAPPEN AGAIN THE NEXT TIME THE DRUG IS TAKEN.  THAT IS TRUE FOR ANTI-BIOTICS; I.E. RASH AT ONE TIME, BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE NEXT.  I HAVE BEEN EXAMINED BY AN ALLERGIST FOR THIS AND SHE FOUND NOTHING THAT SHE COULD DIAGNOSE (AFTER COMPLETING SKIN TESTS OF MEDICATIONS)

                                                36 Hours following the vaccine shot, I noticed a number of dark spots under my arms and on my back. A trip to the Dermatologist on Monday 2/15/2021 determined that the vaccine had caused most if not all of the Seborrheic Keratoses (SK&#39;s) skin growths on my body to change color to a blue color. Four or the SK&#39;s were removed and sent to the lab for biopsy. The result came back as irritated SK&#39;s but no mention was made of the discoloration. After one week Friday (2/19), the blue color began to fade and by Sunday (2/20) the smaller of the SK&#39;s had returned to their original color while the larger still retain some of the blue color. During this time I felt fine.

                                                Four days after injection right foot became inflamed and hugely swollen.  Top of foot and all along the outside side of it both on top and at bottom of foot all very painful. Ankle and leg very swollen and painful. Can&#39;t walk on foot.  As of 2/26/2021  swelling is not as bad and not so discolored but still some swelling and redness burning and very painful and still cannot use the foot.  Also have noticed places where  I have had surgery or injuries is hurting and being stiff. Am questioning whether or not I should get the 2nd shot. Concerned it will make situation even worse.

                                                Same adverse effects as first short: fever of 101.6 which has slowly been going down, fluctuating, but  today, 6th day after shot fever still 99.6.  I have felt chills and sweats, lethargic, achy, today sore throat.  Below site of shot had large bright pink 3inch circle very hot for first few days.  I&#39;m hoping the temperature stabilizes soon.  It took 8 days to stabilize after first shot.  My second shot&#39;s effects are the same as the first short.  By the way, I suffered through Covid for 3-4 weeks from last midMarch through early April and I do still have antibodies and presume that is why I had the reaction to the first shot but I wasn&#39;t expecting the same for the second.  I had also read in a magazine that people with antibodies didn&#39;t need the 2nd shot, however, my Dr. recommended that I get it. Treatment: I took Tylenol for the fever and aches.  I was finally better after first shot in 8 days.  I am not completely recovered yet from the second but I am confident I will have recovered completely in  a few days.

                                                After the second shot, I expected mild side effects and experienced some: mild headache, sore left arm around injection site, fatigue, brain fog. I was walking to my garage with a small package of papers when suddenly my lower back spasmed sharply. The pain was intense. I thought it would subside so I managed, with difficulty, to make it into my car. When I was seated in the car, the spasms subsided. I considered not driving to my two errands but decided that I felt well enough seated in the car to drive and deliver the papers to my tax preparer  and the carful of donations to Goodwill. At the tax office, I called an assistant to come to the parking lot to pick up the papers, which she did. At Goodwill, one of the attendants emptied my car. When I got home at about 10:50, I had to call my husband to help me into the house. I spent the next several hours in agony (11 on a scale of 1-10) with spasms, punctuated by absolutly not moving. The spasms were so bad I could not breathe. My doc prescribed a muscle relaxer, then the next day prednisone, which has helped. Today I will have an mri to determine if the spasms herniated a disc.

As of today the left leg is clear and the right leg still looks red according to the husband. Recommended to follow up with PCP.

                                                I have a rather large welt on my right arm surrounding the vaccination site - about 3 inches by 8 inches or so.  It looks like a hive.  I only noticed it when it began to itch.  The site is a bit sore and still itches four days after onset.  I have been taking Tylenol for it which seems to help.  Is this really a &#34;rare&#34; reaction so long after receiving the vaccination?  Just curious.

Woke up this morning and the chills were gone and I feel great.

Everything was good except my blood pressure dropped. I was not taken to the hospital.

                                                About 9 days after my 1st dose of Moderna vaccine, I began to have itching on my right upper arm in the area of the injection.  That continues today.  Two days after I noticed the itching, the upper arm was hot to the touch, red, and swollen.  The area is about 6&#34; in diameter.  I did not have an elevated temperature, but I felt slightly nauseous and light-headed on March 5.    I had no reaction to the shot until a week and a half to two weeks after the injection.   I still have a red, itchy area on my right arm.  It seems to be slowly improving.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 04-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown), intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Feb-2021, approximately 48 hours after vaccination, the patient developed allergic reaction and had hives all over her body. The patient received diphenhydramine for hives. The patient also stated that inside of her was burning, face swelled up, lips swelled up and throat swelled up. The patient rushed to emergency room (ER). They needed to take the patient to an allergist because they wanted to find out if this was related to the vaccine. The allergist told her that they couldn&#39;t do an allergy testing. The patient asked if there were any reports on people showing allergic reaction 48 hours later after the vaccine. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, allergic reaction, hives all over her body, face swelled up, lips swelled up, throat was swelled up, and burning, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The next day I had a steroid injection in both knees , the day after the steroid,  my injection site and shoulder were fine. Also I had the hot flashes and flushes. Possibly from steroid, or the vaccine, is the steroid masking the reaction to the vaccine? Will the steroid negate the effects of the vaccine on my immune system?

                                                on 1/13/21 after the shot and stayed at rest area for 15 minutes, as we went outside , walking to the parking lot, I noticed a distinctive stinging pain on back of my right hand below thumb, I saw puff veins and a quarter-size lump that was very painful.  I took Tylenol and put on my arm-wrist wrap wrapping overnight, it started to get warm and red the next two day.  I called my primary physician  on Monday 1/18/21 and have a victual visit for 15minutes at 3PM. It is getting better as of now on 1/19/21.

                                                2 weeks after injection my right arm has started to itch and has an oval red area starting  2 inches above injection down to elbow. It is very warm to the touch and itchy. All my initial side effects went away by about the 5th day and this has reoccurred. I am scheduled for  second shot 2/2/2021. Is this a normal reaction and should I get second vaccine. I have called  Dr but have not heard back yet.

                                                Got the vaccine and nothing for a week. On 01/18/2021 I woke up that morning and I had a red spot that itched really bad at the injection site. Round area about 3 inches in diameter. I have tried different things to control the itch, took a baking soda bath, what works the best has been wetting a bar of soap and rubbing it on the area until it leaves a white paste on the area and then leaving it to dry.   Has left a message for doctor and has not received a call back.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 05 Jan 2021, the patient woke up real sweaty at 3 am. She got up and went to the bathroom and passed out. The patient reported that she fell on the commode then got to the floor because she felt weak and could not walk. Once she regained her strength, she returned to bed.   On 07 Jan 2021, the patient reported that her arm was still sore at the injection site and continued to feel weak. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The events, passed out, sweaty, and couldn&#39;t walk were considered resolved on 06 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, felt weak and arm still sore at the left arm injection site, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 80-year-old female patient  with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Loss of consciousness, the non-serious listed event of Injection site pain, and the non-serious unlisted events of Asthenia, Hyperhidrosis, and Gait disturbance.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events on the day after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

Patient reports that spot on arm was painful. patient reports that arm was sore shortly after vaccination but that soreness had resolved a couple days after vaccination until this spot appeared then pain returned. Patient is under the care of doctor. I advised patient to contact doctor to notify him of reaction and to let him advise her on how to treat reaction.

SUBSIDED OVER A PERIOD OF 72&#43; HOURS.  1 WEEK LATER THE SEVERE SORE/STIFF SITUATION REAPPEARED, COULD NOT TAKE MY NIGHTGOWN OFF THE NEXT MORNING AND COULD NOT PUT A SEATBELT ON OR DRIVE, DRY MYSELF AFTER A SHOWER, ETC.... THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

Then I noticed a  redness on right arm at site of shot, a circular redness.  This has stayed the same since the 27th.  Once in a while it has been a little itchy and warm to the touch.  Also a little touch produces a little tenderness.  No treatment yet.  Will call primary care physician on 2/01/21 if still red.

Arm was so sore after injection she could barely move her arm. She was also extremely tired for two days after getting the vaccine.

                                                Had reaction in November to tetanus vaccine.  Had flu vaccine with no reaction.  Then had this vaccine, no reaction initially, came home, feeling fine but an hour later had flushing in her left ear, just creeping over to her eye and the side of her face.  This lasted for about 15 minutes and left the feeling of something not quite right around her eye.  Nothing compared to her reaction in November from a tetanus booster.  Still has the feeling but not an adverse reaction.  Then at 10:00 PM all of a sudden her face went really hot, and presumed she had a fever, started feeling badly.  Started walking around the house, took Tylenol.  That feeling lasted for about 30 minutes and resolved.  Went to bed and did not feel anything but a funny feeling.  All symptoms have subsided except for a weird feeling around her eye.

Awoke this morning with itchy, red rash on upper left arm about 3-4 inches in length and 1 1/2 inches wide..Area is also warm to the touch with some swelling. It is not at injection site, but on front of upper arm. I have no fever. Initially I thought perhaps I had a bug bite, but on doing some searching on the internet found a reported phenomenon of &#34;Covid Vaccine Arm&#34; that occurs about 7-8 days after injection. I think that this may be what is occurring with me. I have cleansed the area and have been applying cortisone cream to relieve the itching.  I have had no other symptoms today.  Please note that I am registered with v-safe and have completed the daily check-ins through yesterday 2/3/2021. I did not receive a text check in today and am assuming I am now on the weekly check in schedule.

Within 7 days it became itchy red and swollen.  Pt contacted her PCP on 2/3/2021 and she was told to take an antihistamine but she didnt take it since she has dry eyes.  She used hydrocortisone to help with the itching.

                                                After having NO reaction for 8 days, I experienced a slightly itchy rash at vaccination site. It lasted for about 2 days. It was slightly warmer than surrounding area.  Comment: Not sure if vaccine was properly administered. It was almost half-way down to my elbow, possibly in the tricep area. I mentioned it to my nurse practitioner during a telemed visit which had  been scheduled before my vaccination. When I showed her photo of my arm with the bandaid, she thought it might not have been placed high enough on the arm. Based on location, not sure if subcutaneous or intramuscular.

Used cool compresses, area increased in size (2 inch oval to a 3 inch circle)  and continued through Feb 14 and 15, decreasing in intensity and size by February 16 AM.  Attempted to contact Health Department who administered vaccine.  Due to weekend and holiday, did not get anyone to talk with.  My concern is getting the second dose.  Please advise.

                                                Two weeks after receiving the vaccine, the site developed redness and intense itching. The red area was approximately the size of a quarter. The doctor recommended using Benadryl ointment and cool compresses, which I did. The site returned to normal in about 10 days.

This then spread down her arm 2-3&#34;.  Did not have pain or soreness.  She went to the ER and the doctor looked at it, and she told her that she did not know if it was a reaction to the vaccine or if the are was not cleaned up right.  She then put her on an antibiotic and told her to see her doctor.  She FU with the PA and he didn&#39;t give her any further instructions.  The area has residual pinkness, warm to touch, warmer than the rest of the arm, but not much.

The area does not really itch, but is just red.  For the first two days, the rash didn&#39;t move.  Then over the next several days, the rash starting spreading down the upper arm. On February 18, the patient experienced bad diarrhea.  On February 21, the patient put a cold damp cloth over the area to soothe the area.  Some areas within the rash are improving, but the redness continues to spread down the arm.  The area felt like a bad sunburn, and the patient put some salve on it one day, but did not notice a difference.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

The area affected was approximately  7 inches by 5 inches and was like that for almost three days. For the last two days it has been itching in that area,still is on and off. I did not take any medications for it. I did apply ice packs to the area fairly regularly and even heat a few times.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Six days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I noticed a rash on my left arm near the location of the shot. By the next day, the rash had spread to cover most of my upper arm as a large hive that itched badly. As of today, February 26, the large hive has not gone away and the entire area is itchy and painful. I called Dr. who  prescribed Benadryl gel for the itching and recommended that I keep my appointment for the second dose of the vaccine. He said that the reaction was not uncommon.

However, on the 9th day after the vax, I got &#34;COVID Arm&#34; which included upper arm swelling, red, itchy and achey at the vax site and another few days of extreme fatigue.  Today (18 days after vax) I am no longer fatigued, felt good when I woke up and I am finally getting some energy back.  The redness, swelling and itching is subsiding but is not gone totally and there is only a slight discomfort in my arm.  Moderna Vaccination #2 is on March 11 and it will be in my other arm.  Only took Aleve twice for pain.

                                                Received Moderna shot at 2PM on January 12,2021.  On January 21 around 10AM my upper left arm was itching.  upon further investigation of the area I noticed a good size red oval patch on my upper left arm located approximately 1 inch above the site of my Moderna injection site.  It was slightly itchy and was hot to the touch.  I had no fever and felt perfectly fine.  The area was not sore.  I applied an anti-itch cream and placed an inquiry with my personal doctor.  His office sent a response this morning advising me to notify the provider.  There was no information on my COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card of who to notify and I could not get through to them on their phone which is constantly busy with people calling for appointments.  I did see info saying to report adverse reactions on line at vaers.hhs.gov which is what I am doing.  My concern is whether or not I should get the second shot.

                                                Left arm around the vaccine shot site became extremely itchy and very red. The site expanded on the next day (Friday, the 22nd), and by Sat. it was swollen. Sunday the swelling subsided and the redness expanded around my arm. By Monday the redness had moved down my arm with the upper part clearing. Tuesday the new site had swelling, and today it is not swollen but continues to be red and a little itchy. It was my only reaction with no fever but a little tiredness. (not adverse event, but just reporting my reaction to vaccine...)

                                                Starting on 1/22/21 her arm started to itch, got red circle around injection site about a quarter size, warm and hard in that area.  On 1/23/21, started to put warm compresses x 3, Sunday the same thing and by Monday it had dissipated and was fine.  Then last night 1/29/21, about 1:30 AM got up as she was not sleeping well, took two Aleve.  Woke up this morning with arm itching, red again and kind of warm.  Feels fine but that location has reappeared from the initial injection.  Pink in color and warm to touch.

                                                1st dose of Covid vaccine was administered on 1-13-2021, eight days later on 1-21-2021 patient went to her Rock Steady Boxing class for her Parkinson&#39;s, she noticed that her arm was itching at the injection site on her right arm.  When looked at it there was a red streak about 3 inches long and at least 1 inch wide radiating down from the injection site there were also hives in the red area.  Since then patient has experienced an itching that started in her head and the itching radiates down to the injection site, this has happened a couple times.  Then most recently patient has had itching all over her body, as of 1-29-2021 the redness and hives around injection site while not as red has spread it&#39;s about 6 to 7 inches long by 4 inches wide.  She has called her Doctors office the nurse there told her to call the County Health Dept who administered the vaccine.  I spoke with someone at HD on 1-29-2021 on behalf of patient (my Mom) as she was having problems reaching a person to speak with.  She told me that we needed to report to V-Safe the reactions she is having and that she would need to call her Doctor,  as they could not give recommendations on whether she should have the 2nd vaccination she is scheduled to get on 2-10-2021.  That Doctor should advise her if she should get the 2nd vaccination.  She is calling her Doctors office again on Monday.  In the mean time since this all started she has been taking Benadryl and also using hydrocortizone on the area of skin that is red and has hives around the injection site.

This lasted about 5 minutes and then subsequently resolved.  She then got up to leave and again began feeling the left chest pain, diaphoresis, and again lasting about 5 to 6 minutes and then subsequently resolving.  She does state a history of anxiety but did take Xanax this morning preventatively.  However, she states she has had similar pains in her chest over the past month.  She states these are not necessarily associated with any exertion and seemed to be somewhat better after antacids.  She notes she has not had anything to eat or drink this morning which is not unusual for her and her blood sugar was 117 this morning.

Throughout the day, I experienced swelling and more redness that surrounded the injection site. The size around the injection area was about 3 inches.  I called the place where I received the vaccination and was told it could be the Delayed Cutaneous Hypersensitivity that is known to occur in some patients 5 to 9 days after the vaccination. I received the injection on 01/20/2021.  I was told to apply an ice pack and/or take Tylenol for pain.  The swelling was resolved in two days.

                                                Immediately after the injection, I experienced an irregular small light red patch at the injection site about 3 inches by 2 inches.  I had pain and mild itching at the injection  site for two days and then the pain and itching stopped and the red patch faded.  Seven days later, in the evening of February 9th,  the red patch returned  and it was darker and became larger - round, about 3 inches across.  It was slightly swollen and warm to the touch.  It was accompanied by intense itching, but no pain.  This skin reaction has been lasting for two days now.  My doctor, by phone, recommended Benadryl but I don&#39;t have that in the house and we&#39;re having a snow storm and I can&#39;t go out to get it.  I took Extra Strength Tylenol before bed last night and it relieved the itching.

                                                My arm was sore almost immediately after receiving the vaccine. About 3-4 days later my arm started itching. The itches goes down from my shoulder to my elbow on my left arm and my right arm the itching goes from the shoulder to the wrist. My  left arm is also red around the area where I got the shot and was swollen, this lasted about 2-3 days then it went away. In the last couple of days the redness came back and puffiness came back. I do not see any bumps but when I feel my arms they bumps. I did try to put some anti-itch cream which helped with the itching but I quit putting the cream on it as I worried if it would react with the vaccine.

The pain in my arm continued  throughout the 12th and 13th necessitating being on pain relievers. By the evening of the 13th , a 3&#34; red swollen area became apparent .  The pain continued which was annoying but did not limit my activities .   I remain puzzled as to why I responded as I did when I hadn&#39;t before; it almost appears I have a cystitis issue now.

The second day she shaking and jerking, couldn&#39;t hold on to anything.  Her blood pressure was up and down that day. She said she felt like she was dying and then she vomiting where she bruised both elbows on the toilet bowl due to the jerking movement she was experiencing.  She took a nap and woke up confused.  She was hallucinating saying she felt like she went from a small box to a blue box to red box and didnt recognize her room.  Her sitter said her eyes were glazed but was able to recognize her sitter at that time.  Blood pressure dropped so the sitter then called EMTs where they checked her out.  Vital signs were good but she declined to be transported to the hospital via ambulance.  The third day she was feeling some better where she was able to eat and get a sponge bath.  Fourth day she was better so was able to shower.  She states she is better now with just a little soreness and redness around the injection site.   Pt has contacted her PCP and spoke with the nurse about her symptoms.

                                                The patient presented today at counselling for an antibiotic. The patient stated she was seen today in the ER today for a rash she developed on her arm where she received the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago. The patient stated she started itching on her right deltoid 4 days ago and since then the rash has progressed down and around her bicep. The patient stated that the rash was not painful and therefore, the doctor did not think it was cellulitis but prescribed the antibiotic just in case. I thanked the patient for letting me know and I informed her that I would be reporting the reaction to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

That night I didn&#39;t sleep at all. So that night I called the doctor and I went to the doctor Friday morning, and was diagnosed with the worst case of Shingles she had ever seen. She prescribed prednisone on a taper, Valtrex (generic) 1 gram tablet 3x daily for one week, and topical ointment (flutisone propionate) .005 strength twice daily, and 500 mg tylenol every six hours.

The pain started around 2/19/21 and has improved but still present. On 2/28/21 patient noticed a red rash about the size of a half dollar at the injection site. She had not looked at site prior and is unsure if rash was present earlier. Patient asked me to report to VAERS as she does not have internet access and would prefer not to make the phone call herself.

Client reports that the rash is itchy and red.  Denies blisters or s/s of infection.  I advised her to notify her PCP and seek treatment if indicated.  She also reported eating an egg on 01/21/2021- She states that she doesn&#39;t eat eggs often and has not had any problems with them in the past.

It is warm to the touch and is firmer that the areas not affected.  It itches a little but has not caused and other symptoms or problems.  I started to rub the area and it seems to grow bigger like there is a pocket of liquid just under the skin.

On Jan 18, 2021, developed a circular rash, approx 3? long and1 and 1/2? wide in vicinity of the vaccination.  Rosy colored, warm with a hard spot in the middle.  Painful at first, then itchy.  Rash began fading slightly next day, Jan 19, and became itchy but not painful.  Lasted several days, continuing to fade and become less itchy.   By Jan 23, just very mild pink discoloration and very mildly sensitive to the touch.  Then disappeared all together.  The entire episode resembled something like a bee bite.

Day 3: 01/09/21   Left arm slightly sore (no action taken).  Days 4-9: 01/10/21 to 01/15/21 No side effects noted.  Day 10: 01/16/21 (T:98.0) Woke up to a large welt, hot to the touch, no pain on upper left arm - below injection site.  Began 25mg Benadryl (25 mg) 2 doses taken.  Day 11: 01/17/21 (T:98.2) Welt increasing, hot to the touch, slight burning on back of neck also.  Took Benadryl (25mg) twice during the day and Tylenol (650 mg) twice during the day. Day 12: 01/18/21 (T:98.0) Rash seems to be flattening out spreading a little, neck rash seems slightly worse. Burns. Day 13: 01/19/21 (T:98.6) No change in symptoms Took Benadryl (25mg) twice  Day 14: 01/20/21 (T:98.3) Rash seems to be spreading into the armpit area. Neck area is larger and burning.  Took three Benadryl (25mg) during the day-Tylenol                    2 tabs (650 mg) at bedtime.                                                            Day 15: 01/21/21 (T:98.3) feeling tired. Rash is spreading under both armpits and neck. Back seems to be itching a lot too.  Took Benadryl (25mg) three times. Day 16: 01/22/21 (T:98.6) Rash is really bad!  Area of original welt is slightly larger. Took Benadryl (25mg) 6 am, 12pm, 6pm 10, pm and 3am. Will call MD on Monday. Used Shea Butter lotion (little help). Day 17: 01/23/21 (T:98.0) Rash is worse, both arms and larger neck areas hot to the touch burning sensation. Benadryl (25mg) 6:30 am. (37.5mg)10:30sm, (37.5                    mg) 3:30 pm, (25mg.) 8:30 pm. 2 Tylenol (650 mg.) 9:00 pm.  Day 18: 01/24/21 (T:98.8) Rash is still worse and spreading (will call MD tomorrow). Benadryl (25 mg) 6:30 am and 11: 45 am, 2 tabs of Tylenol (650 mg)                  noon and 4:00 pm. Shea butter lotion not helping. Applied ice, seemed to ease burning sensation but still miserable. Day 19: 01/25/21 (T:98.4) Saw Dr.  who prescribed RX: Prednisone 60 mg daily for 5 days, Benadryl 25-50 mg for itching, oatmeal baths, cortisone 1% cream or lotion, I picked up my RX and a new package of Benadryl/Banophen. Went home and took Benadryl (50 mg) 2 tablets at 9:30 am,1:30 pm and 5:15 pm, mistakenly believing they were 25mg tabs because of packaging change and miniscule text on bottle and difficult to find directions.

                                                Patient had a sore arm and achiness for 2-3 days after the shot, but then a week later on 2/10/21, she developed a hard knot at the site that was red.  The red coloring has intensified today, 2/11/21, and the knot is palpable to the touch.  She is also running a low grade fever that she was not running before.  Patient is concerned there may have been something in the vaccine that caused her an allergic reaction.

                                                I had my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Feb. 10, 2021. I had about three days of chills, aches, headache, very sore arm. etc. On Feb. 22,2021 a red area  about 3 or 4 inches around the site of the injection was noticed. It was itchy and uncomfortable. I spoke to my internist and allergist. There is some disagreement about whether I should take the second dose.  I have taken benadryl and tylenol. Both doctors said it was unusual for such a reaction 2 days after receiving the vaccine. What information do you have about rashes occurring so long after the vaccination? What is the recommendation about the second vaccine? Thank you.

Used Calamine lotion.  It was semi-effective for a short duration.  If scratched, the skin would turn blotchy and red.   24 hours later purchased OTC antihistamine which provided relief for 24 hours.   I took the antihistamine again the second 24 hours.  The itching didn&#39;t return after that.

By the next day it was and itchy red area about 4 to 5 inches long and two inches wide.  Gradually went away until 23 February when I awoke with a pinkness in the area where the red patch had been plus a red line around that area and including  an extended bit below it maybe 2&#34; long and 1&#34; wide.  Hard to explain.  I have photos if you should wish.

Dr there glanced at my arm and said it was an infection  and gave me antibiotic, Cephalexin 500mg, 10 days.  Feel really bad but maybe better today and that  is after tramadol and tylenol. Headaches. Tylenol helps.. now afraid to take 2nd shot.

                                                Had a red rash/spot come on left arm at injection site nine (9) days after injection date.  It started about 2-1/2 inches x 3-1/2 inches and has grown to about 3 inches x 4 inches (maybe little more).  It has a darker red rim around it and has become lighter in the center .  It is a little bumpy where it grows and gets more red.  It might itch a little--not much.  I have been putting hydrocortisone cream on it.  My concern is that it is getting larger.

                                                Eight days after the first injection, I noticed for the first time a reddish blotch near the site of the injection.  The day after it had spread downward, the next day the redness seems to have diminished some, but it still covers the same area.   The redness was warm to the touch, and hard,  but not painful.  The area felt like the size of the palm of my hand.  I did not run a fever.  I realize that redness is one of the side effects, but my concern is that it didn&#39;t occur immediately; rather, one week later.

                                                Last evening I experienced severe itching at the injection site, I applied a benedryl lotion to the injection site, but no relief.  I took a 20mg benedryl and went to bed.  I woke up this morning with severe itching and a red arm at the injection site.   Prior to yesterday and todays reaction, I did not experience anything except a sore arm. It is 9:00am, I  am waiting to see how I feel, if it becomes necessary to contact my Dr. ????time will tell.

Waited till Saturday, the 29th to see a doctor., and she diagnosed that I had Shingles. She gave me two medicines to get from my druggist. One was valacyclovir and the other was HYDORcodone. These helped to relieve the pain. I was limited to  5 of the HYDROcodone,  so when I was finished with those tablets, my nighttime pain in my shoulder was very uncomfortable.

                                                From the patient&#39;s chart (regarding the vaccination on 02/03/2021): &#34;The nurse states that when she gave the injection that upon exit of the needle there was some bleeding. This was stopped with a Band-Aid. After the vaccination there was a slight area of erythema that may be more contusion or bruising from the injection. The area is not tender but we will need to keep a watch on this. The patient was told to elevate this and put some ice to this for the next hour or so. Waiting 15 minutes after the injection for evaluation and other side effects was unremarkable.&#34;  The patient later stated that the injection site got somewhat warm on the day of the vaccination after she received the vaccine. She stated that she placed some ice packs on her arm for about 15 minutes on that day and that she and the injection site had no issues or adverse reactions after that. - 02/10/2021  &#34;I tried reporting this today electronically but was unable to submit it because the website would not let me submit it.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine I had racing heartbeat for 2 hours. I was short of breath over the next few days. I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

                                                On Sunday the 2/21/2021, about 3PM I noticed that the area where I received the vaccination  was red, swollen, itching, and sore. I googled search and found it was a rare but real reaction vaccine, called COVID ARM. According to the information I read it occurs between 7-9 days after vaccination. Mine occurred exactly 7 days later. I have been putting Hydrocortisone cream with Aloe in it and on it. Today it is more sore then itching and still red. The Hydrocortisone with Aloe seemed to help.   I have also noticed my eyes have been watering a lot more since receiving the vaccine.

Then I noticed large three large red blotches  from  almost shoulder to  about six inches from elbow.  They became a darker pink and outlined in red.  They were very itchy for several days, but otherwise I felt fine.  As of today I still have the blotches, but they seem to have faded a bit (red outline still visible) and the itchiness is much less.

Woke from sleep about 3:00 AM the next morning itching in  all over both arms (all over), face, and eyes. Took 1/4 of a 25mg Benidryl tab and maybe 30 min later went back to sleep. Symptoms were still present the next day and I did not feel well. Took more Benadryl 25mg tab every 4 hrs and symptoms were gone the next day (Tuesday).  Monday, 2/22/2021, had a virtual appointment with a physician and spoke with her about this reaction.

The red site itched and hurt a bit when touched.  (Note: I took a Benedryl pill and put some Cortozone-10 ointment on the circle the second day after the injection when the circle appeared.) That day and the next the tissue within the red, 3-inch diameter circle got progressively harder - it felt as firm/hard as a golf ball. (I took another Benedryl pill the third day after the injection, but switched to Benedryl ointment, which worked better for the itch than the Cortizon had.)

That evening she started feeling really bad and knew she was having a shingles flair again.  Reports she was nave able to finish her shingles vaccine series because she developed shingles a week after her first vaccination.   She was still within the 6 month period to wait to get the second dose when this occurred.  She called her doctor who advised her it was ok to take her antiviral for the shingles and that she could still get her second injection for the COVID vaccine.

For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

On January 14th she states she woke up to her deltoid red, swollen and itching.  She has been applying cortisone cream for the itching to the site.  Today she has noticed a darker red linear line that is also in the reddened oval on her arm She came in today (01/19/2021) and I observed a large reddened area (approximately 5cm)  to her Right Deltoid.  I also marked the area to see if the redness goes outside of the circle.  Encouraged client to start applying cool compresses to the affected area.

It looked like there were 2 giant hives on my my arm (bigger than a nickel). Took 1 Benedryl (25mg), which didn&#39;t help. Hardly slept due to itching, and soreness to the touch. I can&#39;t wear a blouse with a sleeve. Today (Sunday 1/24), the redness came together into 1 big red blotch, measuring  2&#34;x3.5&#34;. Hot to the touch, and very sensitive. I feel pain into my shoulder blade area and where my arm meets my body in the front. Also, pain going towards my elbow. Ice / cold packs make it feel better. I will call for Dr. appointment tomorrow (Monday morning).

                                                With the second dose I experienced itching and what it feels like a swollen mass on my left arm. I could push it and it would move around my arm. Like a little ball. It was hot to the touch. I also developed cellulitis on my left arm but not at the injection site, lower (medium anterior lateral part of my left arm).  I decided to go to the ER to get it checked and they told me it was cellulitis. They prescribed me Augmentin and it did the trick, 48 hrs after starting the Augmentin it was much better and now it is all gone. The little moveable lump in my arm is much smaller but I can still feel it if I press it.

She had water and cold compress. I sat with her and her caretaker for another 15 minutes or so.  The caretaker left to bring car around and we used wheelchair to help her to car.  She never did pass out, and was feeling a little better.  The caretaker was going to stay with her to keep a watch over her.  Patient called a couple of hours later to let us know she was doing ok and had been lying down.  She wasn&#39;t having the chest tightness anymore and her head felt better, but she had developed a rash across the chest.

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

I outlined the area of irritation with a marking pen and when I inspected it about 24 hours later, the erythema had increased to cover almost all the distance from shoulder to elbow but remained confined largely to the dorsal aspect of my upper arm. No soreness remains but itchiness continues and this is. I have taken liquid diphenhydramine at bedtime for the last three nights and used a topical anti-itch cream occasionally but have avoided any other treatment or medications. Itching and redness continue and expansion of the afflicted area continue 11 days post injection.

We administered the vaccine and approximately 2-3 minutes later she was turning red and calling me for help. I asked her what was going on and she said to help her, that she can&#39;t breathe, and that she thinks she is going to die. We administered a dose of Epinephrine and shortly after she said she was feeling better but she was shaky/jittery. EMS was called simultaneously and they arrived shortly after.

                                                was seated and waiting for her 1:12 appointment. We administered the vaccine and approximately 2-3 minutes later she was turning red and calling me for help. I asked her what was going on and she said to help her, that she can&#39;t breathe, and that she thinks she is going to die. We administered a dose of Epinephrine and shortly after she said she was feeling better but she was shaky/jittery. EMS was called simultaneously and they arrived shortly after.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had no pain or soreness, but the area was a little tender if you pushed, and she waited one hour in the hospital afterwards.  As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again. Consent given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, area was a little tender and had some bruising near eye, were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 84 year old female patient with medical history including atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

After getting up from bed and eating her usual breakfast, she was returning to her bedroom when she became dizzy and fainted, falling to the floor, hitting her head and suffering other effects, including rhabdomyolysis from being on the floor for a long time after the fall as she was unable to get up. She was transported to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days. She was treated with IV fluids, Tylenol and a short course of antibiotics. While hospitalized, she had a repeat of a rash/swelling at injection site that began about 48 hours after vaccination.  The hospital treated the rash with some barrier cream and within 48, the redness, rash and swelling abated.

To contact us if symptoms worsen and to the ER if any worsening symptoms or respiratory compromise.

                                                On Thurs. 02-25-2021,  I woke up noticing that my left arm where the shot was given was itching and a little sore.  I was surprised because the initial soreness had gone away.  Later, when I looked at my arm in the mirror, I saw a rough-looking blochy rash area where the shot had been given  and it extended around the arm and down toward my elbow.

I seen Dr. at Clinic this morning,  she said it looked pretty good and if I wanted to maybe I should delay getting the 2nd dose for another a week. Otherwise I look good and healthy.

There was no redness induration or other findings at the immunization site, all findings were distal to the elbow, and they included a very mild erythematous streak from the antecubital fossa to the wrist as well as mild to moderate edema on the volar aspect of the forearm. The symptoms were improving with Tylenol and application of topical Aspercreme at the patient had started prior to my evaluation on 2/1/2021.I could not explain the relationship to her vaccination, but felt it necessary due to the timing and fact it was in the same extremity as the immunization was given that I should report this

Has tried putting ice on it, as my daughter recommended her to do 2 days ago in 15 minutes intervals 3 times a day. Slowly fading now since been placing ice on it.   Spoke to my doctor yesterday who recommended her to call VAERS and make a report and then call back and make an appointment to get checked out once I spoke with you (VAERS).

                                                After approximately 5 days began developing rash and swelling at injection site, so-called &#34;Covid Arm&#34;.  Swelling, some pain, and significant itching in a patch some 4 to 5 inches in extent.  Gave her some over-the-counter antihistamine (Claritin) and this helped to resolve the symptoms somewhat.  Redness had abated somewhat by the end of the day.  I am reluctant to give her too much of the antihistamine due to dizziness and increased lack of mental clarity (she suffers from Alzheimer&#39;s).  Being a military wife, she has had many vaccinations, but has never had a reaction like this before.

It was itching really bad and there were small bumps and she was red from one shoulder to the other. I applied a itching cream and it only lasted a couple hours so we tried many different creams but nothing seem to stop the itch. The rash is from her shoulders to her neck line and from nick to waist line and it itches tremendously.  The NP stated it was Shingles and she was prescribed meds and took them for 10 days and it cleared up for a few days. today it&#39;s broken out again and its itching. She&#39;s scheduled to get the 2nd dose and don&#39;t know if she should get the next dose

                                                On 2/14 the patient describes the typical symptoms of a sore arm at the injection site. The patient reports an expected decrease in symptoms until 2/22/21, when the injection site became itchy and swollen, and developed a slight rash. I advised the patient to take Tylenol for pain/fever (especially for her second dose on 2/24/21), to take Benadryl at nighttime for the rash, and to use some OTC topical lidocaine for the itching/discomfort as needed.

She is also having significant sleep issues which have also contributed to her cognitive and physical problems.

About 5:00 PM her mouth started watering and she got the drive heaves, and then about 15 minutes and then started having them bad.  She laid down and after 15 minutes she could not breath, couldn&#39;t get any air.  When she was able to get some air, her throat was sore and she was really hoarse.  Later in the evening she laid down again and the breathing difficulty happened again and it was worse.  She was scared to the point that she was afraid to lie down.   She is fatigued.  She finally fell asleep during the night and didn&#39;t sleep much and today is very tired.  She called her doctor this morning, and talked to the nurse.   They told her if it got worse to go to the ER.  Told her to call the CDC.

Other than a minor soreness in the arm, I had no adverse effects. On Friday, January 22nd, however, the area around the injection site became red and warm. At this time, two days later, the inflammation continues and the reddish &#34;patch&#34; is beginning to itch. Just thought that you would want a report of this delayed reaction.&#34; Per conversation with patient, on this date 1/25/21, pt reports that she is still experiencing small amount of itching as well as redness and slight sensitivity to the injection site.  Pt denies need for further medical care, and that she is fine but thought we should know.

                                                Left arm became red, warm, swollen within hours of injection. This continued to spread starting with a 2 inch circle and spreading down the arm to the elbow and encircling the arm.  Warmth, pain, swelling and redness increased. Also had profound weakness and lethargy that lasted three days.  No elevated temperature.    Contacted Dr. on 2/5/21 via email in MYCHART Main line health.  He advised cool compresses, hydrocortizone and Benadryl or Claritin.  We continued this regimen with no improvement  until 2/16/2021. At that time redness was faint on arm about 2 inches of deep red and painful circling arm near elbow.  On 2/18/2021 rash gone but skin peeling from shoulder to midarm.  No further pain or redness or warmth after 2/20/2021

                                                On Friday, February 18th, 2021, patient received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid administered by Pharm D at our pharmacy. The patient called the pharmacy on March 4th, 2021 to explain that her arm was red and itchy.  The pharmacist that day told the patient to use ice compresses and to come by the pharmacy to show us her reaction.   Today, March 5th, the patient came to the pharmacy with her son to show us her left deltoid. I observed her arm was red and hot to the touch. She has very defined edges of the rash on her arm. She did not have streaking on her arm, that I observed.  Patient said she had a small, red spot about 3 days after she received the shot, which started February 21st .  She was complaining of itching and has been watching the red spot get bigger every day. I instructed her to call you to have you look at her arm. She said it was just itching and she would like to try OTC products before going to the doctor.  I instructed her to take Benadryl 25mg up to four times per day.  Because Benadryl will make her tired, she can only take it when she is at home and not driving.  I also gave her Hydrocortisone 1% ointment to use at least twice per day on her arm.  I also reiterated that ice packs would help with the redness and discomfort.  She verbalized her understanding. I instructed her to call you to make an appointment if she is not improving. I also told her if she sees any signs of continued spreading or red streaks on her arm, she needs to seek immediate medical attention.

Itch at vaccination site happened at some point, at the time I ignored it and did not associate it with anything.  Vaccination site was pink. My daughter had drawn a circle with a pen around the pink vaccination site on Wednesday  6 January, to see if the pink area grew.  Yesterday 11 Jan when I went to shower I noticed it was still pink and somewhat itchy, and the pink area had extended beyond the circle about 1 mm.  Today 12 Jan it has not itched, but it is still pink and extends about 3 mm. It is not hot to the touch, it is not tender to the touch. It has finally begun to slowly fade, but it is still ongoing.

On 23 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 001A121A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Feb 2021, the patient experienced the event received the second dose 52 days after the first one . On 24 Feb 2021, the patient experienced the events feels sleepy and arm is sensitive.  No treatment information was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event(s); therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event(s) is not applicable.  On 23 Feb 2021 the outcome of events received the second dose 52 days after the first one was resolved. The outcome of events, feels sleepy and arm is sensitive was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered for mRNA-1273 (lot # 001A121A for the second dose) with associated AEs reported as sleepy and injection site pain 1 day after vaccination. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This was the 2nd Moderna Shot on 2-18-2021.  She received the first shot on 1-22-2021. Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
