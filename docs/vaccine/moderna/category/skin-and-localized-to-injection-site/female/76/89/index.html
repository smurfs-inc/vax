                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

                                                Observations Covid19 vaccine: On 1/8/21 the first of the 2-stage Moderna vaccine was injected at the facility.  The injection was barely felt and the symptoms were mild over the next few days. On January 17th - 9 days later - the area around the injection felt itchy upon waking.  Swelling, redness and heat were observed at the injection site in an area about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Soap and water was applied for the itchiness and Tylenol was taken. The itchiness mostly subsided.  Above the affected area a few scattered raised splotches are present. I had read about this set of reactions to the vaccine but had not read that this might occur as many as 9 days after the initial shot, so I thought I&#39;d share that with my doctor via My Chart and with you in case it was useful. Thanks. This is the first day of the reaction and I expect it to go away on its own over the next few days. It&#39;s not sore just slightly itchy.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine shot, my left upper arm from should down began to itch.  Slight red, under the skin &#39;rash&#39; could barely be seen.  The individual spots did not seem to be the specific irritant.  The arm around the shoulder was somewhat achy and tight feeling.  I was able to sleep through the night after rubbing on Sarno-anti itch lotion.  Could not get comfortable on my left side, with the shoulder area hurting.

The circle was about 2 inches diameter.  Over the next two days, although the swelling abated, the rash expanded down and around my arm. I am now in my third day of having the rash. Now , the rash is about 6 inches down my arm  Like her, I am wondering whether I should have the second dose of the vaccine.

Upon investigating, I had a huge welt 2 1/2 inches in diameter that itched obsessively.  The center of the welt was a white spot that was probably the injection site.  Several peripheral red spots were evident, probably from the intense itching.  I had noticed no issues in the days leading up to the 8th day.  I have only put aloe gel on the site.

                                                On date of vacation 1/14/21, I had no reaction other than a slightly sore left arm which was better the next day and I had no other symptoms until today.  Today 1/22/21, 8 days later, I woke up with my left arm sore at the vaccine site and when I looked, I found a bright red circle about 2&#34; in diameter around the site.  It is not hot to touch or sore - just a little itchy.  Since the vaccination I have used no ointments or lotions on my arm, have done the same exercise each day, and have had no bump or accident to my arm.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Ten days after the injection of Covid 19 injection my arm swelled up, and became very red and itchy at the site of the injection.  It just came up out of nowhere it seems as I had no reaction at all to the vaccine during the prior 10 days since the vaccination. This continued for two days.  The first day after it happened I felt tired and weak in the morning.  I got into work here at the house and the weakness went away.  I treated the itchy situation with Clobetasol Propionate Cream which I had here and was prescribed by my dermatologist for poison ivy.  That took away the itchy situation that was very annoying.  Two days into it the swelling began to go down.  Today is the 4th day since the problem occurred and there is no swelling and only a slight redness.  I am assuming that I can take injection #2 on February 9 as scheduled.

During the next six days the area enlarged in a bell shape extending to about two inches above my elbow and about half the circumference of my upper arm.  It would be more noticeable in the morning upon waking and later in the evening.  I would put a cool wet facecloth on the area.

I spoke to a doctor and he prescribed  Twice daily, of Doxycycline Hyclate. He said it was unusual to develop symptoms at this time so it could be a delayed  reaction or an infection. Airing on the side of caution, he prescribed the antibiotic. My temperature is normal and I have no other symptoms.  I?m also taking Benadryl to relieve itching. I?m on the medication for the next ten days.

                                                Itchy rash at injection site, started one week after 1st Covid inoculation (Jan 24).  Still present as of Jan. 29, 2021.  Lymph node under arm is swollen and sore.  Rash is not infected, only itchy.  Saw doctor Jan 26 who said it was either cellulitis or shingles.  Saw second doctor Jan 27 recognized it as Covid arm.  I wish this had been noted as a side effect on the web.  I could have saved myself both the cost and potential Covid exposure from two different doctors&#39; visits.  Also, it would be nice to know if this is a delayed allergic reaction to vaccine components or a beneficial reaction by the immune system.

                                                Delayed reaction -- EIGHT DAYS AFTER my innoculation, I developed some swelling and itching in my upper left arm around the injection site. The area is oval shaped, about 2 by 3 inches, and the skin is pink. The swelling and itching have abated somewhat in the last 36 hours but not disappeared completely. I have twice applied ice to the area briefly, but have taken nothing else for the swelling and itching. I had no other reaction to the shot except slight soreness only the day after the shot. I find it strange that this swelling &amp; itching arose so much later (8 days).

Patient reported that it was periodically itchy and she has been scratching it. She stated that yesterday (day 9 after vaccination) that she noticed the size of the redness had increased. She said it was still periodically itchy and only slightly tender to the touch. She said she felt otherwise fine no systemic effects reported. Patient had not taken anything. Recommended benadryl and icing the area. Treatment outcome unknown at this time.

                                                The following day after my injection, I had bright RED hives all over my body except for my face and hands.  It was very uncomfortable.  I tried to calm my skin with lotions.  As the days progressed, the color receded and all of my skin started to peel.  It was terrib ly itchy and difficult to wear clothing. It took about a week for it to calm down, and the peeling continued for another week.

Extremely itchy!! Applied cortisone ointment to the area 2-3 times a day for approximately 3 days. Saw personal physician on 2/16/21 to discuss my reaction and to confirm that there was no need for concern and it would be safe to receive my second dose. As of this reporting, my arm has cleared up completely and I am no longer experiencing any itch or pain. At the time of the injection, I experienced pain as the vaccine was being administered and subsequently a very painful arm for approximately a week and a half.

Vitals, EKG, CT scan, and MRI conducted. MRI showed an acute mild stroke on R side of brain.  Over-night stay was recommended. Echocardiogram was performed the following day and nothing was abnormal. I am now on a heart monitor for 30 days. Upon departure of hospital the symptoms in L leg and arm have nearly resolved but face is still numb/decreased sensation. Plan to contact PCP tomorrow.

                                                Approximately 4 days after vaccine a large red area appeared around the injection site.  It was about the size of large lemon.  It was warm but not hot to the touch.  The initial reaction to the vaccine was redness about the size of a silver dollar, warm and tender for about 24 hours and then resolved.  The second occurrence was 4 days after the vaccine. We used ice packs and advil but the next day it was larger and redder and by 48 hours later it was quadrupled in size - roughly 8&#34; x5&#34;.  On  Friday afternoon 01/15/2021, we held a telemed conference with her internist.  She prescribed methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack for a total of 6 days beginning 01/16/2021, she also prescribed 7 days of 3x/day Cephalexin 500 mg, and Triamcinolone .1% cream.  She also recommended hot then cold alternating packs on the affected area and  using Tylenol or Ibuprofen several times a day.   On todays date 01/17/2021 the redness has faded probably 30 - 50% and it&#39;s size has shrunk 20% as well.   I observed my wife getting her vaccine from a nurse (I have no name) and although I could be wrong it was my impression she cotton swabbed with alcohol on  an upper a smallish area on the left arm (size of a quarter), but proceeded to give the injection just above the swabbed area ?..

                                                On Wednesday afternoon she had a fever of 103, was very fatigued.  Got up in the middle of the night and had dry heaves, went back to bed and was okay.  Her arm got really red, hot and blisters all over it like a sunburn.  It is down to about the size of a half dollar today.  The blisters burst and have made places, is still warm and sore and looks like it is drying up.  Did look like a severe sunburn.  She ran a little fever until Thursday night 2/18/21.  The arm is still sore to touch today, 2/22/21.  She took some Tylenol the night her fever was 103, then it went to 101.   The fatigue is diminishing, she has slept a lot, but wonders if her arm is ever going to be right.

Mostly it is just a rash about the size of a golf ball or a bit larger.  It showed up about 8-9 days after injection.  I have been putting cortisone 10 cream on it for the itching and it helps some but not completely.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

                                                I got the shot on Monday 1/11/2021, had a slight fever on the 12th and couldn&#39;t raise my arm higher then my shoulder. On the 13th my arm was fine. Then I didn&#39;t worry about till the 01/18/2021 in the evening and it felt warm and it was a big patch of red (looked like a rash) about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide like a oval shape. On Tuesday 01/19/2021 I called my doctor,  spoke with nurse what was going on. Doctor told her to put cold compresses on the site 15 minutes on and then 15 minutes off and take Tylenol as needed. The area is still warm and the redness area is still there.    Did go to local grocery store and spoke with pharmacist who advised her to contact VAERS.

Less likely true allergy to some component vaccine or injector, but degree of discomfort bit concerning.  We have asked pt to discuss second dose with PCP and vaccine provider.

Ignored it but the redness started to spread on the arm, started feeling firmer, decide to see doctor.  Saw him on 1/22/21, who felt like some of the bacteria got under the skin and put her on Benadryl and Doxycycline.  It&#39;s a lot lighter as far as redness, and not as firm but redness is spreading 4-5&#34; across the arm.

                                                After 5 days of nothing but a slightly sore arm near injection site my right upper arm began to itch.  Nothing too major but odd. On eve of 1/25 I looked at arm and it seemed normal. Next morning, January 26 i looked at arm and red vertical rash and quite itchy. Emailed Dr he said if it became larger or more itchy we might need to treat with steroid cream.  Since I had some hydrocortisone cream i put some on at bedtime and again morning of 1/17.  Took pictures morning of 1/27 also.

The patient reported experiencing arm pain around the injection site during the 2 days following the vaccination. The patient reported experiencing hip pain and trouble with her legs on 1/21/2021. On 1/22/2021 the patient reported not being able to stand without bracing. The patient visited a doctor on 1/25/2021 and there was suspicion for inflammation of the spinal cord leading to the patient being prescribed prednisone for 6 days. The patient visited the doctor again on 2/2/21 and another course of prednisone was initiated. The patient reports that she can stand from a sitting position without help getting up about half the time and that she had no such trouble standing prior to the vaccination. The patient returned to the second vaccination clinic on 2/11/2021, which was  4 weeks after receiving the first dose, to report her symptoms. The patient was not administered the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 04-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown), intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Feb-2021, approximately 48 hours after vaccination, the patient developed allergic reaction and had hives all over her body. The patient received diphenhydramine for hives. The patient also stated that inside of her was burning, face swelled up, lips swelled up and throat swelled up. The patient rushed to emergency room (ER). They needed to take the patient to an allergist because they wanted to find out if this was related to the vaccine. The allergist told her that they couldn&#39;t do an allergy testing. The patient asked if there were any reports on people showing allergic reaction 48 hours later after the vaccine. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, allergic reaction, hives all over her body, face swelled up, lips swelled up, throat was swelled up, and burning, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 05 Jan 2021, the patient woke up real sweaty at 3 am. She got up and went to the bathroom and passed out. The patient reported that she fell on the commode then got to the floor because she felt weak and could not walk. Once she regained her strength, she returned to bed.   On 07 Jan 2021, the patient reported that her arm was still sore at the injection site and continued to feel weak. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The events, passed out, sweaty, and couldn&#39;t walk were considered resolved on 06 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, felt weak and arm still sore at the left arm injection site, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 80-year-old female patient  with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Loss of consciousness, the non-serious listed event of Injection site pain, and the non-serious unlisted events of Asthenia, Hyperhidrosis, and Gait disturbance.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events on the day after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

This then spread down her arm 2-3&#34;.  Did not have pain or soreness.  She went to the ER and the doctor looked at it, and she told her that she did not know if it was a reaction to the vaccine or if the are was not cleaned up right.  She then put her on an antibiotic and told her to see her doctor.  She FU with the PA and he didn&#39;t give her any further instructions.  The area has residual pinkness, warm to touch, warmer than the rest of the arm, but not much.

The area does not really itch, but is just red.  For the first two days, the rash didn&#39;t move.  Then over the next several days, the rash starting spreading down the upper arm. On February 18, the patient experienced bad diarrhea.  On February 21, the patient put a cold damp cloth over the area to soothe the area.  Some areas within the rash are improving, but the redness continues to spread down the arm.  The area felt like a bad sunburn, and the patient put some salve on it one day, but did not notice a difference.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

                                                Received Moderna shot at 2PM on January 12,2021.  On January 21 around 10AM my upper left arm was itching.  upon further investigation of the area I noticed a good size red oval patch on my upper left arm located approximately 1 inch above the site of my Moderna injection site.  It was slightly itchy and was hot to the touch.  I had no fever and felt perfectly fine.  The area was not sore.  I applied an anti-itch cream and placed an inquiry with my personal doctor.  His office sent a response this morning advising me to notify the provider.  There was no information on my COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card of who to notify and I could not get through to them on their phone which is constantly busy with people calling for appointments.  I did see info saying to report adverse reactions on line at vaers.hhs.gov which is what I am doing.  My concern is whether or not I should get the second shot.

On 1/23/21, started to put warm compresses x 3, Sunday the same thing and by Monday it had dissipated and was fine.  Then last night 1/29/21, about 1:30 AM got up as she was not sleeping well, took two Aleve.  Woke up this morning with arm itching, red again and kind of warm.  Feels fine but that location has reappeared from the initial injection.  Pink in color and warm to touch.

The second day she shaking and jerking, couldn&#39;t hold on to anything.  Her blood pressure was up and down that day. She said she felt like she was dying and then she vomiting where she bruised both elbows on the toilet bowl due to the jerking movement she was experiencing.  She took a nap and woke up confused.  She was hallucinating saying she felt like she went from a small box to a blue box to red box and didnt recognize her room.  Her sitter said her eyes were glazed but was able to recognize her sitter at that time.  Blood pressure dropped so the sitter then called EMTs where they checked her out.  Vital signs were good but she declined to be transported to the hospital via ambulance.  The third day she was feeling some better where she was able to eat and get a sponge bath.  Fourth day she was better so was able to shower.  She states she is better now with just a little soreness and redness around the injection site.   Pt has contacted her PCP and spoke with the nurse about her symptoms.

                                                7 days after receiving the shot I developed a rash and itching at the site. It is 13 hours after the rash appeared it is still there and is now around 2 inches by 3 inches.  It itches. I don&#39;t think this is an emergency i am reporting it because I think it is unusual and want to know if I should be concerned. I don&#39;t know whom to ask.  Also, can I still get a second shot at the same site?

                                                I had my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Feb. 10, 2021. I had about three days of chills, aches, headache, very sore arm. etc. On Feb. 22,2021 a red area  about 3 or 4 inches around the site of the injection was noticed. It was itchy and uncomfortable. I spoke to my internist and allergist. There is some disagreement about whether I should take the second dose.  I have taken benadryl and tylenol. Both doctors said it was unusual for such a reaction 2 days after receiving the vaccine. What information do you have about rashes occurring so long after the vaccination? What is the recommendation about the second vaccine? Thank you.

It started about 2-1/2 inches x 3-1/2 inches and has grown to about 3 inches x 4 inches (maybe little more).  It has a darker red rim around it and has become lighter in the center .  It is a little bumpy where it grows and gets more red.  It might itch a little--not much.  I have been putting hydrocortisone cream on it.  My concern is that it is getting larger.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine I had racing heartbeat for 2 hours. I was short of breath over the next few days. I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

                                                On Sunday the 2/21/2021, about 3PM I noticed that the area where I received the vaccination  was red, swollen, itching, and sore. I googled search and found it was a rare but real reaction vaccine, called COVID ARM. According to the information I read it occurs between 7-9 days after vaccination. Mine occurred exactly 7 days later. I have been putting Hydrocortisone cream with Aloe in it and on it. Today it is more sore then itching and still red. The Hydrocortisone with Aloe seemed to help.   I have also noticed my eyes have been watering a lot more since receiving the vaccine.

                                                About five days after receiving first COVID shot I felt itchiness in left arm. Then I noticed large three large red blotches  from  almost shoulder to  about six inches from elbow.  They became a darker pink and outlined in red.  They were very itchy for several days, but otherwise I felt fine.  As of today I still have the blotches, but they seem to have faded a bit (red outline still visible) and the itchiness is much less.

That evening she started feeling really bad and knew she was having a shingles flair again.  Reports she was nave able to finish her shingles vaccine series because she developed shingles a week after her first vaccination.   She was still within the 6 month period to wait to get the second dose when this occurred.  She called her doctor who advised her it was ok to take her antiviral for the shingles and that she could still get her second injection for the COVID vaccine.

                                                The injection did sting, but didn&#39;t think anything about it. For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

Like a little ball. It was hot to the touch. I also developed cellulitis on my left arm but not at the injection site, lower (medium anterior lateral part of my left arm).  I decided to go to the ER to get it checked and they told me it was cellulitis. They prescribed me Augmentin and it did the trick, 48 hrs after starting the Augmentin it was much better and now it is all gone. The little moveable lump in my arm is much smaller but I can still feel it if I press it.

She had water and cold compress. I sat with her and her caretaker for another 15 minutes or so.  The caretaker left to bring car around and we used wheelchair to help her to car.  She never did pass out, and was feeling a little better.  The caretaker was going to stay with her to keep a watch over her.  Patient called a couple of hours later to let us know she was doing ok and had been lying down.  She wasn&#39;t having the chest tightness anymore and her head felt better, but she had developed a rash across the chest.

                                                Moderate soreness/redness and slight itching noticed at injection site within 24 hours after receiving injection but I did not do a visual inspection until several days later when these symptoms became irritating and troublesome. I outlined the area of irritation with a marking pen and when I inspected it about 24 hours later, the erythema had increased to cover almost all the distance from shoulder to elbow but remained confined largely to the dorsal aspect of my upper arm. No soreness remains but itchiness continues and this is. I have taken liquid diphenhydramine at bedtime for the last three nights and used a topical anti-itch cream occasionally but have avoided any other treatment or medications. Itching and redness continue and expansion of the afflicted area continue 11 days post injection.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had no pain or soreness, but the area was a little tender if you pushed, and she waited one hour in the hospital afterwards.  As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again. Consent given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, area was a little tender and had some bruising near eye, were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 84 year old female patient with medical history including atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

                                                The morning after vaccination, she felt extremely  and unusually fatigued. After getting up from bed and eating her usual breakfast, she was returning to her bedroom when she became dizzy and fainted, falling to the floor, hitting her head and suffering other effects, including rhabdomyolysis from being on the floor for a long time after the fall as she was unable to get up. She was transported to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days. She was treated with IV fluids, Tylenol and a short course of antibiotics.

                                                Noticed a red rash on her left arm the day after vaccine. Did not look again until 8 days later and noticed the reddened area  got bigger. Has tried putting ice on it, as my daughter recommended her to do 2 days ago in 15 minutes intervals 3 times a day. Slowly fading now since been placing ice on it.   Spoke to my doctor yesterday who recommended her to call VAERS and make a report and then call back and make an appointment to get checked out once I spoke with you (VAERS).

It was itching really bad and there were small bumps and she was red from one shoulder to the other. I applied a itching cream and it only lasted a couple hours so we tried many different creams but nothing seem to stop the itch. The rash is from her shoulders to her neck line and from nick to waist line and it itches tremendously.  The NP stated it was Shingles and she was prescribed meds and took them for 10 days and it cleared up for a few days. today it&#39;s broken out again and its itching. She&#39;s scheduled to get the 2nd dose and don&#39;t know if she should get the next dose

The patient reports an expected decrease in symptoms until 2/22/21, when the injection site became itchy and swollen, and developed a slight rash. I advised the patient to take Tylenol for pain/fever (especially for her second dose on 2/24/21), to take Benadryl at nighttime for the rash, and to use some OTC topical lidocaine for the itching/discomfort as needed.

We took her to an urgent care clinic on 3/2/2021 and they diagnosed her with a shingles outbreak more than likely as a result of her vaccination.  She did not have any reaction to her first Moderna vaccination four weeks earlier.  She was prescribed an anti-viral.  She is more comfortable now but her cognitive and physical abilities have declined significantly.  She is also having significant sleep issues which have also contributed to her cognitive and physical problems.

Other than a minor soreness in the arm, I had no adverse effects. On Friday, January 22nd, however, the area around the injection site became red and warm. At this time, two days later, the inflammation continues and the reddish &#34;patch&#34; is beginning to itch. Just thought that you would want a report of this delayed reaction.&#34; Per conversation with patient, on this date 1/25/21, pt reports that she is still experiencing small amount of itching as well as redness and slight sensitivity to the injection site.  Pt denies need for further medical care, and that she is fine but thought we should know.

Itch at vaccination site happened at some point, at the time I ignored it and did not associate it with anything.  Vaccination site was pink. My daughter had drawn a circle with a pen around the pink vaccination site on Wednesday  6 January, to see if the pink area grew.  Yesterday 11 Jan when I went to shower I noticed it was still pink and somewhat itchy, and the pink area had extended beyond the circle about 1 mm.  Today 12 Jan it has not itched, but it is still pink and extends about 3 mm. It is not hot to the touch, it is not tender to the touch. It has finally begun to slowly fade, but it is still ongoing.

                                                This was the 2nd Moderna Shot on 2-18-2021.  She received the first shot on 1-22-2021. Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
