                                                Arm under injection site turned red and itched a lot. Doctor gave  me cephalexin 500mg for 7 days. I am also taking benedril. Redness is better and itching is much better.

                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

                                                Observations Covid19 vaccine: On 1/8/21 the first of the 2-stage Moderna vaccine was injected at the facility.  The injection was barely felt and the symptoms were mild over the next few days. On January 17th - 9 days later - the area around the injection felt itchy upon waking.  Swelling, redness and heat were observed at the injection site in an area about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Soap and water was applied for the itchiness and Tylenol was taken. The itchiness mostly subsided.  Above the affected area a few scattered raised splotches are present. I had read about this set of reactions to the vaccine but had not read that this might occur as many as 9 days after the initial shot, so I thought I&#39;d share that with my doctor via My Chart and with you in case it was useful. Thanks. This is the first day of the reaction and I expect it to go away on its own over the next few days. It&#39;s not sore just slightly itchy.

Slight red, under the skin &#39;rash&#39; could barely be seen.  The individual spots did not seem to be the specific irritant.  The arm around the shoulder was somewhat achy and tight feeling.  I was able to sleep through the night after rubbing on Sarno-anti itch lotion.  Could not get comfortable on my left side, with the shoulder area hurting.

I scratched it and later looked in mirror.  Site was red  3 1/2&#34; X 4 1/2&#34;   It is now day 11 after shot and has spread 1/2 - 1  inch, but seems lighter.  Have taken picture every day to document.  I feel great otherwise and arm does not itch or bother me.  Just red.  Just wanted to make sure I can take next shot and thought I should report.

                                                On date of vacation 1/14/21, I had no reaction other than a slightly sore left arm which was better the next day and I had no other symptoms until today.  Today 1/22/21, 8 days later, I woke up with my left arm sore at the vaccine site and when I looked, I found a bright red circle about 2&#34; in diameter around the site.  It is not hot to touch or sore - just a little itchy.  Since the vaccination I have used no ointments or lotions on my arm, have done the same exercise each day, and have had no bump or accident to my arm.

                                                Eight days after the Covid Moderna injection, I had intense itching at the injection site.  Upon investigating, I had a huge welt 2 1/2 inches in diameter that itched obsessively.  The center of the welt was a white spot that was probably the injection site.  Several peripheral red spots were evident, probably from the intense itching.  I had noticed no issues in the days leading up to the 8th day.  I have only put aloe gel on the site.  Ready to report to my Primary.

                                                Delayed rash on arm at injection site. On the 8th day following vaccination, I developed a circular red rash, slight swelling, hot, vaguely itchy.  The circle was about 2 inches diameter.  Over the next two days, although the swelling abated, the rash expanded down and around my arm. I am now in my third day of having the rash. Now , the rash is about 6 inches down my arm  Like her, I am wondering whether I should have the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Eight days after the Covid injection, I had intense itching at the injection site.  Upon investigating, I had a huge welt 2 1/2 inches in diameter that itched obsessively.  The center of the welt was a white spot that was probably the injection site.  Several peripheral red spots were evident, probably from the intense itching.  I had noticed no issues in the days leading up to the 8th day.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Ten days after the injection of Covid 19 injection my arm swelled up, and became very red and itchy at the site of the injection.  It just came up out of nowhere it seems as I had no reaction at all to the vaccine during the prior 10 days since the vaccination. This continued for two days.  The first day after it happened I felt tired and weak in the morning.  I got into work here at the house and the weakness went away.  I treated the itchy situation with Clobetasol Propionate Cream which I had here and was prescribed by my dermatologist for poison ivy.  That took away the itchy situation that was very annoying.  Two days into it the swelling began to go down.  Today is the 4th day since the problem occurred and there is no swelling and only a slight redness.  I am assuming that I can take injection #2 on February 9 as scheduled.

Then, the evening of Day 6 (Jan. 20) I felt a little itchy around the injection site.  Morning of Day 7 (Jan. 21) I was very itchy and my upper right arm was very itchy, red and inflamed.   I called my dermatologist, and she told me to use a prescription cream I had from an irritation  on my thumb last year, called Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.1%.   I also called my primary doctor,  to let her know what was happening.  Day 8 (Jan. 22) my upper arm was still very inflamed and seemed to be spreading wider across my arm, maybe 4&#34;x3&#34;.  Day 9 (Jan. 23) a little better. Day 10 (Jan. 24) much better. Almost gone. Little bit of red left. Still using cream until it goes away..

It has stayed sore since then, Yesterday it was bothering me so I looked and noticed there was knot about the size bigger the a dime but smaller then a quarter.  Slightly red area the injection site and has been itching. Feels warm to touch. I haven&#39;t really bad or anything. Since Saturday I have been trouble with my stomach which isn&#39;t anything unusual. It seems like it is upset.

                                                Arm was swollen and had pain for two days then went away.  Then 10 days later the injection site itched and burned and became swollen again with redness.  The itching has subsided on day 12 after vaccination but still has redness and some  pain and swelling.  I called my primary physician and they prescribed 2 Advil.  They said to call back if it does not improve in 2 days.  I think it is weird that it has become red and sore again after the initial pain 2 days after injection had subsided.

Immediately noticed a small dimed sized firm nodule formed under skin. Patient denied pain and no other symptoms. Observed in the monitoring area for 30 minutes and the nodule started to decrease in size.

                                                Itchy rash at injection site, started one week after 1st Covid inoculation (Jan 24).  Still present as of Jan. 29, 2021.  Lymph node under arm is swollen and sore.  Rash is not infected, only itchy.  Saw doctor Jan 26 who said it was either cellulitis or shingles.  Saw second doctor Jan 27 recognized it as Covid arm.  I wish this had been noted as a side effect on the web.  I could have saved myself both the cost and potential Covid exposure from two different doctors&#39; visits.  Also, it would be nice to know if this is a delayed allergic reaction to vaccine components or a beneficial reaction by the immune system.

I spoke to a doctor and he prescribed  Twice daily, of Doxycycline Hyclate. He said it was unusual to develop symptoms at this time so it could be a delayed  reaction or an infection. Airing on the side of caution, he prescribed the antibiotic. My temperature is normal and I have no other symptoms.  I?m also taking Benadryl to relieve itching. I?m on the medication for the next ten days.

During the next six days the area enlarged in a bell shape extending to about two inches above my elbow and about half the circumference of my upper arm.  It would be more noticeable in the morning upon waking and later in the evening.  I would put a cool wet facecloth on the area.

                                                After shot my arm was a little sore, but by the following afternoon (Jan 28)it really hurt. When I actually looked at it,the area around the site was very, hot, swollen. That evening I took two Advil and used ice. The next day it was still quite uncomfortable and iced the area and had Advil again.  The 30th was still swollen and red.and itchy/stingy. Used ice and Advil. Today it is not as red but still some swelling and a little itchy and minimal discomfort.

                                                On Day 10  after the injection, I developed a red itchy hot rash on the left arm..  It continued to get larger and redder  until it cover most of the outside upper arm.  It did not start to go away until  Day 16.  By Day 18 it was only slightly visible.  On Day 10,  I started taking benedryl  because i thought it might be an allergic reaction.  By Day 11 I consulted with my doctor because it was so large and fire red.  I was given prednisone  and told to use cool compresses.

It appeared suddenly on 1/31 and has subsided slightly now.  I had surgery at Hospital today to remove a port and the medical personnel advised me to report this rash.  I attempted to do so,   but was advised by Urgent Care to go to the Emergency Room, which seemed totally unnecessary. I have an appointment for the second shot on 2/22 and wanted to get advice before that.

                                                The day after the injection I was sore and the arm was bruised, purplish color, and hot to the touch. And this morning I got very itchy around the vaccine site and its still red and hard to the touch, like there was a lump under the skin.  The bruise has faded a little but its not getting much better. Medical provider called to recommend benadryl and tylenol, and keep a warm pack on it, and also to seek help if it has not improved over the weekend.

About 5 days after the soreness went  away I developed a rash on my arm. My arm was hot and swollen.  I went to an urgent care the same day I noticed the rash, they put me on steroid and antibiotic Cephalexin. They also sent me to the ER for an ultrasound to make sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  It is normal now. Besides the rash I felt fine otherwise.

Was unable to eat anything  until late afternoon on Sat. the 6th.  Had a bad headache throughout and bad soreness at the injection site.  Still have headache (approx. 5pm on Mon. 2/8) but soreness at injection site has almost disappeared.  I do not have a primary physician so have not called anyone. Am now taking Advil for headache which helps but it returns if I stop.

                                                Initially, my left arm had a red spot for 10-11 days. Then clear. 14 days later I went swimming in a lane I had reserved at my club. Lanes are reserved for 45 minute swims. This was my second swim after my first Covid vaccine. About 15 minutes into this second swim, the outside of my throat began stinging and itching. Soon my chest was stinging and itching. A friend was swimming in the adjoining lane. I told her I was going to cut short my swim because of stinging. She reported that my throat and chest were very red. About 6 minutes later I was home, took an  OTC anti-inflammatory (Zyrtec), took a shower. I believe it was vaccine belated because I also had a large, thin ring around the injection site. Over the course of the next hour the stinging, itching, redness subsided. I told my Dr. She told the allergy dept. They suggested I take a Zyrtec prior to my next swim, which I did. No reaction. I did NOT have a similar reaction the first time I swam after the injection. It was exactly 2 weeks later that I had the rash and stinging.

I contacted my physician who diagnosed covid arm. I treated it with benadryl. The same event happened the next day, but less intensely, also treated with benadryl. The third day there was a smaller reaction and I treated with allegra.  This had nothing to do with the injection site. The site was sore to the touch for about a week.  I am wondering what will happen with the second dose.

A little itchy, a little sore, about 3&#34; in diameter.  Did some internet searching and saw it might be &#34;Covid Arm&#34;, no reason to worry, and no reason not to get second shot which I&#39;m scheduled for on the 18th.  Might use the right arm though since it&#39;s still a little warm and sore.

                                                Four days after the injection, my left arm displayed a red area about an inch in diameter.  It also itched.  Today is the 8th day since the injection and my arm is now all red from the shoulder halfway down to my elbow.  The area is warm to the touch and is raised and really itches.  The red area is now 4 1/2&#34; wide and 5 &#34; long.  I have no other symptoms and feel fine.  Just thought you would want to know.

About 12n my daughter took the temp of my arm and it was 102 so we made ice packs to help with the pain and swelling.  Later she went an bought Cortisone and used the ice packs and Cortisone for about 3 or 4 days when the arm finally begin to get better.  My arm was so painful it was almost unbareable to touch.

Over the following week, area of redness increased in size, moving up and down my arm and reaching about 6-7 inches in diameter.   Dr. initially prescribed Benadryl, and then changed to Zyrtec.  I had taken a Benadryl prior to vaccine since I had a similar reaction to the flu shot, although not as much redness.  As of this date (2/22/21) symptoms are lessening although some redness remains.

                                                I woke up with severe Number 10 pain in my right knee, front , back and side. It was red, tender and swollen. The pain moved down to my right ankle and foot with severe muscle spasms pulling my right foot inwards toward my left foot. I could not walk to bathroom without screeming. Then it moved to my right hip area with muscle spasms across my lower back.  I am still experiencing pain and muscle spasms (not as severe) today at this writing. It seems to be attacking my body where I have old injuries.

This continued for a full week or more. The point of the injection was clearly visible with a whitish area around it.

                                                A few days after the injection, the site of the shot started to itch. Then it became slightly swollen and red, and felt warm to the touch. It continued at this level for another 2 days or so, then it started to recede. I took Advil to reduce symptoms. It took about 5 days after the onset of these symptoms for it to clear up. I am reporting this only for research purposes. I&#39;m fine.

I did not have any side effect when the injection given, other than a bit of soreness at site. Will follow. Read about others having this issue when I checked the websites. Will go ahead and have the scheduled second injection in a couple weeks. Suppose just a good sign my immune system is working? But thought any reactions should be shared with CDC or Maderna as part of their ongoing research.

On the next day she developed a fever of 101-102 along with  fatigue, nausea, weakness, so she slept all day.  Third day her fever was 99.8, she still had fatigue and arm was hot to the touch at the injection site.  She now has a rash an inch below the injection site and is about 3x4 inches in size.  Pt has not contacted her PCP at this time.

Noticed that now her arm w as itchy and had a small round circle. Notice that the red circle was getting bigger and felt hot.

                                                2 weeks and 2 days after injection of first dose of covid vaccine I noticed a rash and itching on left side of torso.  Included achy pain and sharp, stabbing pin-prick pain. It spread to my back. Went to Urgent Care 4 days later and it was diagnosed as shingles by Dr.  He prescribed 7 days of valacyclovir and Advil and Tylenol for pain. Was told it will take weeks to clear up. I had the Shingrex vaccine (both doses) 18 months ago and am not supposed to be able to get shingles. I had chemotherapy for lymphoma 6 years ago and I believe it adversely affected my immune system. I&#39;m reporting this in hopes you could ask people if they&#39;ve had chemotherapy in the past, which may lead to adverse side effects such as shingles. I also had severe nausea 36 hours after the covid first dose, which I have previously reported. The sore arm was to be expected and I ignored it.

I advised to take IBU or acetaminophen, ice, and rest to help with symptom management. Advised that if symptoms worsen to come in to be seen at the clinic.

After using anti-itch ointments, (Cortaid &amp; Cortizone-10), the itching has continued and has spread farther down the arm that was innoculated/vaccinated this week. I tried calling my health clinic, but they have been closed because of the winter storm. I have called the Pharmacy to speak to the pharmacist, but was placed on hold for about 15 minutes, without a pick-up of my call. I would just like some advice as to how best to address my issue because the itching still persists.

I tried to calm my skin with lotions.  As the days progressed, the color receded and all of my skin started to peel.  It was terrib ly itchy and difficult to wear clothing. It took about a week for it to calm down, and the peeling continued for another week.

                                                Delayed reaction -- EIGHT DAYS AFTER my innoculation, I developed some swelling and itching in my upper left arm around the injection site. The area is oval shaped, about 2 by 3 inches, and the skin is pink. The swelling and itching have abated somewhat in the last 36 hours but not disappeared completely. I have twice applied ice to the area briefly, but have taken nothing else for the swelling and itching. I had no other reaction to the shot except slight soreness only the day after the shot. I find it strange that this swelling &amp; itching arose so much later (8 days).

                                                Patient said the day of the vaccination she developed a red patch about 1/2 inch in diameter that was red and swollen and a little tender. Patient reported that it was periodically itchy and she has been scratching it. She stated that yesterday (day 9 after vaccination) that she noticed the size of the redness had increased.

Extremely itchy!! Applied cortisone ointment to the area 2-3 times a day for approximately 3 days. Saw personal physician on 2/16/21 to discuss my reaction and to confirm that there was no need for concern and it would be safe to receive my second dose. As of this reporting, my arm has cleared up completely and I am no longer experiencing any itch or pain. At the time of the injection, I experienced pain as the vaccine was being administered and subsequently a very painful arm for approximately a week and a half.

                                                I woke up Friday 2/12 morning very dizzy. The dizziness subsided. Later Friday afternoon, I had severe dizziness and was vomiting when I got up. I went to Clinic Saturday 2/13, for being unbalanced and weak, but not so dizzy. Sunday 2/14 I was extremely weak with low blood pressure and fast heart rate.  Monday  2/15, in the morning,  my left arm started hurting, swelling, was feverish, red, itchy and I had a rash at the injection site. I went to my doctor on 2/19 and he stated that maybe I should not get the 2nd vaccine shot. He stated that he was not certain that everything that happened was a result of the vaccine, but that he couldn&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t.

                                                On February 14, I had used the handlebar rotation exercise of a stationery bike for 5 minutes.  The next day I noticed a large swelling about the size of half a pear on the muscle where my Moderna injection was done.  It was as hard as a nut, red, and warm and itchy with a red rash around it.  I saw an urgent care medical person and was told it was probably a reaction to the exercise and that sometimes that happens after an injection.  I was told to use cold compresses, hydrocortison cream, and rest it.  I did this, for 5 days, but  though the swelling subsided, the rash continued to move around and down my arm.  I went back to urgent care on February 19 and was told that it looked better.  I was offered prednazone for it, but declined since I was still on Budesonide .  I was told it would probably clear up over the weekend.  On February 22  it hadn&#39;t cleared up so I saw  a PC.  She  noted the rash  had spread, but swelling had gone down.  She checked my lymph node under my left arm and noticed it was swollen.  She said it was most likely due to a mild infection in the arm where I had  received the vaccination.  She  prescribed  a Zpack and after 2 days, all symptoms were gone and I felt so much better.  This event happened 10 days after my vaccination.

                                                The same night after receiving the vaccine, my arm starting swelling, itching. The next morning I woke up and the rash was there, and spread over the different areas of body. I was sweating bad, muscle pain, joint pain, and nauseated for about 3 days. I had knots in my arms. I went to the doctor last week, and she gave me a shot in the hip, it helped with the swelling.  Then I called her back and she called in a cream for me.  The other symptom remaining is the rash at the injection site, I have been putting the cream on it twice a day, taking Benadryl and Tylenol for pain

It persists without improvement today. I also had pain in the joints in my feet and ankles, hands. Some fatigue. No fever, no chills. I had NO reaction after 1st vaccination, although injection site was hot and very tender for days. Used left arm both times. I saw an online photo of &#34;COVID arm&#34; hypersensitivity reaction and looks exactly like mine. Really quite uncomfortable.

Elevated BP could be related to the fact that she was vomiting so much, she had hard time taking her scheduled medications, included BP medications.   This lasted for 3 days. Patient was taking Ondasentron and that was only reliving nausea for 2 to 3 hours. She was taking Tylenol to bring her fever down. 650 mg Tylenol was only lowering temp to about 37.8.  For about 72 hours she was complaining of extreme generalized pain and weakness and had very hard time getting up to go the bathroom.  She started to fill a little better on March 27, 2021.

Body aches lasted for about 12 hours.  48 HOURS AFTER INJECTION:  The area below the injection site, on the outside of the right arm, was red and slightly swollen.  It was hot, and ached.  The ache was stronger under pressure.   I have never reacted to an injection like that before.  MY IDIOT WORRY:  Did the entire dose of vaccine pool below the injection site and thus got nowhere to the rest of my body to do any good?    However, the same thing happened to a friend of the same age.

                                                From Dr.  notes from the patient&#39;s visit to the office on 02/08/2021:   &#34;*ACUTE CELLULITIS OF THE RIGHT UPPER ARM--I do believe that this is a result of the injection and not due to the vaccine itself. The fact that he continues to have some slight growth does necessitate that we treat this with an antibiotic. I am what have you TAKE TMP-SMX DS 1 tablet twice per day for 7 days. Elevate this arm and keep moist heat to this area and it should improve quickly. Call me if there is any worsening. I will CHECK COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT TODAY to evaluate this more fully.&#34;  Also from Dr. notes from the patient&#39;s visit to the office on 02/08/2021:   &#34;This fine lady comes in today stating that she received the CoVid 19 Moderna vaccine with the first dose on 2/2/21. The patient previously had a moderately severe case of CoVid 19 in late September and early October. She states that the vaccine did cause her to have severe chills for 2 days and then she started to develop an area of erythema near the injection site and this continued to progress. She called me on Friday in regards to this and then on Saturday it had continued to grow. We did have her husband demarcate the borders of the erythema and today it seems like she has had another further growth of an inch or so in most directions. The patient has a little tingling in this area but really has no significant pains and she denies any fevers since she had fever on Thursday night and Friday with a temperature of 102.&#34;

She said she has no chills this morning. She states that her arm where she received the 2nd dose of COVID-19 (left deltoid) is pink, warm to the touch (can feel warmth through clothes), and tender to the touch. She said her husband will use a marker to mark the borders of the area of concern on that arm to see if the borders change with time. I notified Dr. of this information. I notified her that Dr. recommends she place heat on that area of her arm and to call us if any further symptoms develop. She also said she will notify us if she develops a fever 03/04/2021.

                                                In the evening lots of pain in left arm. during night chills including teeth chattering, pain all over, no sleep but slept through most of the next day, ate nothing.  Was quite concerning but did not call doctor although I sure thought about it. I was wondering if I was actually infected with Covid- 19. Shot was Tuesday 2: 30 PM, felt a bit better by Thursday but arm still hurt even on Friday arm was red and swollen down to my elbow. Saturday fine. I thought someone should know about this as lost of my friends also had difficult reactions. But this was the first time I saw an opportunity to respond.

                                                On the 9th day (Fri., 2/19) after my shot I developed a very intense rash all over my stomach, and on the underside of my breasts. It was very itchy.  I considered the possibility that it was the seafood soup I had eaten, but all day I also  had very bad pains in my lower back, left hip, and left knee. I had knee surgery in August, but this pain was much worse than I&#39;d had in months. The pain and rash continued thru the next day Sat., 2/20.  Then on Sunday the pain was completely gone, and the rash started to subside. Then the following weekend  (2/27 and 2/28) the rash had a mild flare-up, and there&#39;s mild itching off and on since them.

Fatigue lasted approximately 1 week; other side effects about 3 days.  2 days after injection, had a 3 by 6 inch red raised itchy welt appear about 2 inches from injection site.  Gradually faded over a one week period.  I had an allergy injection 2 weeks prior to Covid vaccine.  Contacted allergy doctor and we agreed to postpone next allergy injection until after second Moderna vaccine, in case there was a connection.

These occurred in late afternoon on 3/5/2021 - a day after 2nd Moderna vaccine injection.  I also developed a low fever for part of the same afternoon (3/5) into early eve. I also had some ache in center chest (gone now) which I never had before (angina?).   It is now 3/6/2021 and I still have swollen underarm glands (right arm), right arm soreness at injection site, and some itching there as well. But no fever just now.  I&#39;m VERY CONCERNED the swollen glands will not go away in time for my aortic valve replacement surgery on 3/15/2021.

I slept for approximately 3 1/2 hrs.  Upon awakening  I still had chills but no fever 98.8 and all my joints ached.  6 pm I took 2 Ibuprofen and by 7:30pm I had warmed up but was extremely tired.   10 pm I took 2 more Ibuprofen and went to bed.  I slept until 7 am and feel wonderful.  My arm is a little tender yet but no trouble using it.

                                                On March 9, I noticed some discomfort in my left arm.  Upon examination, I observed swelling in my left arm around the injection site. There was also redness around the site measuring 4 1/2? long and 3 1/2? wide. It was warm to the touch. I applied ice to the area and took a Benadryl capsule.   The ice brought down the swelling and the redness did lighten some.  Today I still feel some discomfort in the shoulder, the swelling is gone, and the redness, although lighter, has increased in size to 5 1/2? long.

                                                It started out as itching, next morning  I had a big red blotch on my left elbow which lasted 2 days then the next day another one came up under my left arm,  then has continued on other parts of my body. I still have a big red plkace where I got the shot and a little white place in the center. I have been taking Benadryl which probably has help me from getting more. My doctor told me to take that. Then I have days that I getting itching spells over my body.

                                                Eight days after injection, my arm had a hard red rash about the size of a 4 x 4  inches. Itched bad. I put Benadryl spray on the place as well as Benadrly by mouth. Next day the rash went all the way to the elbow and was swollen. Today at 11 days it is still red but doesn&#39;t itch as much. It seems to be getting better.

Thereafter, through the night,  a  feeling of fever, back &amp; forth: skin hot, then normal feeling.  Some chills.  Took my temperature several times and would only get a normal reading.  Puzzled, because  I thought I must have a fever.....the STRANGENESS  of this  was that my skin felt like it was BURNING UNDERNEATH my skin....not like any fever I might have ever had. Still normal temp readings.   The next day...mostly in bed, tired, no appetite, continued fever feeling, but no fever temp reading.  The second day, up and around, eating.

                                                I experienced itchiness on my right arm during the first week after my second shot but did not look to see if there was the large red area that is pictured online. However, on the eighth day, I reached over to touché my arm and felt many bumps. I looked in the mirror at my right arm and saw a rash consisting of many large, red bumps. They did not hurt, they were not itchy.  They have been very slow to resolve.  Now, after eight days, the bumps while still visible are finally beginning to fade. I have daily photographs of my rash if you?d like to see them.

The second occurrence was 4 days after the vaccine. We used ice packs and advil but the next day it was larger and redder and by 48 hours later it was quadrupled in size - roughly 8&#34; x5&#34;.  On  Friday afternoon 01/15/2021, we held a telemed conference with her internist.  She prescribed methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack for a total of 6 days beginning 01/16/2021, she also prescribed 7 days of 3x/day Cephalexin 500 mg, and Triamcinolone .1% cream.  She also recommended hot then cold alternating packs on the affected area and  using Tylenol or Ibuprofen several times a day.   On todays date 01/17/2021 the redness has faded probably 30 - 50% and it&#39;s size has shrunk 20% as well.   I observed my wife getting her vaccine from a nurse (I have no name) and although I could be wrong it was my impression she cotton swabbed with alcohol on  an upper a smallish area on the left arm (size of a quarter), but proceeded to give the injection just above the swabbed area ?..

Primary care doctor checked it on 1-23-2021 and thought it was inflammatory response to injection .No treatment advised  except to re-check in a few days.. It is slowly going away but not completely gone as of 1/28/21 and was rechecked by doctor today.

                                                After i had my injection about 7 hours later about 4-5 o&#39;clock I was sitting in a chair and I got up and my balance was completely off and I almost fell into glass table. I felt very foggy and my head wasn&#39;t right. I had to hold on to things and I sat down and I kept saying I just didn&#39;t feel right.  I called my daughter and my arm was hurting and I figure that&#39;s what happens, I was getting so tired and really bad headaches. My daughter asked somebody and they told me to take extra strength Tylenol (500 mg ) 2 at a time 6 hour intervals. Which i did i got up the next morning and i had to go back to bed i had no energy. I felt horrible. When i did get up in the afternoon all of a sudden i had horrible chills and that day in Florida it was 82 degrees and i put the heat on 84 and i was extremely shaky and cold. I went back to bed and later i did have a fever, not highs, it only went to 100.8 but during the evening it did break because my sheets were almost saturated. Yesterday morning 1/27 Wednesday i felt better, fever had gone down, pain was still there in my arm and swelling. I thought that was natural. In the afternoon i decided to take a shower and i noticed my left arm around the injection site was a red rash about 7inches long and 4-5 inches wide which  i had to seen before i called my primary doctor just to make sure this was normal around injection site and talked to the nurse and she thought it was normal. But if there was no changes to call her back on Friday. Last night not able to sleep i saw an article that said COVID arm rash seen after Moderna vaccine, annoying but harmless it was a large article and it made me feel better but there were only 14 examples but they believe there were more because they were younger people with the health dept. that received this vaccine. It said in 1week it should go away.  I still have it, its still red and sometimes itchy and i am happy to say now that i know it will be a week i feel better. it should be on the list of side effects for all.

                                                I received my injection on 1/25/2021 I had my second COVID shot, everything went well, I just had a little pain and swelling and was fine. About 7 hours later i got up from chair and i was dizzy and my balance was off and i almost fell into table. I didn&#39;t feel right. I went and sat back down and i was very tired and i started getting headache. I called my daughter and a nurse she knows told me to take extra strength Tylenol 500 mg take 2 every 6 hours. I started at 730 and went until 130. I slept on and off and got up Tuesday and my arm was still hurting. I was very tired and had no energy. When i got up later in the afternoon i had extreme chills. It was 83 degrees in Florida nd i turned heat up to 84 and i was still shaking. I got under covers and had a fever it was 100.8. Went to sleep that night and fever broke. Got up Wednesday and felt a little better, still had headache and tired. Decided to take a shower. I noticed my left arm where the injection was was all red. 6-7 inches long and about 5 inches wide which i never saw before. after shower I called my PCP I contacted the nurse said she thought it was normal and if there was no  change to call her back on Friday. my arm is still red and warm i went to sleep but couldn&#39;t sleep. I saw an article about COVID arm rash seen after Modern vaccine and now i know that&#39;s what I had. I feel better after I read it in the magazine today and it said it will only last a week. This should be listed as a side effect so nobody else wonders what it is. I drank so much water because it said to drink plenty of water and i tried to use arm as much as possible.

                                                On day 10 arm started turning very red and painful. Redness continues spreading up and down arm until up above shoulder and almost to elbow.  To ER on Sunday.  Said use Tylenol and cold packs.  By next Friday almost all redness gone but upper arm and shoulder are now very painful.  No issues with arm until day 10

The next morning the swelling got worse and she also noted similar swelling around her Left Hallux Longus (similar to a pseudogout reaction). No intraoral swelling. Speaking clearly in full sentences.  She has never had similar reactions such as this nor has a h/o pseudogout or polyarthritis.

Since it has not totally gone away, I said &#34;No&#34; to Item 20.

It is now Jan 30, 2021 and the area is still itching, tho less, and is still hot.  There is a 1/4&#34; wide reddish ring in a circle of about a 3&#34; diameter around the shot site.  Today I put a cold compress on it and was surprised that as soon as I took it off after about 10 minutes it was still hot.  I am worried about having the 2nd shot in the same place.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.  2:00 am 1/28/2021- woke up feeling queasy, joints in legs were achy. My left  knee replacement felt like it was in a vise,  This  was a  short lived event with some residual feeling in the knee in the morning.   3 days after injection  10:00 pm 1/30/2021- I noticed a small rash on my left abdomen near the navel, this rash moved quickly to the left and soon covered entire left abdomen, moving to the groin area then down left inner thigh.  I took a Benazepril and went to bed. During the night I woke up several time with a strong pressure in left bowel area. Changing position seemed to help and went back to sleep. woke up about 5 am and checked the rash which was mostly gone except for the original spot where it began.  The rash and pressure seemed to be restricted to front left side below waist area. It is now 11:00 am 1/31/2021 and I am feeling fine, very little residual rash at initial site.   I had not read anything about delayed reactions as late as 3 1/2 days after the injection so wanted to report this event.

Went to urgent care doctor and was told there was an infection from the shot or a reaction from the shot. Doctor gave my an injection of Rocephin 1g IM. I was prescribed 500MG of Keflex PO 3 times per day. Symtoms got worce and went back to primary care doctor. Doctor stated that I should continue with the same treatment and return for further tests if  the condition did not get better.

                                                Eight days after first Moderna injection, I developed a rash over a large area of my upper left arm starting just below the injection site.  It is red, warm, and burns/itches.  Now, on the second day of the rash, it is somewhat larger, and still burning/itching.  I saw my health provider the second day, and was told to treat it with ice, antihistamine, and Tylenol.  She said it is consistent with a delayed allergic response seen 5-9 days after Moderna injection.  I can&#39;t comment on my outcome, as this is only the second day.

The next couple of days it remained very itchy, started light pink and got pinker never got really red color. On Sunday 31st in the morning it looked normal but later in the day it got pink again. Yesterday and today it is fine besides it is itchy. I have not been scratching it.  One day I put some Benadryl cream on it one time.

Eight days after the shot, however,  my right arm started to itch  in the morning, and by nighttime, the shot site was no longer itchy but swollen, red, and hot.  I applied ice treatment which helped relieve the heat and swelling.  Today, my arm is much better.  I still have a slight swelling with a  light redness around the shot site, but no discomfort, no heat.  I reported this delayed reaction to the shot to my doctor?s office, and they referred me to you to report my experience since they thought it was an unusual reaction.

It continued to be very itchy and when I looked at it it was red, with hives, and an additional red spot as well as red spot where needle had gone in.  It has continued to be very itchy, and area between the two red spots has appeared bruised (perhaps from scratching).  I have only rubbed it through clothing.  I put on some camomile, and it was a little less itchy for a while.  3 days later, it&#39;s still itchy and red area continues.

On Jan 28, 2021 I noticed stiffness and pain in both of my knees. My Right knee was replaced in 2015 and my Left knee was replaced Oct 5, 2020.  I thought it was strange to have pain in the Right knee. The stiffness has increased in both knees since Jan 28. I otherwise feel fine but am having difficulty bending both knees and I have pain when I am weight bearing. I am wondering if the vaccine is attracted to artificial joints? I am scheduled to get my second dose on Feb 17.  Please advise if this is a common reaction.

                                                patient arm was red, swollen, and warm to the touch. Injection site was hard to the touch. Symptoms started the evening of shot and continued the next few days. As of today, (2-9-21), she still had symptoms as stated above but stated she was improving. She also stated that she was going to the Dr. today for an unrelated issue and would get them to look at her arm.

                                                I observed an inflamed itchy area just below the injection site on Day 9. The inflammation broadened and spread downward over the next two days, reaching about 7 inches in length and 3 inches in width by Day 11. I consulted a dermatologist then. She recommended a double strength dose of Zyrtec and application of Triamcinolone ointment to the inflamed area.  Over the next two days, this therapy halted the spread and reduced the inflammation, so that it was essentially gone by Day 13.

Then about 8 days later, just over a week she woke up and her arm was red again and more swollen and looked like a black and blue area where the needle went in.  There was a red rash around that point.  The rash was larger than the palm of her hand.  She was tired that day and it did go away after 2-3 days.  She took Tylenol one night due to the pain to help sleep.  She did not call her doctor.  It has now totally resolved as of today, 2/10/21.

                                                I took the first shot of Moderna?s COVID-19 vaccine  the middle of January. Two and a half weeks later, I developed a two inch rash above my right breast even though it didn?t itch or burn, if pressed, it hurt. I treated it with antibiotic ointment and calamine lotion. During that time, I experienced tiredness, exhaustion, sluggishness as well as aches around the right shoulder. I went to get a mammogram where they told me my lymph nodes were swollen on the right side under my arm. They had seen adults who had taken the shot develop swollen lymp nodes  which made it necessary to retake the mammogram. I also went to the dermatologist to see what the inch rash was, he took a biopsy, and it turned out it was shingles even though I had had the shingles shots a year before.

                                                After about 7 days she looked at it and it was a quarter or larger area that was red, raised, inflamed area.  Around it had some little smaller redness, not raised that were blotchy all over.  It was a little itchy and when she touched it it was a little warm.  It was not a real bad reaction, but did not feel sick just the redness.  The next day it itched more and took a Benadryl, and about 2 days later it started to fade, but did merge together and got lighter and lighter in color and is almost completely gone.  it is not itching anymore and is light pink.

She experienced injection site pain, itching along her upper arm, fatigue, a low-grade fever, and facial flushing that lasted about 4 days with only mild relief from OTC ibuprofen. Recommended OTC acetaminophen to the patient and to report to her PCP for follow-up.

A hardness to the spot was later noticed.  Over the next five days, the redness seemed to fade but the area expanded to approximately 3&#34;x4&#34;.  Today, 9 days before my second Moderna shot, the pink mark is almost invisible.  There was never any pain, just itching.

                                                On Wednesday afternoon she had a fever of 103, was very fatigued.  Got up in the middle of the night and had dry heaves, went back to bed and was okay.  Her arm got really red, hot and blisters all over it like a sunburn.  It is down to about the size of a half dollar today.  The blisters burst and have made places, is still warm and sore and looks like it is drying up.  Did look like a severe sunburn.  She ran a little fever until Thursday night 2/18/21.  The arm is still sore to touch today, 2/22/21.  She took some Tylenol the night her fever was 103, then it went to 101.   The fatigue is diminishing, she has slept a lot, but wonders if her arm is ever going to be right.

                                                Moderna COVID19 Vaccine EUA I received the first injection on Feb. 13, 11:00. Because I am very thin, I wasn&#39;t too worried when my arm was sore for a couple of days, but on the 6th day, I was awakened at night with an intense itch at the injection site, and in the morning I saw an egg-shaped and egg-sized bright red area and it was swollen. I contacted my doctor on line, and she recommended hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl, which I have been doing for three days. The red patch has calmed down to light pink, but it&#39;s still sore and a bit swollen. It&#39;s been two weeks since the injection and I&#39;m scheduled for the second injection on March 13. I&#39;m concerned that the reaction will be worse next time.

It has been a week since my injection.  I have not contacted my Dr. but will if it is still there on Monday.

From slightly painful first 2 days to just a little itchy by 5 day- today.  Painful arm a few hours after injection, which mostly ebbed, with the redness starting about 7-8 days after injection, becoming somewhat tender, with that ebbing by 5 day.  On third day ( 8 days after vaccine) Urgent care diagnosed it as a seondary infection and prescribed doxycycline.   Dr. said had never seen anything like it.  Took the antibiotic for 2 days and stopped.  Med seemed to make no difference.

I have not yet had contact with my doctor, but plan to call him and/or ophthalmologist tomorrow, Monday.

Then a couple of hours later she got a severe case of the chills.  She laid down and slept on and off for about 5 hours.  When she got up she took her temperature and it was 101.  She also had body aches in her back and her legs felt very heavy.  She then noticed a rash on her body from a line that went underneath her breast, and redness on the left side of her breast to her belly button, all red around the belly button.   When she realized she had a fever she took Tylenol.  The rash by Saturday was fading and she also had diarrhea on Saturday, persistent diarrhea.  She felt almost normal except that she was tired.  Today, 3/1/21 she has the returned diarrhea, doesn&#39;t k now if it was related to the vaccine.  She spoke to a nurse yesterday, and she told that she had a typical side effect from the vaccine.  She was not sure if the diarrhea was from the vaccine.

On February 20th, eight (8) days after first (1st) dose injection on February 12, an inflamed, itchy rash measuring about four (4) inches in diameter appeared around the injection site, on left arm.  It is now seventeen (17) days since the injection and although the  rash is much smaller, measuring about 1.5-2.0 inches in diameter,  it is still itching on and off.  I am due for the second (2nd) Covid dose in 11 days.  I do not know what to expect with the 2nd dose.

I HAD EMBOLISMS IN BOTH LUNGS, FLUID ON THE LUNGS, AND WAS ON OXYGEN FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS, DAILY INITIALLY AND OCCASIONALLY AFTER 4 MONTHS. Treatment: I could not reach my physician despite repeated attempts. My pulmonologist had previously prescribed a protocol of prednisone and a z-pack should those symptoms recur. Day 6 after vaccine I began the protocol. Day 10 saw improvement in breathing and coughing. Day 14 symptoms resolved. Day 14 (Feb. 16) to Present (March 3) no unusual symptoms. Some nasal congestion and mild occasional wheezing, consistent with pollen season and my usual COPD symptoms. Thank you.

                                                7 days after my shot I work up with a very sore arm and it was itchy. I saw a large oval reddish flat rash, approximately 3 by 4 inches at site where I got my Covid shot. It remained sore and itchy for about two days. The rash went from red to pink and took 13 days before it went away, actually I can still see the outline of it as I go into my 14 th day. I treated the early symptoms with ice and an antihistamine cream for the first three days.

                                                On 3/1/21 at 11:00 AM I received my second dose of the vaccine Moderna. I was fine all throughout the rest of the day. Upon awakening early on the morning of the second, I had moderate aching in all joints, headache, weakness and fatigue. I stayed quiet for day. Upon getting ready to shower on the morning of the 3rd I found I was covered with an angry bright red rash from my neck down to my knees both front and back. Because I did not shower on the 2nd of March I have no idea when it began. On Thursday my head still felt pressure but felt a little stronger and that evening I again showered and the rash looked less angry and bright. Waking this morning on Friday the 5th the rash is gone and I am feeling much better except for soreness in the armpit of the right arm that received the injection.

                                                I had no reaction to the first shot , except sore arm for one day.  After the 2nd shot, the next day I developed a high fever (103) and chills.  I called urgent care that evening to see how to bring the fever down.  They told me that was my body building antibodies.  The fever &#34;broke&#34; later that night.  I never have gotten rid of the chills.  I did not see a doctor for this reaction. During this time, not exactly sure of the dates, the cardiologist started me on a new medicine - Verapamil.   I thought the chills might be from the medicine.  She reduced the dosage due to low heart rate, and I&#39;m still taking the medicine.   I now have a rash on my side and on my left thigh, which is blotchy, red, and itchy.  I do not know if these reactions are from the medicine or from the vaccine, but I suspect it is the Moderna vaccine.  The chills are mostly centered in my legs.  They are not letting up.  I have not seen my doctor about the rash yet.  I have had the rash for a couple of weeks, trying to get rid of it myself.

                                                The upper arm of my injection site started to itch, and develop a pink rash.  The first two days it enlarged to about 4&#34;x4&#34; and was very itchy.  It is now more like 8&#34;x8&#34;,  splotchy with the outer pink splotches itchy, but less itchiness in the more clear central area which had been itchy earlier.  I&#39;m currently in day 4.  Effects are a minor annoyance, but I thought you would want to have info to help gauge the frequency of this particular side effect. I was personally relieved to learn that others had encountered this side effect about a week after the injection, with previously no reaction to the vaccine.  I surprised me when it happened almost a week after my shot.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

I have had Rotator Cuff repair twice on Rt. Shoulder and the pain I feel there is like it is in my rotator cuff. I cannot lift my arm up above my waist without feeling the pain. When I do not use my arm, there is not pain. I do not have a rash any longer but feel there must be swelling in the shoulder. Ocassionally I have some itching in injection area but try not to scratch at all.

Began like a small insect bite, then became increasingly concentrated on knees for 2 days, then spread less concentrated to thighs and shins mostly on front of leg, mostly on left leg. Minor itch, alleviated with anti itch lotions (corizon, oat meal, others). Duration currently 10 days and ongoing  with lessening redness.

These areas persisted relatively unchanged for four days and began to fade by day five (today), although still unpleasantly sensitive to touch. I experienced the predicted fever, chills, body aches and headache, but had no cough, wheezing or difficulty breathing.  The fever, chills, body aches and headache have completely resolved.

Then upon getting up about 6:00 am, my arm was swollen and warm and I had a red rash at the shot site. It get more and more painful to touch but then after three days the swelling started to go down but i also notice that my neck glands and under my arm were also feeling discomfort. I thought it was almost gone except for the glands in my neck but then, last night, March 16th I realized I still had or that a new rash was again on the same area and is still a bit swollen and sore but not as bad as on the 10th. I am really worried about taking the 2nd shot I have a daughter who is having a heart transplant and deaf and she needs me to be in the hosp. with her to interpret for her.

I debated calling 911, but had sick animals I couldn&#39;t leave. Went to bed and when I woke, I could swallow again. However I had severe hives as well as debilitation itching and swelling of my fingers, hands and later, my toes and feet as well. These symptoms have continued in varying degrees ever since I received my first Moderna vaccination.

Then  four days after the fatigue, I was hit with dizziness, and still experiencing both but not to the degree I was at first.   Also have a red, scaly rash on the backs of both hands. Been rubbing Neutragena  gel on them which has helped.

On Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Patient received Prolia injection 2 weeks after 2nd dose of Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccination. Patient side effects reported since Prolia injection are itch all over body, extremely high blood pressure, feels terrible, can&#39;t eat anything but ice chips, and entire body filled with heat during high blood pressure episodes. Patient has been hospitalized twice over the past 2 weeks. Treatment for the events included steroids and amlodipine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcomes of the events were considered not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The events are probably related to the Prolia injection received by the patient, which is known to cause these side effects.

For information my husband received the second dose of Moderna approximately one month after me and he was diagnosed with shingles the same week that I was.  He had also received Shingrix.  I am improved but not completely recovered.

Then I didn&#39;t worry about till the 01/18/2021 in the evening and it felt warm and it was a big patch of red (looked like a rash) about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide like a oval shape. On Tuesday 01/19/2021 I called my doctor,  spoke with nurse what was going on. Doctor told her to put cold compresses on the site 15 minutes on and then 15 minutes off and take Tylenol as needed. The area is still warm and the redness area is still there.    Did go to local grocery store and spoke with pharmacist who advised her to contact VAERS.

We recommended Zyrtec daily, Benadryl 25-50 mg po q 4-6 h prn but cautioned sedation.  Also provided RX clobetasol cream for use BID.  Pt advised any worsening sx, including SOB, itch or swelling airways should prompt immediate ER visit. Likely a brisk localized immune response/injection site reaction.  Less likely true allergy to some component vaccine or injector, but degree of discomfort bit concerning.  We have asked pt to discuss second dose with PCP and vaccine provider.

I took Benadryl, Claritin and Pepcid ( these were meds previously recommended for my daughters allergies). It took about 30 mins after the meds to be able to swallow comfortably without coughing. The rash however lasted three weeks. I has a telemedicine consult with my allergist who was hesitant to advise the second shot.

                                                In my 11th day after taking the Moderna Covit vaccine, a red, warm and puffy spot 2&#34; x 3&#34; appeared in the left arm near where the vaccination shot was given. Checked with Pharmacist who explained possible one of the reactions to the vaccine.  Recommended observation and report to doctor is spot stays longer than 24 hours or get larger with additional symptoms.

Ignored it but the redness started to spread on the arm, started feeling firmer, decide to see doctor.  Saw him on 1/22/21, who felt like some of the bacteria got under the skin and put her on Benadryl and Doxycycline.  It&#39;s a lot lighter as far as redness, and not as firm but redness is spreading 4-5&#34; across the arm.

Now 9 days later the rash is now 3 1/2&#34; x 3&#34;, still hot to touch.  Local doctor said to take benadryl and use warm compresses.  This has not helped and the site is getting larger.

                                                After 5 days of nothing but a slightly sore arm near injection site my right upper arm began to itch.  Nothing too major but odd. On eve of 1/25 I looked at arm and it seemed normal. Next morning, January 26 i looked at arm and red vertical rash and quite itchy. Emailed Dr he said if it became larger or more itchy we might need to treat with steroid cream.  Since I had some hydrocortisone cream i put some on at bedtime and again morning of 1/17.  Took pictures morning of 1/27 also.

                                                One week after my injection on 1/15/21, on the evening of Friday 1/22, my left arm felt warm, was reddened, somewhat swollen and itchy. It has continued for the past 5 days, with the itching and reddening decreasing a little bit each day.  I was surprised that this reaction occurred a full week after vaccination. Should I still take the 2nd dose?

At approximately 7 days post injection she began to have another localized reaction that included reddness, swelling, pain, heat, and a dry skin tecture that progressed to cover the lateral aspect of upper left arm from shoulder to elbow. At time of examination by RN, the patient reports that size and intensity have been increasing for about 7 days.  Patient finds relief in hot shower.  No other treatments attempted at time of exam. Patient reported area may be improving, but she is unsure.   Area was outlined with marker by RN and patient was advised to see PCP for treatment if area increased in size and was not continuing to improve.  Counseled on using OTC benadryl cream if there was itching.

Approximately 3 days later, she noted a bump that was sore to touch and slightly itchy.  It slowly got better.  She did apply clobetasol ointment on January 24 and 25.  It seemed better.  On January 28 the evening and 8 noticed some redness.  She saw me, her doctor, on January 29.  She had a 7 x 7 cm round pink area that was slightly warm and minimally tender.  This was at the site of injection.  It was slightly swollen. I did not give her the vaccine.  She got it through the health Department.

                                                After administration of the Covid-19 vaccine I had 2-3 days of chills, muscle aches, fatigue, sore arm.  Symptoms gradually went away.  Then about the  7th day I started experiencing an itchy arm and a 6 inch circle of intense red at the injection site, with a wide band of white surrounding it, that itched unbelievably, was hot and swollen.  That lasted for several days, then began to subside and now is only slightly red, itches some and is no longer swollen or hot.   My question is:  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose, after experiencing this kind of reaction?

                                                After eight days, my arm began itching at the site of the injection and when I checked on it, I saw that there was a rash.  The rash was a number of small raised red spots and it was slightly swollen around the injection site.  I called the Covid-19 medical line and spoke with a doctor there who asked me if there was a weal, which there isn&#39;t at this point.  He suggested that I keep an eye on it and see if it turns into a weal and get in touch with you and fill report an adverse event.

The red circle is large.  I have a picture to send you.  Fever of 102 the first night, no fever now.  Not sure if it&#39;s infection or from the vaccine itself but today is the 4th  at 4:45 pm and she got the vaccine on the 1st at 1:30 pm.  I have  yet to taken her to the doctors for the increased swelling because I caused the covid vaccine number and a vaccine specialist said this could be normal and to watch it.  I have a picture it looks BIG!

Awakened at about 10:30 p.m. (12 hrs after injection) with extreme pain at/around injection site. Very extreme pain. Had me yelling ow!ow!ow! Pain seemed to become generalized across shoulders and to right arm. Most acute phase lasted about 30 minutes. Fatigue and pain gone by next morning. All seemed normal. But every night since (including last night, 2/6/21), in the middle of the night, I have again been awakened by serious (but not nearly as extreme) pain at/around the injection site. Always gone by morning, although slight ache remains.

                                                On Thursday - four days after the shot, I felt an itch that did not stop.  I kept wanting to scratch it.  There was also a BIG bruise.  I had checked the box on the form that I take Xarelto.  The area was also warm to the touch.  But Sunday, now, the area is quite HARD, still warm and itchy.I am getting worried about it but did not want to go to urgent care if I did not need to .I am hoping to get advice from the agency.

(7:07pm) I asked the tech to grab the epi pen and call 911. Within 30 seconds of first event, patient was almost not breathing. (7:08pm) I placed the patient on her back and delivered the contents of one epi pen into her left upper thigh. (7:09pm) Patient started to regain her breathing. (7:10pm) Patient  was breathing better and able to talk. (about 7:13) 911 arrived, accessed the patient, eventually taking the patient to the hospital. Patient was fully aware and breathing at that time.

                                                The patient was administered the Moderna  Covid-19 vaccine on 1/14/2021. The patient reported experiencing arm pain around the injection site during the 2 days following the vaccination. The patient reported experiencing hip pain and trouble with her legs on 1/21/2021. On 1/22/2021 the patient reported not being able to stand without bracing. The patient visited a doctor on 1/25/2021 and there was suspicion for inflammation of the spinal cord leading to the patient being prescribed prednisone for 6 days. The patient visited the doctor again on 2/2/21 and another course of prednisone was initiated. The patient reports that she can stand from a sitting position without help getting up about half the time and that she had no such trouble standing prior to the vaccination. The patient returned to the second vaccination clinic on 2/11/2021, which was  4 weeks after receiving the first dose, to report her symptoms. The patient was not administered the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

At 10:00 pm I started to get extremely cold and could not get warm. At 10:45 my upper body started shaking very, very bad. I couldn&#39;t control the shaking and my teeth were chattering.  I had to lay down and put my arms under my body to keep them from shaking and I was so cold even though I was wearing warm things and under a comforter.  The shaking lasted an hour and a half. I took my temperature  during the night and it was 102. I am very week this morning, temp. is 99.9.  I was expecting the temperature and pain in the injection site but I can&#39;t find out anywhere on line whether the uncontrollable shaking was normal for the second shot.  .

Her doctor told her it looked like covid arm after having the Moderna vaccine. She was advised by the health department health officer to wait an extra week and get her second shot 5 weeks later instead of 4 weeks later. She was using cortisone cream and zyrtec at home and was advised by her family doctor to continue this. She was also informed by the doctor that the bullseye looked lower than it should on the arm based on where the muscle it in the arm.

                                                8 days after I received the first shot, I developed a large red spot in the area of the shot. It itched so much and anything I put on it to stop the itch didn&#39;t help.  I have taken 3 single pill doses of Benedryl which has eased the itch but it has not gone away as yet. (2/17) I have not taken Benedryl yet today but will have to, I think.

Symptoms continue today, but pt. advises that area is getting better other than the itching.

I think the injection was administrated to high in my arm.  The within the next 24-48 hours I had a headache and was tired. About the 4th-5th day I had tingling, prickly feeling across right shoulder, down both arms down to my fingers and down  my legs down to my toes. This lasted about 5-10 minutes. Then on the 16th it happened again but this time it was my whole body the torso area and my limbs. I also had weakness, I felt like I needed to hold onto to someone to be able to stand. I had an unstable feeling while standing. The headache has occurred on and off since time of vaccination  about 4-5 times.  I  went doctor on Tuesday 2/16/2021, I did not see my doctor this time I see a different  it was a lady doctor.  She wasn&#39;t aware of this being one of the side effects and just to monitor myself and return if the symptoms worsen. She thought it was safe to get the 2nd dose. I have a virtual visit scheduled with Dr. on 2/23/2023

The 4th day I remember thinking I felt dizzy again, and the next thing I knew I was on the floor and hit my head really hard. I think I must have passed out for a nano second. (The first time in my life!) On the 8th day, Feb. 14th, I got a rash on the injection site. It was red, swollen, hot and shaped like a square about 2 inches diameter. I haven&#39;t had an event since.

Later in the afternoon, my right arm where I had the vaccine was very painful, reducing the ability to raise my arm, which continued through the following day.  On Day 3, it was still a bit sore, but improving. On Day 4, I was totally fine.

                                                Evening of 1/28 I started feeling fatigue, muscle aching, stomach upset and headache which lasted till next day around noon.  Then was fine for 7 days.  On 2/5/2021, I went to get my B12 shot and asked the doctor to check left arm where Moderna shot was given as it was itching and a bit sore at the same time.  He told me I was having reaction.  By evening, a third of my arm around injected area was swollen an had red rash.  Then same symptoms of fatigue, etc. came back and I was in and out of bed for the next three days....then at end had a bout of diarrhea.

It crawled. NOTE;  I HAVE GOTTEN THIS SAME RASH OVER THE LAST 15  YEARS.  THE RASH COULD BE FROM AN OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUG AT ONE TIME AND NOT HAPPEN AGAIN THE NEXT TIME THE DRUG IS TAKEN.  THAT IS TRUE FOR ANTI-BIOTICS; I.E. RASH AT ONE TIME, BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE NEXT.  I HAVE BEEN EXAMINED BY AN ALLERGIST FOR THIS AND SHE FOUND NOTHING THAT SHE COULD DIAGNOSE (AFTER COMPLETING SKIN TESTS OF MEDICATIONS)

Top of foot and all along the outside side of it both on top and at bottom of foot all very painful. Ankle and leg very swollen and painful. Can&#39;t walk on foot.  As of 2/26/2021  swelling is not as bad and not so discolored but still some swelling and redness burning and very painful and still cannot use the foot.  Also have noticed places where  I have had surgery or injuries is hurting and being stiff. Am questioning whether or not I should get the 2nd shot. Concerned it will make situation even worse.

                                                36 Hours following the vaccine shot, I noticed a number of dark spots under my arms and on my back. A trip to the Dermatologist on Monday 2/15/2021 determined that the vaccine had caused most if not all of the Seborrheic Keratoses (SK&#39;s) skin growths on my body to change color to a blue color. Four or the SK&#39;s were removed and sent to the lab for biopsy. The result came back as irritated SK&#39;s but no mention was made of the discoloration. After one week Friday (2/19), the blue color began to fade and by Sunday (2/20) the smaller of the SK&#39;s had returned to their original color while the larger still retain some of the blue color. During this time I felt fine.

I have felt chills and sweats, lethargic, achy, today sore throat.  Below site of shot had large bright pink 3inch circle very hot for first few days.  I&#39;m hoping the temperature stabilizes soon.  It took 8 days to stabilize after first shot.  My second shot&#39;s effects are the same as the first short.  By the way, I suffered through Covid for 3-4 weeks from last midMarch through early April and I do still have antibodies and presume that is why I had the reaction to the first shot but I wasn&#39;t expecting the same for the second.  I had also read in a magazine that people with antibodies didn&#39;t need the 2nd shot, however, my Dr. recommended that I get it. Treatment: I took Tylenol for the fever and aches.  I was finally better after first shot in 8 days.  I am not completely recovered yet from the second but I am confident I will have recovered completely in  a few days.

                                                After the second shot, I expected mild side effects and experienced some: mild headache, sore left arm around injection site, fatigue, brain fog. I was walking to my garage with a small package of papers when suddenly my lower back spasmed sharply. The pain was intense. I thought it would subside so I managed, with difficulty, to make it into my car. When I was seated in the car, the spasms subsided. I considered not driving to my two errands but decided that I felt well enough seated in the car to drive and deliver the papers to my tax preparer  and the carful of donations to Goodwill. At the tax office, I called an assistant to come to the parking lot to pick up the papers, which she did. At Goodwill, one of the attendants emptied my car. When I got home at about 10:50, I had to call my husband to help me into the house. I spent the next several hours in agony (11 on a scale of 1-10) with spasms, punctuated by absolutly not moving. The spasms were so bad I could not breathe. My doc prescribed a muscle relaxer, then the next day prednisone, which has helped. Today I will have an mri to determine if the spasms herniated a disc.

As of today the left leg is clear and the right leg still looks red according to the husband. Recommended to follow up with PCP.

                                                Developed a large oval red spot around the injection&#39;s site approximately 9 days after the injection was administered and it lasted approximately a week but still have some rough skin now about 1 month after the injection. Temperature was sometimes higher (98.2) than my normal (97.7) - General muscle aches thru the whole body. The areas was slightly swollen, warm, a bit rough and hard around the vaccination puncture. It was very itchy and reminded me of when I have gotten insect bites (mosquitos, fleas, wasps, bees.) I get higher than usual reactions to these types of bites. I put some ice on it and used a hydrocortisone cream and it seemed to help.

                                                I have a rather large welt on my right arm surrounding the vaccination site - about 3 inches by 8 inches or so.  It looks like a hive.  I only noticed it when it began to itch.  The site is a bit sore and still itches four days after onset.  I have been taking Tylenol for it which seems to help.  Is this really a &#34;rare&#34; reaction so long after receiving the vaccination?  Just curious.

                                                On Saturday 02/20  twenty four hours after receiving   the injection I felt fatigued with loss of appetite and some chills. At the same time I noticed a 2inch  red ring around the injection site. The next day I felt fine ,but had a very sore arm with the red circle and a large pink blush running down to my elbow which never disappeared. The following week the red circle disappeared but the pink blush remained. On Sunday, 02/28 I noted that the blush disappeared but I now had a 3inch red circle around the injection site. On Monday 03/1, the red circle grew and spread, and by 03/2 it was no longer in circular form but spread down my arm to 3inches by 6inches. It remains the same 0n 0/3. It is not painful or itchy. I am worried. I know this is called covid arm but my reaction does seem extreme. I do have some photos beginning on 02/28

The next day I had shortness of breath &amp; I fainted the next thing I seen when I woke up was the paramedics taking me in to the ambulance to do an EKG. Everything was good except my blood pressure dropped. I was not taken to the hospital.

                                                Arm very sore for 2 days. Third day a rash on both arms. Very itchy so I took Benadryl and it subsided. On the third day the chills started around 2:00 in the afternoon. Went to bed with pajamas ,socks ,and a robe in order to keep warm because of the chills. Woke up this morning and the chills were gone and I feel great.

                                                I had a pink smear in the shape of 2 connected ovals that extended down below the injection site to my elbow.  It was pink like Pepto Bismol pink.  It was like a pink suntan = not a rough rash.  It didn&#39;t hurt. I had it for about 5 days getting lighter until it is gone now. I didn&#39;t think it could be part of the vaccine because it appeared about 10 days after the shot but I couldn&#39;t figure out how I got it.  Since it didn&#39;t hurt and no one could see it since I wear long sleeves, I just made sure it didn&#39;t get worse and didn&#39;t pursue it with medical treatment or advice.  It wasn&#39;t until I saw reporting on it that I realize it was a reaction to the shot.

                                                About 9 days after my 1st dose of Moderna vaccine, I began to have itching on my right upper arm in the area of the injection.  That continues today.  Two days after I noticed the itching, the upper arm was hot to the touch, red, and swollen.  The area is about 6&#34; in diameter.  I did not have an elevated temperature, but I felt slightly nauseous and light-headed on March 5.    I had no reaction to the shot until a week and a half to two weeks after the injection.   I still have a red, itchy area on my right arm.  It seems to be slowly improving.

                                                48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I had a hive reaction (redness, slight swelling) over a roughly 7?x5? section of both of my upper arms. This is a typical allergic reaction  I have to ibuprofen, Benadryl and occasionally to something I?ve eaten (source unknown). This is a stronger reaction than I usually have. 24 hours after the shot, I had headache, muscle ache, chills, and fatigue. Those symptoms had pretty much abated about 36 hours after the shot. I did not notice the hive reaction earlier than 48 hours after the shot.

She initially thought she may have pulled a muscle.  Mom is very active for her age.  On Saturday (1/23) pain became unbearable and we went to her home.  My wife looked at the areas where pain was occurring and saw rash that looked like shingles. Mom was taken to urgent care and shingles was confirmed and Gabapentin was prescribed.  Numerous pain medication and other medications later the pain has not eased.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 04-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown), intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Feb-2021, approximately 48 hours after vaccination, the patient developed allergic reaction and had hives all over her body. The patient received diphenhydramine for hives. The patient also stated that inside of her was burning, face swelled up, lips swelled up and throat swelled up. The patient rushed to emergency room (ER). They needed to take the patient to an allergist because they wanted to find out if this was related to the vaccine. The allergist told her that they couldn&#39;t do an allergy testing. The patient asked if there were any reports on people showing allergic reaction 48 hours later after the vaccine. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, allergic reaction, hives all over her body, face swelled up, lips swelled up, throat was swelled up, and burning, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Cellulitis; Red circle and it covered the fleshy part of her arm; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 78-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed red circle and it covered the fleshy part of her arm/vaccination site erythema and cellulitis.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 17 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided) intramuscularly in right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 31 Jan 2021, approximately four days after receiving the vaccine, the patient developed a red circle and it covered the fleshy part of her arm. She was put on antibiotics for cellulitis and after a couple of days it went away, but she finished the seven days of antibiotics.  On 14 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided) intramuscularly in right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was continued.   The outcome of the events, vaccination site erythema and cellulitis were considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She had eaten a protein bar at 11:00 AM on then at 1:00 PM had the above symptoms.  She continued to drink water and kept it down, took her temp about 2 hours later and it was 100.4.  About 4 hours later she continued drinking water, and her temp had dropped to 99._.  She was so weak that she could hardly get off the bed to go to the bathroom and urinated on herself trying to get up out of the bed.  After her fever went down she was able to get up.  Her husband was almost total care and she was not able to take care of him.  She went to sleep and woke up at 3:00 AM and felt so much better, and ate some crackers and took some Tylenol for the headache and felt like she was OK.  She did not eat anything on Friday and on Saturday ate lightly.   The vaccine area is warm to touch, sore and swollen but not much.

                                                Per patient&#39;s son, the patient developed a rash at the site of vaccination 4 days after the vaccine. She also began developing swollen, cracked lips and swollen hands and feet with a blistering rash. The symptoms were reported to our pharmacy by the patients son 28 days after her vaccine, on 3/15/21. The patient was due for her second dose on that day, and he wondered if she should still get it. We instructed him to call her Dr. After seeing her Dr for an appointment today, the patient was told not to get the second dose of the Moderna vaccine.

Went to the Dr. and am going to have a doppler study done ASAP. This may or may not be related to the vaccine. I had an injury on March 3rd to my knee but had no bruising on the knee, just a lump.  this bruising began on approx the 8th or 9th of March, 12 days after the second shot. The bruising is dark and blackish and warm.

The reason for this is unclear. After the injection a rust colored liquid came out immediately according to the patient. She feels that she may not have received all of the first dose of the vaccine. She later reported brusing and pain. The pain is still present to this day. She has received the second shot and did not experience any problems.

                                                I had very tender injection site, with stiff ness in the injection shoulder. The next day I had a steroid injection in both knees , the day after the steroid,  my injection site and shoulder were fine. Also I had the hot flashes and flushes. Possibly from steroid, or the vaccine, is the steroid masking the reaction to the vaccine? Will the steroid negate the effects of the vaccine on my immune system?

I took Tylenol and put on my arm-wrist wrap wrapping overnight, it started to get warm and red the next two day.  I called my primary physician  on Monday 1/18/21 and have a victual visit for 15minutes at 3PM. It is getting better as of now on 1/19/21.

Round area about 3 inches in diameter. I have tried different things to control the itch, took a baking soda bath, what works the best has been wetting a bar of soap and rubbing it on the area until it leaves a white paste on the area and then leaving it to dry.   Has left a message for doctor and has not received a call back.

It is very warm to the touch and itchy. All my initial side effects went away by about the 5th day and this has reoccurred. I am scheduled for  second shot 2/2/2021. Is this a normal reaction and should I get second vaccine. I have called  Dr but have not heard back yet.

                                                Patient states that about one week after vaccination she noticed a quarter size red spot on her arm in the area where she received vaccine. Patient reports that spot on arm was painful. patient reports that arm was sore shortly after vaccination but that soreness had resolved a couple days after vaccination until this spot appeared then pain returned. Patient is under the care of doctor. I advised patient to contact doctor to notify him of reaction and to let him advise her on how to treat reaction.

On 05 Jan 2021, the patient woke up real sweaty at 3 am. She got up and went to the bathroom and passed out. The patient reported that she fell on the commode then got to the floor because she felt weak and could not walk. Once she regained her strength, she returned to bed.   On 07 Jan 2021, the patient reported that her arm was still sore at the injection site and continued to feel weak. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The events, passed out, sweaty, and couldn&#39;t walk were considered resolved on 06 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, felt weak and arm still sore at the left arm injection site, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 80-year-old female patient  with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Loss of consciousness, the non-serious listed event of Injection site pain, and the non-serious unlisted events of Asthenia, Hyperhidrosis, and Gait disturbance.

SUBSIDED OVER A PERIOD OF 72&#43; HOURS.  1 WEEK LATER THE SEVERE SORE/STIFF SITUATION REAPPEARED, COULD NOT TAKE MY NIGHTGOWN OFF THE NEXT MORNING AND COULD NOT PUT A SEATBELT ON OR DRIVE, DRY MYSELF AFTER A SHOWER, ETC.... THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

                                                got the shot on 1/17/21, really didn&#39;t have any adverse reactions until 1/27 about 10 pm, as I was getting ready for bed.  Then I noticed a  redness on right arm at site of shot, a circular redness.  This has stayed the same since the 27th.  Once in a while it has been a little itchy and warm to the touch.  Also a little touch produces a little tenderness.  No treatment yet.  Will call primary care physician on 2/01/21 if still red.

                                                Had reaction in November to tetanus vaccine.  Had flu vaccine with no reaction.  Then had this vaccine, no reaction initially, came home, feeling fine but an hour later had flushing in her left ear, just creeping over to her eye and the side of her face.  This lasted for about 15 minutes and left the feeling of something not quite right around her eye.  Nothing compared to her reaction in November from a tetanus booster.  Still has the feeling but not an adverse reaction.  Then at 10:00 PM all of a sudden her face went really hot, and presumed she had a fever, started feeling badly.  Started walking around the house, took Tylenol.  That feeling lasted for about 30 minutes and resolved.  Went to bed and did not feel anything but a funny feeling.  All symptoms have subsided except for a weird feeling around her eye.

Within 7 days it became itchy red and swollen.  Pt contacted her PCP on 2/3/2021 and she was told to take an antihistamine but she didnt take it since she has dry eyes.  She used hydrocortisone to help with the itching.

                                                I have had no adverse reactions to the injection until this morning, day 8 after the injection. Awoke this morning with itchy, red rash on upper left arm about 3-4 inches in length and 1 1/2 inches wide..Area is also warm to the touch with some swelling. It is not at injection site, but on front of upper arm. I have no fever. Initially I thought perhaps I had a bug bite, but on doing some searching on the internet found a reported phenomenon of &#34;Covid Vaccine Arm&#34; that occurs about 7-8 days after injection. I think that this may be what is occurring with me. I have cleansed the area and have been applying cortisone cream to relieve the itching.  I have had no other symptoms today.  Please note that I am registered with v-safe and have completed the daily check-ins through yesterday 2/3/2021. I did not receive a text check in today and am assuming I am now on the weekly check in schedule.

                                                I received the vaccination on 01-26-21 and on 02-03-21 my arm was itching and the next morning I noticed it was red and a small amount of swelling and a small rash.  I called my primary physician and was advised to  ice it and watch and report if if got worse.  They called to check the next day and I informed them it was about the same - no worse.  They advised to ice and call if it got worse.  Today is  Feb 6 and it is the same.  I do not leave sick otherwise.

It is now 2 days later, the itching has subsided some.  It is an area about 4 inches by 8 inches.  I tried a couple of topical treatments for the itching (the worst of the symptoms), but they did nothing.

                                                After having NO reaction for 8 days, I experienced a slightly itchy rash at vaccination site. It lasted for about 2 days. It was slightly warmer than surrounding area.  Comment: Not sure if vaccine was properly administered. It was almost half-way down to my elbow, possibly in the tricep area. I mentioned it to my nurse practitioner during a telemed visit which had  been scheduled before my vaccination. When I showed her photo of my arm with the bandaid, she thought it might not have been placed high enough on the arm. Based on location, not sure if subcutaneous or intramuscular.

White spot at injection.  Swelling and itching increased throughout the following day.  Treated with cold compress and Cortisone ointment.  No change. Spoke with my physician on 2/8/21 at 1:00 P.M.  She suggested Benedryl (sp?) ointment for the itching and said to contact her if there were any further symptoms.  The rash and itching are still with me today 2/9/21.  I am hoping that from what little information is available that the rash and itching should start to abate within the next day or 2.

                                                On 8th day after Moderna Covid 19 injection, there was a very raised, red area on left arm - felt very warm.  By the next day  the area had increased in size and some of the swelling had subsided.  Today, the third day after the reaction appeared, the redness has spread to  a large part of the outside of my upper arm - still feels warm -slight pain.  Previous to this side effect, I felt a loss of strength in my left arm during a workout. ( My concern is that this occurred so late after the injection and what it means going forward with second injection.) I have called my doctor but have not talked to him.

She did not have any problems with walking prior to the vaccine.

Treated with antibiotics:  Injection of Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) plus prescription of doxycycline hydrate 100 mg  twice a day for 10 days.  At this writing there is still some pain but very little redness.  Appears to be healing.  Diagnosis was cellulitis of left upper limb.

                                                Two weeks after receiving the vaccine, the site developed redness and intense itching. The red area was approximately the size of a quarter. The doctor recommended using Benadryl ointment and cool compresses, which I did. The site returned to normal in about 10 days.

Used cool compresses, area increased in size (2 inch oval to a 3 inch circle)  and continued through Feb 14 and 15, decreasing in intensity and size by February 16 AM.  Attempted to contact Health Department who administered vaccine.  Due to weekend and holiday, did not get anyone to talk with.  My concern is getting the second dose.  Please advise.

I began treating it with calendula cream and then Arnica which took away the itching,  Yesterday the redness started to fade but the rash got larger in area. It is still there, fainter in color and not itchy or painful but still getting larger in area.  I reported these symptoms to the pharmacist where I received the shot last Friday.

                                                Patient presented to the pharmacy questioning possible adverse reactions to the COVID vaccine. After a little discussion with a technician, I was summoned to evaluate the patient. Patient received the 1st dose of COVID vaccine on 2/11/2021; she reported significant arm tenderness in the arm that received the inoculation, however, she reported the soreness was improving. Patient&#39;s left arm appeared red &amp; warm to touch. Although it did not appear inundated and lacked tracking, I encouraged patient to contact her primary care doctor&#39;s office for evaluation. Patient followed my recommendation and I consulted with the provider. The conclusion was made that patient appears to be having an immune response to the vaccine yet. Dr also consulted with RN (immunizations)  and she reported this reaction has not been uncommon 5 dose post-vaccination. Patient was instructed to apply cold compresses now and again after receiving the 2nd dose. We do not believe any contraindication exists for the 2nd dose at this time, and patient is encouraged to receive the 2nd dose on 3/11/2021 as scheduled.

The area does not really itch, but is just red.  For the first two days, the rash didn&#39;t move.  Then over the next several days, the rash starting spreading down the upper arm. On February 18, the patient experienced bad diarrhea.  On February 21, the patient put a cold damp cloth over the area to soothe the area.  Some areas within the rash are improving, but the redness continues to spread down the arm.  The area felt like a bad sunburn, and the patient put some salve on it one day, but did not notice a difference.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

This then spread down her arm 2-3&#34;.  Did not have pain or soreness.  She went to the ER and the doctor looked at it, and she told her that she did not know if it was a reaction to the vaccine or if the are was not cleaned up right.  She then put her on an antibiotic and told her to see her doctor.  She FU with the PA and he didn&#39;t give her any further instructions.  The area has residual pinkness, warm to touch, warmer than the rest of the arm, but not much.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Six days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I noticed a rash on my left arm near the location of the shot. By the next day, the rash had spread to cover most of my upper arm as a large hive that itched badly. As of today, February 26, the large hive has not gone away and the entire area is itchy and painful. I called Dr. who  prescribed Benadryl gel for the itching and recommended that I keep my appointment for the second dose of the vaccine. He said that the reaction was not uncommon.

She also mentioned that her left arm was itchy. She asked if she could take motrin for the pain. I said yes she could take the motrin and urged her to follow up with her primary care physician.

The area affected was approximately  7 inches by 5 inches and was like that for almost three days. For the last two days it has been itching in that area,still is on and off. I did not take any medications for it. I did apply ice packs to the area fairly regularly and even heat a few times.

Then noticed my arm was a dark pink around  the site, slightly warmer than the rest of my arm and area was hard. The pink area has gotten bigger and   has started to fade; the muscle is much softer and more natural; the site itches less and less each day.

However, on the 9th day after the vax, I got &#34;COVID Arm&#34; which included upper arm swelling, red, itchy and achey at the vax site and another few days of extreme fatigue.  Today (18 days after vax) I am no longer fatigued, felt good when I woke up and I am finally getting some energy back.  The redness, swelling and itching is subsiding but is not gone totally and there is only a slight discomfort in my arm.  Moderna Vaccination #2 is on March 11 and it will be in my other arm.  Only took Aleve twice for pain.

It was quite red and hot to the touch.  It increased a bit over the next two days but is starting to fade a little bit.  I have had no itching or pain except for the usual pain from an injection in an arm. (I researched the symptom and find it is called Covid Arm)  I do have some photos of the arm if those would be helpful. I have had no other symptoms other than being more tired for a day after the vaccination.  No fever.

                                                Arm erythema noted along the lateral right upper arm; there is slight warmth over the area. Pt attempted to treat at home with Benadryl cream and cold packs. It does seem more consistent with a cellulitis than an allergic reaction, as the erythema started below the injection site.  I started her on cefadroxil 500 mg twice a day for 7 days and instructed her to hold her Keflex during this treatment course.  I also sent her some Kenalog cream for itching relief.

                                                I had my first dose of the Moderna vaccine in my left arm on Feb. 17, 2021. On Feb. 25, 2021, my left arm was itching, and I noticed a red, round spot at the site of the injection, about 2-3&#34; in diameter, warm and firm to the touch. An online search found that this has happened to others and called it &#34;COVID arm&#34; and suggested taking an antihistamine for the itching, which I did for two days. The itching was much better and, over the next week, the redness started to fade; but it&#39;s now two weeks post injection and the redness, although faded, is still there and seems to be moving down the arm. There is some itching from time to time, but not nearly as intense as it was the first time. I have no underlying conditions and have had no other side effects that I&#39;m aware of.

Second  shot on the rt. arm didn?t cause any problem.  No warm sensation on injection site. She feels heavy on lifting her left arm and pain on motion of left arm above injection site.  She has used arm sling to support lt. arm and took Advil occasionally, but no help. No fever elicited. I am very curious . Not sure what specialty dr to take her for further assessment.

                                                First 2-3 days felt normal discomfort at injection sit. It got progressively worse and began to feel like a torn rotator cuff.  A lot of pain (7-8) unable to sleep on that side and unable to lift more than two pounds or drive or reach above my shoulder without pain of about a 10 on scale of 1-10.  Saw orthapedic physician assistant  on 03/26   who gave me a steroid shot in that shoulder with 75%  relief by the next day. Still some minor residual discomfort at this writing.  Also ran a fever with nausea and headache exactly two weeks after first shot.

The rash receded until it is almost gone by Day 8.  Only other sx was itching at the injection site.  No hives, skin breaks, swelling, or lymphadenopathy.  She did call her HCP and took one dose of Benadryl with relief.   She had no incapacitation with ADL&#39;s or sensory or movement problems with her limb.     She has no hx of allergic reactions to any vaccine ingredients such as PEG.  However, she reports a history of allergy to Penicillin and statins.  She also noted she develops hives on occasion particularly after wearing wool scarves or clothing.

                                                Following the vaccine she was at the grocery store around 5:00 PM, her granddaughter asked her why her mask was red, and she noticed that she had a dripping nose bleed, and left and by the time she got home it was done.   Then, 2/21/21, she had another nose bleed, was at a pizza place in the car, and felt like she had to spit and it was blood and had a smaller nose bleed that did not last night.  The next one 2/26/21, was in the store and had a dripping nose bleed again, took a while to get it stopped, but by the time she left the store she was fine.  Then Saturday 2/27/21, she kept getting up in the night and had nose bleeds off and on, and managed through the night and the morning.  She went to the ER in the morning on 2/28/21, and her nose was packed with dissolving packing and gave her a prescription for 3 pills to take to prevent her from getting an infection.    During the night Sunday night she had a very bad night and went to the ER again on 3/1/21 at around 5:00 AM.  They then packed her nose with a balloon and then got the first prescription filled that she took.  On Wednesday she went back to the ER and they removed the balloon and now has been fine.  Her Coumadin has been up and down during this period of time.  Her INR reading was 4.5 on 2/28/21, and subsequently has gone down to where it is quite low.  No issues with the injection site.  She has never had nosebleeds prior to the vaccine.   In October/November she had a procedure she had a hernia repair and had a COVID test and since then she has had a tinge on tissue, but not a nose bleed.   These were mainly on the right until she had the profuse one, and then it was both nostrils as well as coming out of her mouth.   Has an appointment with the ENT on 3/18/21.

A week after I got a not in my throat. I went to my Dr he did an ultrasound and sent me to an ENT. The ENT did an ultrasound as well and said he would follow up with me in 3 months, but everything looked fine. The lump went away.

She developed a &#34;bronchial cough&#34; about 48 hours after receiving vaccine. She wanted antibiotics for cough from her primary care because her husband is having surgery on 3/15/21 and wanted to make sure she could go into the hospital with him. Her primary care provider prescribed her Ceftin 500 mg. She has taken Ceftin before without any allergic reaction. She said as soon as she started taking the Ceftin her entire body became itchy &#34;down to her fingers&#34; and had hives from head to toe. Also reports mild shortness of breath. Her provider was unsure whether the reaction was from the Ceftin with the vaccine or the Ceftin itself. Patient said her primary care may do some testing to find out if she is allergic to Ceftin.

Her tongue is real sore and feels as if she burnt her tongue.  The top of her gums in her mouth were all red and hurting as well.  She got real nervous and antsy.  She had this for a few days, then about 4 days later called the doctor and went to the clinic and she has canker sores in her mouth.  They told her they would probably go away in a week or two, and it was 2 weeks  yesterday from her vaccine.  They have gotten better but they are not totally gone, and her mouth still does not feel right, but does not feel as bad as it did, does not feel normal.  The tip still feels like she burnt it.  He wants to check her again around the 17th, did not give her any treatment for it.  The pharmacy wants her to recheck with her doctor in regard to getting the 2nd vaccine or not, or to get it at a doctors office to watch her more closely.

                                                I became progressively more sleepy the afternoon after the vaccination, as expected.  I did get up and make dinner, then went to bed at 9:15 p.m. on March 8th and slept until 9:15 a.m. March 9th.  I felt unstable walking into the bathroom to urinate, and even more unstable waking into the kitchen to take my meds. I passed out and woke up on the floor.  I was weak but managed to pull myself up holding on to the kitchen range. I headed for the living room sofa and passed out again, waking up on the floor by the sofa.  I&#39;m guessing I was unconscious about 2 minutes each time, but don&#39;t really know. I lay down on the sofa and called a neighbor.  He thought I should call 911, and they came and drove me to  ER .  They did an EKG, chest x-ray, and CAT scan of my brain, and drew blood.  All results were normal. I returned home that same day (March 9)  and had little energy, and ate lightly.  When I was getting in bed about 10:30 p.m. I let my head drop on the pillow and the room started to whirl around me for about six seconds.  Sometimes when I roll over in bed during the night there is a pause before   it feels like the room gives one spin.  My scalp is very tender in the large area where I hit it twice when passing out.  I&#39;m taking it easy again today, but do feel a little stronger.  I am normally exceptionally healthy for my age, and work , traveling to destinations to research and photograph my articles. Both the travel and article take stamina, and I thrive on the work.

                                                I have a hard lump about 1 1/2 inches from the site of my second moderna Covid vaccination injection site and although the initial  redness is gone I still have the same size lump and it?s been over a week since my vaccination. The nurse injected the vaccine more laterally than straight  into the muscle. I am wondering if the vaccine is collected there  and not being absorbed, or if it is some other problem... like cellulitis? it hard raised oval lump appeared one day after my vaccine. It does not meet the criteria given for ?Covid arm? (which is that the lump  would be on  the vaccination site -,mine isn?t- and that it would show up 5-6 days after the vaccination. Mine showed up the day after and has not softened or abated.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use included high blood pressure medication (not specified),  curcumin, and acetylsalicyclic acid.  On 07 JAN 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided).    On 04 FEB 2021, approximately five days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 08 Feb 2021, the patient experienced the events covid arm; mother of all covid arms; looked like hell, really bad; looked like bleeding under the skin; big area that was red and as big as the front part of arm with a wider irregular shape, about a half inch crescent, dark subcutaneous reaction; looked like bleeding under the skin; very tremendous reaction, but it does not hurt.   On 11-Feb-2011, the red subcutaneous reaction deepened and started to migrate almost immediately, and slowly migrated 5-6 inches to the bottom of the arm near the elbow. The reporter stated the reaction seemed to be getting better; it was not getting any worse, but was worried it may turn into cellulitis or gangrene. On an unknown date, the patient consulted with a dermatologist for the &#34;Covid arm&#34; and the reporter stated that the reaction was becoming systemic because the patient now had terrible itching everywhere, and they looked like a beehive stung them.  The reporter described it as a severe allergic reaction to the second vaccine dose with onset of this reaction 4-5 days after the second dose. Treatment for the events included some cream with steroids to treat the pruritus, as well as diphenhydramine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Began to experience itching on both legs including thighs on February 22, 2021. Raised red  spots then began to appear. Itching and spots then appeared on back and both arms a day later, a couple of which bled due to my scratching. Finally looked up on line (with pictures) and it appears it is a Covid rash. Treatment recommended was Benedryl and Cortizone itch cream. Started regiment 03/13/2121. Three weeks later (03/15/2121) it is still itching and raised although  my legs are better.

On January 21 around 10AM my upper left arm was itching.  upon further investigation of the area I noticed a good size red oval patch on my upper left arm located approximately 1 inch above the site of my Moderna injection site.  It was slightly itchy and was hot to the touch.  I had no fever and felt perfectly fine.  The area was not sore.  I applied an anti-itch cream and placed an inquiry with my personal doctor.  His office sent a response this morning advising me to notify the provider.  There was no information on my COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card of who to notify and I could not get through to them on their phone which is constantly busy with people calling for appointments.  I did see info saying to report adverse reactions on line at vaers.hhs.gov which is what I am doing.  My concern is whether or not I should get the second shot.

The site expanded on the next day (Friday, the 22nd), and by Sat. it was swollen. Sunday the swelling subsided and the redness expanded around my arm. By Monday the redness had moved down my arm with the upper part clearing. Tuesday the new site had swelling, and today it is not swollen but continues to be red and a little itchy. It was my only reaction with no fever but a little tiredness. (not adverse event, but just reporting my reaction to vaccine...)

                                                Starting on 1/22/21 her arm started to itch, got red circle around injection site about a quarter size, warm and hard in that area.  On 1/23/21, started to put warm compresses x 3, Sunday the same thing and by Monday it had dissipated and was fine.  Then last night 1/29/21, about 1:30 AM got up as she was not sleeping well, took two Aleve.  Woke up this morning with arm itching, red again and kind of warm.  Feels fine but that location has reappeared from the initial injection.  Pink in color and warm to touch.

When looked at it there was a red streak about 3 inches long and at least 1 inch wide radiating down from the injection site there were also hives in the red area.  Since then patient has experienced an itching that started in her head and the itching radiates down to the injection site, this has happened a couple times.  Then most recently patient has had itching all over her body, as of 1-29-2021 the redness and hives around injection site while not as red has spread it&#39;s about 6 to 7 inches long by 4 inches wide.  She has called her Doctors office the nurse there told her to call the County Health Dept who administered the vaccine.  I spoke with someone at HD on 1-29-2021 on behalf of patient (my Mom) as she was having problems reaching a person to speak with.  She told me that we needed to report to V-Safe the reactions she is having and that she would need to call her Doctor,  as they could not give recommendations on whether she should have the 2nd vaccination she is scheduled to get on 2-10-2021.  That Doctor should advise her if she should get the 2nd vaccination.  She is calling her Doctors office again on Monday.  In the mean time since this all started she has been taking Benadryl and also using hydrocortizone on the area of skin that is red and has hives around the injection site.

Nine days later my arm was swollen, itchy with center being hot, raised and red. I had no fever and no other noticeable symptoms. The next day it had spread over the upper arm and I went to emergency room. ER Dr. said she thought it was cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic. She advised me to see my primary care provider after the weekend. I went to my primary care provider and the Dr. and the N.P. agreed it was not cellulitis, but an allergic reaction due to it&#39;s appearance . In checking CDC site the Dr. found photos of vaccine reactions which looked identical to my arm. I went off antibiotics and took ibuprofhan and it slowly has returned to almost normal within 10 days.

                                                8 days after the first dose, my Mom developed a rash at the site of the injection. It lasted for about 6 days and it was the size of the palm of a hand.  She saw her primary care Doctor on 1/25/21 for a regular physical. He saw the rash (which had subsided) and advised her to take one Benadryl 30 minutes before she has the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 2/10/21.  On 1/30/21 she had an episode where her face was tingling and she was not feeling well and a somewhat out of it. Today, 1/31/21, she is feeling better but still has tingling in her face.

This lasted about 5 minutes and then subsequently resolved.  She then got up to leave and again began feeling the left chest pain, diaphoresis, and again lasting about 5 to 6 minutes and then subsequently resolving.  She does state a history of anxiety but did take Xanax this morning preventatively.  However, she states she has had similar pains in her chest over the past month.  She states these are not necessarily associated with any exertion and seemed to be somewhat better after antacids.  She notes she has not had anything to eat or drink this morning which is not unusual for her and her blood sugar was 117 this morning.

                                                Immediately after the injection, I experienced an irregular small light red patch at the injection site about 3 inches by 2 inches.  I had pain and mild itching at the injection  site for two days and then the pain and itching stopped and the red patch faded.  Seven days later, in the evening of February 9th,  the red patch returned  and it was darker and became larger - round, about 3 inches across.  It was slightly swollen and warm to the touch.  It was accompanied by intense itching, but no pain.  This skin reaction has been lasting for two days now.  My doctor, by phone, recommended Benadryl but I don&#39;t have that in the house and we&#39;re having a snow storm and I can&#39;t go out to get it.  I took Extra Strength Tylenol before bed last night and it relieved the itching.

                                                Eight days after I received the first vaccination, (01/28/2021)I awakened early in the a.m. with painful itching and redness in the deltoid region of my upper left arm. Throughout the day, I experienced swelling and more redness that surrounded the injection site. The size around the injection area was about 3 inches.  I called the place where I received the vaccination and was told it could be the Delayed Cutaneous Hypersensitivity that is known to occur in some patients 5 to 9 days after the vaccination. I received the injection on 01/20/2021.  I was told to apply an ice pack and/or take Tylenol for pain.  The swelling was resolved in two days.

The pain in my arm continued  throughout the 12th and 13th necessitating being on pain relievers. By the evening of the 13th , a 3&#34; red swollen area became apparent .  The pain continued which was annoying but did not limit my activities .   I remain puzzled as to why I responded as I did when I hadn&#39;t before; it almost appears I have a cystitis issue now.

I am now 4 days out from the initial symptoms and it is still reddish but fading in spots.  The itching has continued but is mild. I have pictures she took and pictures I took and they look almost identical.  I called my primary care and the nurse assured me that it was common and would abate in a week.  I took antihistamine for two nights.

The itches goes down from my shoulder to my elbow on my left arm and my right arm the itching goes from the shoulder to the wrist. My  left arm is also red around the area where I got the shot and was swollen, this lasted about 2-3 days then it went away. In the last couple of days the redness came back and puffiness came back. I do not see any bumps but when I feel my arms they bumps. I did try to put some anti-itch cream which helped with the itching but I quit putting the cream on it as I worried if it would react with the vaccine.

                                                Suddenly this morning, 13 days after receiving the first Covid Moderna vaccine - my arm is red and feverish at injection site.  In the meantime starting Sunday, Feb. 14th, I had pain in right chest and right upper back, that I contributed to making a wrong move and straining muscles.  The back pain is better, but I still have it when I reach high , move wrong, or take a deep breath.

The second day she shaking and jerking, couldn&#39;t hold on to anything.  Her blood pressure was up and down that day. She said she felt like she was dying and then she vomiting where she bruised both elbows on the toilet bowl due to the jerking movement she was experiencing.  She took a nap and woke up confused.  She was hallucinating saying she felt like she went from a small box to a blue box to red box and didnt recognize her room.  Her sitter said her eyes were glazed but was able to recognize her sitter at that time.  Blood pressure dropped so the sitter then called EMTs where they checked her out.  Vital signs were good but she declined to be transported to the hospital via ambulance.  The third day she was feeling some better where she was able to eat and get a sponge bath.  Fourth day she was better so was able to shower.  She states she is better now with just a little soreness and redness around the injection site.   Pt has contacted her PCP and spoke with the nurse about her symptoms.

Today I am fine.

The patient stated she was seen today in the ER today for a rash she developed on her arm where she received the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago. The patient stated she started itching on her right deltoid 4 days ago and since then the rash has progressed down and around her bicep. The patient stated that the rash was not painful and therefore, the doctor did not think it was cellulitis but prescribed the antibiotic just in case. I thanked the patient for letting me know and I informed her that I would be reporting the reaction to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

That night I didn&#39;t sleep at all. So that night I called the doctor and I went to the doctor Friday morning, and was diagnosed with the worst case of Shingles she had ever seen. She prescribed prednisone on a taper, Valtrex (generic) 1 gram tablet 3x daily for one week, and topical ointment (flutisone propionate) .005 strength twice daily, and 500 mg tylenol every six hours.

The pain started around 2/19/21 and has improved but still present. On 2/28/21 patient noticed a red rash about the size of a half dollar at the injection site. She had not looked at site prior and is unsure if rash was present earlier. Patient asked me to report to VAERS as she does not have internet access and would prefer not to make the phone call herself.

The site (on my lower backside) tingles and warns me of what is coming. This was different. No warning. Two bumps (or lumps) were there where they always appear. I haven&#39;t had an outbreak for at least 6 months. My feeling is that is came on from the vaccine, though I have no proof other than it came after the shot. It may have come on earlier than 7 a.m., but I wasn&#39;t aware of it until I woke up. I usually take valacyclovir 500 mg when it starts but I am going to wait a few days as I don&#39;t want it to interfere with the vaccine. However I will check with my doctor to get his advice.

                                                First dose was in the right arm and it it became inflamed about a week after the shot. Itchy, hot, inflamed, and pink. I visited the doctor advised warm compresses and the problem subsided in a few days. After the second dose I woke up in the middle of the night with the chills and chattering teeth. It was uncontrollable shaking. My temperature of 102 degrees in the morning. I had shooting pains in my arms and legs. Felt terrible all day. Took Tylenol no effect. Advil worked better.  The lymph nodes were sore under my arm. On the third day I felt a little better but on the fourth day I felt a little better.

                                                By afternoon I felt a little chilly and achy and took Tylenol.  I woke at 2:00am the following morning to go to the restroom and my dog needed to go out.  I felt light headed as soon as she was back in the house.  I felt things going dark and I passed out in the hallway.  I don&#39;t know how long I was out but when I came to, I felt like I couldn&#39;t move.  I laid there for a while and finally crawled back to my bed.  I was able to get back in bed.  By then it was 3:00am.  The next night I woke in the night and had an irregular heartbeat.  I could not get back to sleep until it finally went away.  For several days after the vaccination, I had very little energy.

Another week later, (two weeks after the shot)I called the doctor&#39;s office, spoke to a nurse. Rash &amp; slight itchy sensation continues, mainly on chest......may be subsiding.  Seemingly no other adverse effects.  She suggested that I do get the second shot.

Ten days after, I woke up to swelling redness and hives covering my upper left arm to the elbow. Waited 24 hours to see if it would disappear and when it didn&#39;t, I then went to the doctors office. I was seen by the nurse/practitioner who gave me a steroid shot  and advised me not to continue with the vaccine program. Everything healed up in a couple of days and I continued with the vaccine program , receiving my second dose on January 28th. with no reaction.

                                                I developed a rash 10 days after receiving the 2nd dos of the Covid Moderna Vaccine.  There a red spots, blisters, and it itches. The rash is primarily on the arms and on the neck and upper back.  It started at night, it got a little better during the day , then came back the next night.  I  still have it.  The doctor recommended an antihistamine Hydroxyzine HCL, which I took today.

                                                Red, itchy area about 6x4 left arm;  severe cold and sleepy started next day and lasted  about 8 hours then went away.  Had no fever.  Later about 10 pm I got up to go to bathroom and my legs just gave out.  I could not move my legs or feet at all.  Called paramedics who got me up and walked me for at least 30 minutes.  I was very weak and unsteady.  I did improve slowly.  By morning I could walk cautiously.   Seem to be ok now.

I called my doctor and she advised me to put and ice pack on it, take an antihistamine and put Calamine lotion on it.  After 4 days it seems to be getting better.

It is warm to the touch and is firmer that the areas not affected.  It itches a little but has not caused and other symptoms or problems.  I started to rub the area and it seems to grow bigger like there is a pocket of liquid just under the skin.

It is 13 hours after the rash appeared it is still there and is now around 2 inches by 3 inches.  It itches. I don&#39;t think this is an emergency i am reporting it because I think it is unusual and want to know if I should be concerned. I don&#39;t know whom to ask.  Also, can I still get a second shot at the same site?

No temp, etc.  Started Benadryl took 2 the first night, and then took on 1/27/21 took three, morning, noon or evening.  It was not as red then 1/26/21.   Hurts a little today, sore around the area.

On Jan 18, 2021, developed a circular rash, approx 3? long and1 and 1/2? wide in vicinity of the vaccination.  Rosy colored, warm with a hard spot in the middle.  Painful at first, then itchy.  Rash began fading slightly next day, Jan 19, and became itchy but not painful.  Lasted several days, continuing to fade and become less itchy.   By Jan 23, just very mild pink discoloration and very mildly sensitive to the touch.  Then disappeared all together.  The entire episode resembled something like a bee bite.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine my arm was sore to the touch this lasted a few days. About 6-7 days later it was itchy so I looked at it and it big red circle. This lasted for a few days and it went away.  I went to my doctor and they said it looked like it was a skin allergy and suggested to take Claritin and Tylenol for pain.     I received the 2nd shot 1/28/2021 - and I did not have any reactions with that dose.

Day 7 pm red, swollen , itchy red spot size a little larger than golf ball and slight headache .  This lasted 5 days with red area 31/2? wide and feeling tired and slight headache.  Days 12and 13 all symptoms vanish.  This morning, 2/05/2021 my arm is again 3? area red, itchy, slight headache and fatigue.  I hear that this called Covid arm and seems to affect about  .06 % of those who have had the Moderna vaccine.  I thought I should report this because my husband who had the same injection had no symptoms at all...not even redness at the site.

Went home and took Benadryl (50 mg) 2 tablets at 9:30 am,1:30 pm and 5:15 pm, mistakenly believing they were 25mg tabs because of packaging change and miniscule text on bottle and difficult to find directions. Also Prednisone 60 mg, 10:00 am. Took 2 Tylenol (650 mg) 12:45pm and5:20 pm. I did not realize that the Benadryl dosage was different! Actually double! So I took 300 mgs of Benadryl.

When my daughter FaceTime?d me and realized I was slurring my words. She phoned her sister to do a wellness check.    2021 Covid Vaccine   They found me still incoherent and unsteady. I did not realize that the bottle of Benadryl was a different dosage! Dr.  office and spoke to doctor on call. They suspected steroid psychosis.

Consulted by phone with primary care giver&#39;s office and got a return call from nurse relaying conversation with Dr. Described as minor reaction and go ahead with planned second shot. Rash slowly disappeared. 2nd shot on 01/13/2021 and rash began appearing by end of next day. Rash area continued to enlarge and no lump in throat this time. Very itchy and rash on larger area than with 1st shot and is more solidly red. Plan on continuing to watch but no medical attention seems necessary at this time.

                                                Three days after receiving vaccine, patient noticed rash, which turned to whelps on joint areas.  This included patient&#39;s wrists, knees, buttocks and ankles.  She noticed that where pressure was applied and bending was occurring, the itchy whelps would show.    Patient  took oral Benadryl which calmed itching and redness and saw primary care Dr. as well as rheumatologist for reaction.  Triamcinolone was prescribed and patient used to calm itch.  This reaction continued to occur for two weeks after the first vaccine.  She received her second dose and the same reaction occurred and continues to occur at this time.   Lot# for second Moderna vaccine is 013M20A, given on 2/12/2021.

                                                I had my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Feb. 10, 2021. I had about three days of chills, aches, headache, very sore arm. etc. On Feb. 22,2021 a red area  about 3 or 4 inches around the site of the injection was noticed. It was itchy and uncomfortable. I spoke to my internist and allergist. There is some disagreement about whether I should take the second dose.  I have taken benadryl and tylenol. Both doctors said it was unusual for such a reaction 2 days after receiving the vaccine. What information do you have about rashes occurring so long after the vaccination? What is the recommendation about the second vaccine? Thank you.

Used Calamine lotion.  It was semi-effective for a short duration.  If scratched, the skin would turn blotchy and red.   24 hours later purchased OTC antihistamine which provided relief for 24 hours.   I took the antihistamine again the second 24 hours.  The itching didn&#39;t return after that.

Dr there glanced at my arm and said it was an infection  and gave me antibiotic, Cephalexin 500mg, 10 days.  Feel really bad but maybe better today and that  is after tramadol and tylenol. Headaches. Tylenol helps.. now afraid to take 2nd shot.

By the next day it was and itchy red area about 4 to 5 inches long and two inches wide.  Gradually went away until 23 February when I awoke with a pinkness in the area where the red patch had been plus a red line around that area and including  an extended bit below it maybe 2&#34; long and 1&#34; wide.  Hard to explain.  I have photos if you should wish.

Severe diarrhea all over floor and self.   Was not found until Saturday afternoon, and was transported to the ER by ambulance.  Remained in hospital Saturday evening until Monday afternoon.  As of today, the following Friday the 12th, she is still weak and unsteady at times, where she was previously ambulating fine with adequate energy.  Still feels like she has no strength.

                                                I woke with my arm itching at the vaccination site.  Later it became red.  The next day my arm had a swath of redness, heat, and itch from my shoulder to my elbow.  This was a Saturday and my doctor&#39;s office was closed.  Since I did not have a fever and felt fine except for the arm, I decided to wait until the doctor&#39;s office returned my call.  By Monday, I could clearly see that the problem was resolving itself, so I did not see the doctor.  By Tuesday, it was entirely back to normal.

During her waiting time, she started to experience pain going down her right arm and the arm turned colder than usual.  This is when her caregiver alerted our staff and was attended to by Dr.    APRN also came to monitor her.  I also started talking with her and monitored her during this time.  We asked her to wait for an additional 30 minutes.  I let her know I would follow up with her this afternoon as well.  We let her know that if she has any other allergic reactions or had any problems with breathing, facial swelling, etc then she should contact 911 or enable her medical emergency alert device.  She acknowledged.

                                                Had a red rash/spot come on left arm at injection site nine (9) days after injection date.  It started about 2-1/2 inches x 3-1/2 inches and has grown to about 3 inches x 4 inches (maybe little more).  It has a darker red rim around it and has become lighter in the center .  It is a little bumpy where it grows and gets more red.  It might itch a little--not much.  I have been putting hydrocortisone cream on it.  My concern is that it is getting larger.

                                                Eight days after the first injection, I noticed for the first time a reddish blotch near the site of the injection.  The day after it had spread downward, the next day the redness seems to have diminished some, but it still covers the same area.   The redness was warm to the touch, and hard,  but not painful.  The area felt like the size of the palm of my hand.  I did not run a fever.  I realize that redness is one of the side effects, but my concern is that it didn&#39;t occur immediately; rather, one week later.

I took a 20mg benedryl and went to bed.  I woke up this morning with severe itching and a red arm at the injection site.   Prior to yesterday and todays reaction, I did not experience anything except a sore arm. It is 9:00am, I  am waiting to see how I feel, if it becomes necessary to contact my Dr. ????time will tell.

                                                Had a rash about 4&#34; long by 2&#34; wide. Occurred about 5 days after the first vaccination. It is fading and less itchy over time. Had the first vaccination 1/14 and scheduled for the second on 2/11. Should I take the second vaccination as scheduled? Are there any meds  or herbs or supplements or food I shouldn&#39;t take before the vaccination?

                                                Shoulder pain within 10 min. after shot.  Rash started the next day. Waited till Saturday, the 29th to see a doctor., and she diagnosed that I had Shingles. She gave me two medicines to get from my druggist. One was valacyclovir and the other was HYDORcodone. These helped to relieve the pain. I was limited to  5 of the HYDROcodone,  so when I was finished with those tablets, my nighttime pain in my shoulder was very uncomfortable.

She stated she developed about 1/4 inch red spot on or near (within 2 inches) vaccination site. The spot was very itchy and was localized to that area only. The patient first noticed the area the morning after the vaccination (on 2-5-21). Also, the patient reported this morning (2-6-21) she had developed severe diarrhea. She was not able to attribute the diarrhea to anything else within her diet or otherwise. The patient stated that the red spot and itching had subsided since yesterday, but she still is experiencing minor itching. I advised the patient to try Imodium in the meantime to combat the diarrhea and to monitor the site as well as the diarrhea for improvement; however, if no improvement or worsening of symptoms is seen within the next 2 days to contact her PCP for further evaluation/treatment.

                                                From the patient&#39;s chart (regarding the vaccination on 02/03/2021): &#34;The nurse states that when she gave the injection that upon exit of the needle there was some bleeding. This was stopped with a Band-Aid. After the vaccination there was a slight area of erythema that may be more contusion or bruising from the injection. The area is not tender but we will need to keep a watch on this. The patient was told to elevate this and put some ice to this for the next hour or so. Waiting 15 minutes after the injection for evaluation and other side effects was unremarkable.&#34;  The patient later stated that the injection site got somewhat warm on the day of the vaccination after she received the vaccine. She stated that she placed some ice packs on her arm for about 15 minutes on that day and that she and the injection site had no issues or adverse reactions after that. - 02/10/2021  &#34;I tried reporting this today electronically but was unable to submit it because the website would not let me submit it.

I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

I googled search and found it was a rare but real reaction vaccine, called COVID ARM. According to the information I read it occurs between 7-9 days after vaccination. Mine occurred exactly 7 days later. I have been putting Hydrocortisone cream with Aloe in it and on it. Today it is more sore then itching and still red. The Hydrocortisone with Aloe seemed to help.   I have also noticed my eyes have been watering a lot more since receiving the vaccine.

                                                About five days after receiving first COVID shot I felt itchiness in left arm. Then I noticed large three large red blotches  from  almost shoulder to  about six inches from elbow.  They became a darker pink and outlined in red.  They were very itchy for several days, but otherwise I felt fine.  As of today I still have the blotches, but they seem to have faded a bit (red outline still visible) and the itchiness is much less.

Woke from sleep about 3:00 AM the next morning itching in  all over both arms (all over), face, and eyes. Took 1/4 of a 25mg Benidryl tab and maybe 30 min later went back to sleep. Symptoms were still present the next day and I did not feel well. Took more Benadryl 25mg tab every 4 hrs and symptoms were gone the next day (Tuesday).  Monday, 2/22/2021, had a virtual appointment with a physician and spoke with her about this reaction.

The red site itched and hurt a bit when touched.  (Note: I took a Benedryl pill and put some Cortozone-10 ointment on the circle the second day after the injection when the circle appeared.) That day and the next the tissue within the red, 3-inch diameter circle got progressively harder - it felt as firm/hard as a golf ball. (I took another Benedryl pill the third day after the injection, but switched to Benedryl ointment, which worked better for the itch than the Cortizon had.)

                                                I developed chills later that evening. I took Tylenol and went to bed. Middle of the night I had chills again and took more Tylenol. In the morning I had a fever of 102. I took Tylenol every 6 hours and in-between doses I had headaches and chills as the Tylenol wore off. 6:30 am the next day I had a fever just below 100. My arm is also warm and achy and I have body aches.

After a few minutes I pulled up my sleeve and noticed small red spots forming, It  was splotchy  over a  little over an  inch wide and long.  I watched this and it continued but was more annoying than anything.  Later in afternoon it was spreading to a wider area and was showing a brighter redness.  By 11 p.m. the coloring had spread and my upper arm felt warm to the touch and had swollen some.  I slept fairly well, woke up and it had increased in size .  Wednesday  morning  the redness was bright red and much of the upper arm was affected.  I called Dr. office and saw Dr. not my usual doctor..

The area where injection was given was lower than usual about 5 &#34; from shoulder joint..   Saw MD for regular check up and he commented then &#34; thats where they gave you your injection.?&#34;  Have been applying heat compresses and cold packs alternating.  Today still has some discomfort on touch but not painful like it was and swelling has decreased but still slightly purple.   Md stated she was doing what would help and to take Ibuprofen or tylenol. This was the 2nd injection for the Covid 19.

                                                Daughter   provided the information for her elderly mother who, at this time, was being evaluated in the ED at Medical Center .   3/5/21 -  approximately 16.5 hrs after her mother&#39;s second dose of Covid 19 vaccination, she woke up very weak and felt very tired.  3/6/21 Patient noticed rash (not raised) but reddened in the left upper arm where the injection was given.  She stated it was oval in appearance and covered most of the upper arm.  She noted a lump in her underarm of the left axilla also.  Denied any fever or other symptoms and otherwise felt fine.  On 3/9/21 she noticed a lump in the groin area and noticed that walking was a little more difficult than usual since both of her knees bothered her.  3/12/21Pt went to orthopedic surgeon and had a &#34;cortisone injection&#34; in the right knee.   This afternoon, the patient&#39;s daughter suggested that she go a local Urgent Care because the patient stated that the lump (previously in groin area)  &#34;was moving.&#34;  She waited in there for over one hour and then a nurse came out and told her to go to the ED for evaluation of her left upper arm for the redness and swelling.  She went directly to the ED and is being evaluation and having bloodwork done.  Daughter said if the lab results are normal, her mother will be discharged with an oral antibiotic and benadryl

                                                I had no effect until  after i went to sleep.. After midnight i awoke to itching all over. By morning my eyes were closed to slits and beneath my eyes were  bags as large as teabags, i also had a low grade fever, aches and pains and extreme fatigue. This lasted for a while so ,on Feb 2.. I went to the doctor who gave me a steroid shot. On the 4th  i was not as  achy though still tired and the bags under my eyes persisted ...My eyes were  still itchy and almost closed... She gave me another steroid shot.. i was also advised not to get second steroid shot by several doctors, a doctor and a Immunologist.. also advised against getting second dose. The fatigue remains and the swelling under eyes remains though not as pronounced as it was at first. I would like to be safe. Is the johnson and johnson an option for me? I would not like after effects Please get back to me with some suggestions and advice as to my being fully safe. thank you.

                                                March 7, 2021 at about 6:30 p.m. I had two spells where I had no control over my body.  I fell and could not get up.  I had no strength and was unable to get up.  Each time it only lasted a few seconds or minutes.  It was sort of like I fainted but stronger.  I had spent most of the day resting as I had a very bad headache but that was about gone when I had the two spells.  I had also had a small patch of hives (fever and swelling) about the size of my hand at the site of the shot.  That lasted about a week after each shot.   I thought this was something I should report.  Thanks.

She said within 3 days her legs started to go numb and especially her thigh muscles and her veins in her left foot were engorged. She said she went to the ER and they rxed 40mg prednisone for 4 days and her papers from the ER read &#34;allergy.&#34;  When I spoke to her for the second time and advised her she does not qualify for a second moderna vaccine, patient said that when she went to the ER she went for abdominal swelling, leg swelling, leg numbness, and swelling of the left ankle and foot. I confirmed with her that her symptoms have all improved and she said &#34;yes, tremendously.&#34; She said she spoke to her PCP and at least one additional doctor yesterday.

The rash migrated down and forward toward the bicep about the 5th day and was about 6&#34; in length. I had been applying Benadryl gel to the rash. The third day of the rash, the fifth day after the shot,  I called the doctor&#39;s office. He recommended I take Benadryl oral tablets as recommended on the package.  After two days of  taking oral Benadryl the rash was significantly reduced and I quit taking the Benadryl.  Since then, I have seen COVID arm online which looks very much like mine did.

The area was slightly swollen, hot to touch, burning, itchy, and slightly painful.  The next day, the symptoms had spread to 3 inch diameter in size.  Starting on the 10th day the symptoms gradually decreased until by the 12th day, the area had decreased in size and  it was only slightly red and itchy.

Soreness and itching continued. I applied cortizona ointment and took bendryl inn hopes it would disappear. After weeks of area continuing to grow now about 4 X 6 inches , severe itching, reddness and sore arm with some pin pricking sensations, I decided to see my  physician at facility I received injections.  I was prescribed methylpred tab 4mg, a prednisone med for 5 days. Today I took my first tablet in the morning. I can however let you know if the treatment helped after I am finished with meds.

That evening she started feeling really bad and knew she was having a shingles flair again.  Reports she was nave able to finish her shingles vaccine series because she developed shingles a week after her first vaccination.   She was still within the 6 month period to wait to get the second dose when this occurred.  She called her doctor who advised her it was ok to take her antiviral for the shingles and that she could still get her second injection for the COVID vaccine.

                                                The injection did sting, but didn&#39;t think anything about it. For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

On January 14th she states she woke up to her deltoid red, swollen and itching.  She has been applying cortisone cream for the itching to the site.  Today she has noticed a darker red linear line that is also in the reddened oval on her arm She came in today (01/19/2021) and I observed a large reddened area (approximately 5cm)  to her Right Deltoid.  I also marked the area to see if the redness goes outside of the circle.  Encouraged client to start applying cool compresses to the affected area.

It looked like there were 2 giant hives on my my arm (bigger than a nickel). Took 1 Benedryl (25mg), which didn&#39;t help. Hardly slept due to itching, and soreness to the touch. I can&#39;t wear a blouse with a sleeve. Today (Sunday 1/24), the redness came together into 1 big red blotch, measuring  2&#34;x3.5&#34;. Hot to the touch, and very sensitive. I feel pain into my shoulder blade area and where my arm meets my body in the front. Also, pain going towards my elbow. Ice / cold packs make it feel better. I will call for Dr. appointment tomorrow (Monday morning).

Called Health Dept. and talked with .  She suggested hot compresses on area.  She gave me your number to call.  I used the compresses along with benedril cream several times a day from the 24th to present (Jan. 28).  Itching has just about stopped and lump and redness have gone.

                                                On January 29,2021 at about 9 am I experienced extreme total body weakness as though I was about to faint. I managed to lie down. Concurrent with the extreme weakness I felt intense nausea. The weakness and nausea lasted for approximately 45 minutes to one hour when I had to rush to the toilet for a bowel movement. Within an hour to an hour and one half I was totally asymptomatic. There was no recurrence of the GI symptoms or exteme weakness. At the same time I felt itching at the site of the Covid 19 vaccination. When the GI symptoms and weaknes subdided and I looked at my upper left arm, there was swelling and redness surrounding the vaccination site and around the side of my left arm. The itching, swelling and redness lasted for 24 hours and began to subsdide until it was only faintly recognizable as a light pink discoloration around the original vaccination site. Today, February 6th, 2021 the redness has almost completely faded.

                                                After several days her arm felt itchy, looked in the mirror and had a rash around the site, just little red dots. The area got worse, she made an appointment for a dermatologist for the next day.  It doubled in size, and then doubled again and as an artist it was interesting.  Her husband researched the symptoms and said that it&#39;s COVID arm and it&#39;s usually typical in people in their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s.   She went to the Dermatologist on 2/11/21 who said that it&#39;s at the site of the injection.  He told her to take Cortisone for that day, Clobetasol 0.5%.  She did that for the day, and he sent in a prescription to start the next day hydrocortisone 2.5% cream 2-3 days a day.  It got much worse.  Today it is a brownish area, fading, the redness has gone as well, itchy at times as well.   She does have pictures that she is willing to submit.

                                                Within about 20 minutes, pt began to feel dizzy, had a headache and had tightness in chest.  Her blood pressure and pulse were normal. She had water and cold compress. I sat with her and her caretaker for another 15 minutes or so.  The caretaker left to bring car around and we used wheelchair to help her to car.  She never did pass out, and was feeling a little better.  The caretaker was going to stay with her to keep a watch over her.  Patient called a couple of hours later to let us know she was doing ok and had been lying down.  She wasn&#39;t having the chest tightness anymore and her head felt better, but she had developed a rash across the chest.

                                                With the second dose I experienced itching and what it feels like a swollen mass on my left arm. I could push it and it would move around my arm. Like a little ball. It was hot to the touch. I also developed cellulitis on my left arm but not at the injection site, lower (medium anterior lateral part of my left arm).  I decided to go to the ER to get it checked and they told me it was cellulitis. They prescribed me Augmentin and it did the trick, 48 hrs after starting the Augmentin it was much better and now it is all gone. The little moveable lump in my arm is much smaller but I can still feel it if I press it.

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

She was not concerned due to it not causing any discomfort. Hydrocortisone with aloe topical cream was recommended.

                                                5-6 days after the injection right upper arm started to itch. Skin had turned bright pink and looked like a rash but was smooth. The pink color extended from my right shoulder halfway down to my elbow and wrapped around the entire upper arm in a band that measured about 6 inches wide. The whole area itched but not constantly or too  intensely. Itching lasted nearly a week. The arm is no longer bright pink, but can tell where the skin  was inflamed. Informed the head pharmisist at location and my family doctor. The pharmist said it was probably an allergic reaction and I should notify my doc, the doc said it was a sign that my body was developing antibodies. It was a little scary and I&#39;m not looking forward to the shot on 3/10/21!!

                                                Sizable redness/rash  in arm about 2&#34; below the injection site and was very itchy and warm and swollen.  This persisted for several days and became very red.  My physician worried about possible cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic (Doxycyline HYC 100 mg) (7 days).  I did not have a fever.  After the antibiotic the symptoms largely disappeared.  My physician was astonished that the shot was in the same arm as the first shot, especially because there was a very small redness after the first shot.  She reasoned that the effects from the first shot are magnified in the second shot and has patients with similar responses when given the second shot in the same arm as the first shot.  The nurse asked where the first shot was given and then asked in which arm I wanted the second shot and, unaware of the risk, I said in the same arm.  My physician recommended that the normal protocol should be that the second shot be administered in the opposite arm unless there is a compelling reason not to do it.

                                                Patient had a reaction on 3/3/21, one day after 3/2/21 Nivolumab (immunotherapy tenth cycle) dose for her melanoma treatment and second Moderna vaccine was given on 2/28/21. She&#39;d had her first Moderna vaccination with the same timing- three days prior- to her 9th Nivolumab infusion. She did not have any prior symptoms after the Moderna vaccines were given.  On 3/3/21 the arm where the vaccine was given became swollen, red, and hot.  She developed a severe sinus headache and sinus congestion with no fluid draining.  The headache pain was more severe than she&#39;d ever experienced and was not like a migraine. &#34;It hurt to blink.&#34; She was sick through 3/7 with symptoms progressing to fatigue &#34;too tired to write a note&#34; and nausea and &#34;violent&#34; dry heaves.  The symptoms resolved quickly and completely on Sunday 3/7/21 and she felt well for the days after.

On 01-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 01-Feb-2021, the patient experienced RHINORRHOEA (Runny nose), VACCINATION SITE INDURATION (hard area at injection site), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (tender to touch the injection site) and VACCINATION SITE SWELLING (left arm swelling). On 15-Feb-2021, the patient experienced FAECES DISCOLOURED (tarry black diarrhea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), PERIPHERAL SWELLING (swollen foot) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and VOMITING (vomiting) (seriousness criterion hospitalization).

No treatment information regarding other events was available.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case of an 83-year-old female patient who experienced inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered after first dose of mRNA-1273 (58 days). Based on temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and onset of the events of runny nose, vaccination site induration, pain and swelling, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  There is not enough information to assess the other events due to lack of critical details in patient&#39;s medical history. Additional information is being requested.

                                                Moderate soreness/redness and slight itching noticed at injection site within 24 hours after receiving injection but I did not do a visual inspection until several days later when these symptoms became irritating and troublesome. I outlined the area of irritation with a marking pen and when I inspected it about 24 hours later, the erythema had increased to cover almost all the distance from shoulder to elbow but remained confined largely to the dorsal aspect of my upper arm. No soreness remains but itchiness continues and this is. I have taken liquid diphenhydramine at bedtime for the last three nights and used a topical anti-itch cream occasionally but have avoided any other treatment or medications. Itching and redness continue and expansion of the afflicted area continue 11 days post injection.

In addition, I had wheezing and a feeling of &#34;bubbles&#34; in my chest. My arm was very hot and tender at the injection site.  I slept through the rest of the night but awoke feeling extremely weak and confused. As a result, I spent the day in bed. I had no appetite, as well. The next day, I had coughing bouts off and on and still don&#39;t feel myself.

                                                some bruising near my eye; area was a little tender; Afib started to act up; blacked out; Hit forehead on the door jamb; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was a 84-years-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced area was a little tender, Afib started to act up, blacked out, hit forehead on the door jamb and had some bruising near eye.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had no pain or soreness, but the area was a little tender if you pushed, and she waited one hour in the hospital afterwards.  As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again. Consent given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, area was a little tender and had some bruising near eye, were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 84 year old female patient with medical history including atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

I was given steroids - A large shot and then subsequent pills lowering the dosage each day.    The rash first appeared on my arms and was very uncomfortable. It moved to include my chest, neck, back, underarms and thighs. Very uncomfortable. Barely a fever.   Went to my dematologist who prescribed Triamcinolone 1% cream, Allegra (or Zyrtec).  Also Hydroxyzine at night and by the middle of each night it was too uncomfortable to sleep.  After 8 days I am finally considerably better but not clear.

After getting up from bed and eating her usual breakfast, she was returning to her bedroom when she became dizzy and fainted, falling to the floor, hitting her head and suffering other effects, including rhabdomyolysis from being on the floor for a long time after the fall as she was unable to get up. She was transported to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days. She was treated with IV fluids, Tylenol and a short course of antibiotics. While hospitalized, she had a repeat of a rash/swelling at injection site that began about 48 hours after vaccination.

I was surprised because the initial soreness had gone away.  Later, when I looked at my arm in the mirror, I saw a rough-looking blochy rash area where the shot had been given  and it extended around the arm and down toward my elbow.

I went to my doctor and who diagnosed the rash as bacterial and prescribed an antibiotic  Cephalexin 500mg.  As of this time, Feb. 28, 2021 at 1:23PM the rash has subsided - not gone, just less - and the itching is almost gone too.  I take the medicine 4 times a day for a total of 7 days , this being day 3.

She started having swelling, redness, chills, muscle aches, pains, fever (99.3), SOB, and fatigue. Her SOB is requiring her use more O2 than normal. Today she still has swelling, redness and soreness around the injection site that is worse than on the first day. Her PCP came to see her yesterday on 3/2/2021 and they told her that her symptoms meant that her immune system was working.  Care giver would recommend her to go to the ER if her symptoms persisted.

She started getting a rash - started 7 days after 2nd dose of vaccine At last visit, we did testing for vasculitis after the rash looked more vasculitic to me; ANCA testing was positive, as was ANA.  - 17 days after 2nd vaccine She was given prednisone 20 mg taper over the last 8 days.  She is feeling much better in terms of her rash and swelling.   She is having surgery on the 29th for her BCC on the left eyelid. She is noticing blurred vision in both eyes since this all started and she is mentioning this to the eye doctor when she sees them. She says her head was fuzzy when this started and this is better but is still &#34;fuzzy sometimes&#34; Her renal function was normal.  Her CBC was mildly elevated WBC but otherwise normal.  She denies any breathing problems, blood in stools or blood in urine, or neurologic symptoms other than the fuzzy head.

                                                I noticed significant swelling and increased pain at the injection site when I went to bed. (The deltoid area had swollen a bit by the first night after injection, so this was the second night. ) I took  an OTC sleep aid (50 mg diphenhydramine) and drifted off by 1 am. At 3 am I awoke, whether due to my usual   polynocturia or the vaccination reaction I can&#39;t say. My upper body, especially my arms and hands, was violently shaking and I had a blinding headache--and likely a fever, too. After that, I awoke at 4, 5, 7 and 8 am, during which time the shaking and headache subsided. I was very tired and my whole body was sore, so I went back to bed and slept until 10 am. By midafternoon, I was back to normal.

Felt like her face was drawn and tight. This morning, she has been very shaky, sounds like some congestion in her chest (cough), very tired, very dry mouth. She is never sick, so this is alarming to her and to me.

These symptoms resolved with an antihistamine a topical hydrocortisone.  On Day 8 following injection she developed a large inflammation on the outer aspect of her left arm that ran from her shoulder to her elbow.  It was itchy, achy, and sensitive to the touch.  She was treated with additional antihistamines, acetaminophen, and topical triamcinolone.  The reaction is currently resolving.

I took a Benadryl last night to help with the itching and today it is not as red. It is a little sore minor soreness as well.   I seen Dr. at Clinic this morning,  she said it looked pretty good and if I wanted to maybe I should delay getting the 2nd dose for another a week. Otherwise I look good and healthy.

There was no redness induration or other findings at the immunization site, all findings were distal to the elbow, and they included a very mild erythematous streak from the antecubital fossa to the wrist as well as mild to moderate edema on the volar aspect of the forearm. The symptoms were improving with Tylenol and application of topical Aspercreme at the patient had started prior to my evaluation on 2/1/2021.I could not explain the relationship to her vaccination, but felt it necessary due to the timing and fact it was in the same extremity as the immunization was given that I should report this

A couple of days later she started breaking out in red spots on her back in the same area where the pain was.  She went to the doctor and was told that she has shingles.  She has had all of the shingles vaccines.  Given medicine for the shingles, Valtrex and the shingles have now dried up.   Everything is on the left side of her body where she had the vaccine.  She is now recovered from the vaccine and the shingles as of today 2/10/21.

The pain I have experienced has been short pains which radiate up into my neck.  I was told that one one the side effects could be a knot but this is a slight swelling  which leaves the upper right arm puffy.  The only medication that I have taken for pain is Aleve.

I then used the toilet and started walking back to bed (less than 20 feet away). About halfway there, I I realized something was wrong. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground right next to my bed. On the way down I think I heard crashing into wood furniture. I don?t know how long I was blacked out; it might have been 10 minutes. I managed to get up onto the bed and felt something wet on my pillow case. It was blood coming from a deep laceration on my chin. My doctor told me to go to urgent care. They sent me to the emergency room. I was kept overnight for observation and give three stitches in my chin. I have felt woozy ever since, but all the tests administered in the hospital showed no damage.

It could also be 012620A Received the vaccine and that night around 10 PM I started having chills and my body started shaking for about  1 1/2 hours.  The next morning, I had a dry mouth and vomiting with mucous  going down the back of my throat, low grade fever of 99.6F  loss of appetite and diarrhea which lasted about 17 hours.  My arm hurt and later it started itching.  A  rash formed around the injection site.  I went to Urgent Care.  They said I got an infection from the needle and gave me an antibiotic and told me to use a heating pad to stop the itch.  i got a blister on my arm which my son used a needle to puncture it and water came out.  Nothing helped so I went to my primary doctor,  Dr.  He said I was highly allergic to the vaccine and gave me a script for Prednisone  which I took for 7 days (start high with pills and then reduce amount     I think 3 of 10 mg )  he advised me not to take the second shot for the vaccine so I cancelled the appointment as the doctor said it would make me sicker.

                                                @ 2:32  (10/12/35) Patient presented to the front desk with concerns about covid-19 vaccine side effects.  She received her first dose on 2/18 and did fine till 2/20 when she started having a red itchy rash that lasted two weeks.  I explained to her that that was one of many normal reactions to the vaccine.  I emailed her an article about it.  She then said she had nausea for two weeks and still has some but less intense.  She is seeing her PCP.  I found a CDC report stating nausea can be one of the side effects.  She stated understanding.  She will be going out-of-town and will not be able to get her second covid-19 vaccine until 4/13. CDC article I referred to re: nausea: Local Reactions, Systemic Reactions, Adverse Events, and Serious Adverse Events: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient was given V-Safe information at the time of her first vaccine.  She said she did not use it because she is not tech savvy. The two weeks of intense nausea and still have some nausea now, though less intense is why the VEARS report.

On the 4th day it seemed like I&#39;d been drained and dry, by the 4th week my skin seemed dry and I tried to drink water, my eyes seemed a little deeper set. I went to my PCP and he sent me to a dermatologist.  The dermatologist and he gave me something to bathe in, and I didn&#39;t see any difference.  The spots are not like a rash, but the discoloration seems to be under the skin, its not a rash on top of the skin but underneath.

Has tried putting ice on it, as my daughter recommended her to do 2 days ago in 15 minutes intervals 3 times a day. Slowly fading now since been placing ice on it.   Spoke to my doctor yesterday who recommended her to call VAERS and make a report and then call back and make an appointment to get checked out once I spoke with you (VAERS).

                                                After approximately 5 days began developing rash and swelling at injection site, so-called &#34;Covid Arm&#34;.  Swelling, some pain, and significant itching in a patch some 4 to 5 inches in extent.  Gave her some over-the-counter antihistamine (Claritin) and this helped to resolve the symptoms somewhat.  Redness had abated somewhat by the end of the day.  I am reluctant to give her too much of the antihistamine due to dizziness and increased lack of mental clarity (she suffers from Alzheimer&#39;s).  Being a military wife, she has had many vaccinations, but has never had a reaction like this before.

It has taken 8 days for these to start subsiding,  I still have a few sharp pains and some redness

It was itching really bad and there were small bumps and she was red from one shoulder to the other. I applied a itching cream and it only lasted a couple hours so we tried many different creams but nothing seem to stop the itch. The rash is from her shoulders to her neck line and from nick to waist line and it itches tremendously.  The NP stated it was Shingles and she was prescribed meds and took them for 10 days and it cleared up for a few days. today it&#39;s broken out again and its itching. She&#39;s scheduled to get the 2nd dose and don&#39;t know if she should get the next dose

The patient reports an expected decrease in symptoms until 2/22/21, when the injection site became itchy and swollen, and developed a slight rash. I advised the patient to take Tylenol for pain/fever (especially for her second dose on 2/24/21), to take Benadryl at nighttime for the rash, and to use some OTC topical lidocaine for the itching/discomfort as needed.

                                                Two days after her second Moderna vaccination (administered on 2/25/2021) she developed lesions on her neck.  We took her to an urgent care clinic on 3/2/2021 and they diagnosed her with a shingles outbreak more than likely as a result of her vaccination.  She did not have any reaction to her first Moderna vaccination four weeks earlier.  She was prescribed an anti-viral.  She is more comfortable now but her cognitive and physical abilities have declined significantly.  She is also having significant sleep issues which have also contributed to her cognitive and physical problems.

                                                The day after injection I noticed a small red spot at injection site (01/12/21). On 01/22/21 around 9:00 am, I noticed a red area about 2 x 5 inches in size on the arm of the injection site (left).  It is slightly warm to the touch.  I called my doctor&#39;s office on 01/22/21, and they recommened putting a warm compress on it.

                                                On Saturday while getting your night medicines from the shelf, and started feeling dizzy, tried to reach the shelf and said to herself that &#34;i can&#39;t do it, I just can&#39;t do it&#34;.  She staggered back and sat down on a towel hamper and apparently fell off of that onto the floor, lost kidney function.  Tried to get up and managed to get her phone out and called her husband (he&#39;s hard of hearing - was downstairs).  She said when he got there her head was towards the bathroom door and felt that he could not get in and could not get her up so she tried to get up.  She did not have any strength.  Finally she got up to get on her elbow and crawled into the vanity area and raised up and pulled herself up.  She did not enough strength to walk to the bed.   She got to the bed and then started with chills, turned on her electric blanket.  She felt better Sunday, 1/7/21, and is real shaky today.  She feels a little stronger but is not back to where she wants to be.  Yesterday evening she felt her arm itching a little bit, and looked at it and it was swollen and red, and had an area about the size of her hand.  Her husband felt of it and said that he felt she had fever in it.  The arm was sore to touch.  It is itching a little bit this morning.  She had a headache for a couple of days as well, took a Tylenol one night and her head felt real weird.  It was not real severe, and it hurt more times than it did others.  It would come and go.  Has not taken anything else for these symptoms.   Her husband checked her BP, Friday was 108/62, and last night 106/67.

About 5:00 PM her mouth started watering and she got the drive heaves, and then about 15 minutes and then started having them bad.  She laid down and after 15 minutes she could not breath, couldn&#39;t get any air.  When she was able to get some air, her throat was sore and she was really hoarse.  Later in the evening she laid down again and the breathing difficulty happened again and it was worse.  She was scared to the point that she was afraid to lie down.   She is fatigued.  She finally fell asleep during the night and didn&#39;t sleep much and today is very tired.  She called her doctor this morning, and talked to the nurse.   They told her if it got worse to go to the ER.  Told her to call the CDC.

This happened on Saturday after having the shot on Friday night.  Sunday a.m. my temp was 99 and I just felt lethargic.  However, I had a large red patch at the injection site - as I did following the first injection.  This has itched very much.  I had felt fine since Monday until today when I have had some stomach cramping.

                                                Two days after injection pain in upper back began.  When inspected there was a rash.  The rash has spread to cover most of her upper left side of her back, under the left arm and across the left side of her chest.  Patient says that it feels like it is spreading down her arm now.  She visited the doctor on 3/1/2021 thinking it was an allergic reaction.  The doctor diagnosed her with shingles.  Patient has never had shingles in the past.

                                                pt stated that about 2 days after getting the covid vax her upper left arm was sore and she developed a dry cough. She lost her voice since her throat was hoarse.  She had alot of mucus and nasal congestion.  On 1/29/2021 pt stated she was very very weak and could hardly function.  On 2/1/2021 she was worse and started running 101 temperature.  She contacted her PCP where he recommended for her not to take her 2nd covid vax dose but did not give her any medical advice.  She is still having periods of weakness at this time.

Other than a minor soreness in the arm, I had no adverse effects. On Friday, January 22nd, however, the area around the injection site became red and warm. At this time, two days later, the inflammation continues and the reddish &#34;patch&#34; is beginning to itch. Just thought that you would want a report of this delayed reaction.&#34; Per conversation with patient, on this date 1/25/21, pt reports that she is still experiencing small amount of itching as well as redness and slight sensitivity to the injection site.  Pt denies need for further medical care, and that she is fine but thought we should know.

She stated that the evening after the patient received the vaccine, she felt some mild injection site pain.  The morning after, the patient reported severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting.  The patients daughter then called her physician to report these symptoms and attributed them as an adverse reaction to the vaccine at that time.  These symptoms were intermittent for one week and no other adverse reactions were noted.  In the early morning hours of 1/27/2021, the patient was toileting and had expired while doing so.  An ambulance was called and cause of death was not found. An autopsy was not performed.

Was itchy, slightly warm and slightly puffy the first day, so we applied cortizone cream.  It got slightly larger over the next day or so and then has slowly faded...though has not gone away completely.  Even today it is still slightly pink.  It didn&#39;t itch after the first day.

                                                Left arm became red, warm, swollen within hours of injection. This continued to spread starting with a 2 inch circle and spreading down the arm to the elbow and encircling the arm.  Warmth, pain, swelling and redness increased. Also had profound weakness and lethargy that lasted three days.  No elevated temperature.    Contacted Dr. on 2/5/21 via email in MYCHART Main line health.  He advised cool compresses, hydrocortizone and Benadryl or Claritin.  We continued this regimen with no improvement  until 2/16/2021. At that time redness was faint on arm about 2 inches of deep red and painful circling arm near elbow.  On 2/18/2021 rash gone but skin peeling from shoulder to midarm.  No further pain or redness or warmth after 2/20/2021

                                                On Friday, February 18th, 2021, patient received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid administered by Pharm D at our pharmacy. The patient called the pharmacy on March 4th, 2021 to explain that her arm was red and itchy.  The pharmacist that day told the patient to use ice compresses and to come by the pharmacy to show us her reaction.   Today, March 5th, the patient came to the pharmacy with her son to show us her left deltoid. I observed her arm was red and hot to the touch. She has very defined edges of the rash on her arm. She did not have streaking on her arm, that I observed.  Patient said she had a small, red spot about 3 days after she received the shot, which started February 21st .  She was complaining of itching and has been watching the red spot get bigger every day. I instructed her to call you to have you look at her arm. She said it was just itching and she would like to try OTC products before going to the doctor.  I instructed her to take Benadryl 25mg up to four times per day.  Because Benadryl will make her tired, she can only take it when she is at home and not driving.  I also gave her Hydrocortisone 1% ointment to use at least twice per day on her arm.  I also reiterated that ice packs would help with the redness and discomfort.  She verbalized her understanding. I instructed her to call you to make an appointment if she is not improving. I also told her if she sees any signs of continued spreading or red streaks on her arm, she needs to seek immediate medical attention.

Itch at vaccination site happened at some point, at the time I ignored it and did not associate it with anything.  Vaccination site was pink. My daughter had drawn a circle with a pen around the pink vaccination site on Wednesday  6 January, to see if the pink area grew.  Yesterday 11 Jan when I went to shower I noticed it was still pink and somewhat itchy, and the pink area had extended beyond the circle about 1 mm.  Today 12 Jan it has not itched, but it is still pink and extends about 3 mm. It is not hot to the touch, it is not tender to the touch. It has finally begun to slowly fade, but it is still ongoing.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna vaccine IM left deltoid on January 23, 2021 and the next week developed redness, discomfort and swelling in the left arm. She had seen her dermatologist that week for another issue and the dermatologist was so concerned that she described Keflex. The patient was afraid to take the Reflex as she has a PCN allergy so she presented to  Urgent care. She has a cellulitis in the arm.  She has antihistamine a home and took one last night. I advised her to take it nighty until resolves and to start Clindamycin  po TID x 10 days to treat cellulitis and also may take Famotidine prescribed by her physician which she had not started yet and may use OTC cortisone cream on area.

Rash had not improved at time of call. Writer advised she be evaluated by her PCP for possible treatment of rash and to determine whether she should receive 2nd vaccine in series. Phone call to patient on 3/9/21 to check status. She reports she saw PCP who gave injection of steroid and a steroid taper. He recommends against receiving 2nd vaccine d/t high suspicion of adverse reaction to the vaccine. At time of call, patient is in NAD and notes some improvement in rash.

                                                This was the 2nd Moderna Shot on 2-18-2021.  She received the first shot on 1-22-2021. Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
