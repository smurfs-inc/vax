                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                18 year old female came to hospital for chest tightness, choking sensation in the throat as well as skin rash after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.  Initially patient presented to emergency room but subsequently discharged on steroid and Benadryl.  Patient had continued episode of choking as well as chest tightness and skin rash for that patient came back to emergency room.  Patient had received total 5 doses of epi pen because of that.  Patient was admitted to medical floor initially.  Patient was given steroid, Benadryl and famotidine.  Patient had 2 episodes on medical floor where she started feeling choking and chest tightness.  Patient remained stable hemodynamically except for tachycardia.  Patient was transferred to intensive care unit for close monitoring.  D-dimer was negative, urine tox screen was negative, COVID-19 PCR was negative, EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  CT scan of neck was negative.  We had discussed that patient has remained stable hemodynamically in the intensive care unit and discharge planning was discussed and patient was getting ready to be discharged when she had another episode where after drinking soda patient started having that choking sensation, patient remained stable hemodynamically during this episode as well.  Her symptoms had improved.  She looked visibly anxious.  Patient was monitored in the ICU for few more hours and patient remained stable.  I checked back on her and she was able to eat her lunch.  She probably had a allergic reaction to more than a vaccine but subsequent episodes are thought to be secondary to anxiety attack given situation.

                                                One week after the shot  (1-14-2021) Patient (19 y.o.)reported side pain and appeared constipated, Laxatives given along with Tylenol, on further assessment  Patient was noted to have left leg redness and abdominal fullness.   Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

                                                1 week after receiving the vaccination, a red welt appeared on my arm where the injection was given. It was hot, raised and itchy and about an inch and a half wide and long. I drew a line around it. The next day it was less itchy and hot but had gone about half an inch outside the initial lines. The third/ fourth day it was barely raised at all but had gotten even larger, now about 1.5-2inches outside the initial lines in some areas. It is now barely raised, barely red and has not gotten any larger since yesterday.

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

My arm has been red and itchy since the day, but it is increasing becoming warmed, bigger, and itchier every day since.

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

                                                On 1/5/21 Patient noted that the deltoid in which she received the vaccine was swollen, with bluish looking marks initially that transitioned to redness and a patchy, itchy, raised, red rash that spread down her arm, across her chest and abdomen. On 1/6/21, the rash worsened, resulting in patient going to the ER. Benadryl was prescribed and she was told to follow up with her primary MD.

Pt also reports that she experienced headache that started 3 hours post vaccination and lasted 3 full days (but she does suffer from chronic headaches).

                                                Pt reported that at about 7pm the day of her vaccine she developed a rash on her left arm/leg. It was itchy and so she took a Benadryl. She said her &#34;throat felt thicker&#34; but the Benadryl helped. She went to sleep and was fine. When she woke up the next morning on 1-6-2021 she reported the rash had spread. When she got to work and found me about 9:30 am to ask if that was normal I encouraged her to call her PCP and take a Benadryl. At that time she was having no difficulty breathing. She chose to call her PCP and not take a Benadryl as it makes her sleepy.  After she called her PCP she ended up leaving work. I found out later that her breathing had become labored and her neck/throat was starting to swell. Per her report, her PCP gave her epi and steroids, and R/X her an epi pen. She took her medicine and Benadryl around the clock and returned to work on 1-8-2021. When I spoke to her on that day she stated all of her symptoms had resolved, but her lymph nodes in her neck were still a little swollen.

                                                The first two days after injection it was painful to lift arm above 30 degrees and hurt upon palpation and I had an overall tiredness. A week after the injection on 1/13/2021 I developed a raised, red rash surrounding the injection site (2in x 4 in). The skin that was inflamed was 101.2 degrees fahrenheit.  The intense rash lasted around 24 hours and subsided after 3 treatments of Benadryl cream and one dose of oral Benadryl. The skin is still slightly raised and has a slight redness to it today (1/15/2021) but is much better than before.

                                                The patient started getting itchy on her face and neck 40 minutes after receiving the vaccination.  Soon after in the evening the patient had rash and hives on her upper torso and neck.  The hives spread the next day to eventually cover her entire body.  The pt. took a Benadryl and went to the hospital because of the severity of the hives and itching on day 2.   The staff told her that she should use hydrocortisone cream and should possibly not get the second dose of the vaccination.  The pt. continued to use both the Benadryl and hydrocortisone the following day, but still the hives persisted.   Pt. is on Day 4 and will let us know further details on her condition as time goes on.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine at 3:50pm on 01/25/2021. Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

On 12/28/2020 noticed the pain was back and I now have a medium sized lump in my armpit that was causing pain. On 12/31/2020 began to have a rash around the injection site that was increasing in size and limiting arm mobility. PCH EH sent CG to WorkMed and CG was given Rx for Keflex which was completed on 01/07/2021--CG stated symptoms are greatly improve.

                                                I received the Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/29. I had some minor swelling and soreness the first couple days after receiving the vaccine, but these symptoms both went away after a couple of days. A week later on 1/5, I noticed that the area where I had been injected was very swollen, red and itchy. It was localized to this year. There was some slight bruising around the top of where the swelling started. The area was not sore. There is still some redness and itching on 1/7 but the swelling has mostly gone down. I work in a community health center and had a PA I work with look at the reaction. I took some Benadryl as directed on 1/5 but have not treated the symptoms further.

A week later the site of the vaccination became hot and a welt began to form. A day later, the welt expanded and is continuing to expand and is currently 3 inches in diameter. She is experiencing fatigue additionally. *Please note that her menses have begun 2 weeks before it should.

Used HCT cream TID and took zyrtec 10 mg at work yesterday. The rash looks a lot better today. Not itchy anymore.  The area is tender but not as red as it was. No discharge/pus.  No numbness or tingling.  T97.6  Pt denies any other sxs except for SOB for about 30 min intervals over the first 2-3 days after the vaccine. Pt checked pulse ox when feeling short of breath and it was 96%. She states she&#39;s not sure if it was from anxiety.

                                                I developed a swollen supraclavicular lymph node above my left collarbone. It appeared just a few days after receiving the vaccine. No other side effects were noted aside from a sore arm and some itchiness around the injection site that lasted for 5 days after getting the vaccine. The lymph node is still swollen but is not worsening or painful. My sore arm and the itchiness have improved and are no longer an issue.

                                                I recieved the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/5/21 and did not experience any adverse reactions in the days following. Then, on 1/13/21 (8 days post vaccine) I noticed hives covering most of my body. My face was tingling and my lips were swollen. I took an antihistamine that evening hoping it would go away. The day after 1/14/21 I woke up with the hives all over my body, especially on my face. They were very severe and itchy. I went to my dermatologist and they recommended a steroid cream and oral antihistamine to help reduce the itching. It is now 1/15/20, and the hives are still covering most of my body with severe hives on my face.

                                                large, circular, red bump at the site of the injection. Noticed it  due to itchy sensation on 1/14/2021; however, this sensation has gone away, but the redness and lump still remains. No pain or other symptoms, but the rash area feels warm to the touch.

There was no redness and minimal swelling, and all symptoms had vanished completely after two days. However, one week after the injection date,  I experienced a renewal of discomfort at the site of injection, accompanied by swelling, redness, and itchiness. So far, these are my only symptoms. It has about 18 hours since these new symptoms appeared, and they seem to be improving slightly.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had gotten the these three red, circle marks on my left arm, below and diagonal from the injection site on Wednesday, 01/20/2021. On the 21st I noticed these three red circles grew to where they merged into one large spot. I drew a pen line around the spot to monitor the growth. Today, 22nd, I noticed it grew past the pen line. I have drawn another pen line around the new growth and will continue to supervise it. No itching, pain. A little heat from it.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

The patient also noted &#34;tingling&#34; in her right arm where she received the vaccine.  In addition, there was localized erythema at the injection site with about 5 cm in diameter.  I gave the patient 37 mg of Benadryl and the edema immediately was reduced in addition to the erythema resolved.  She had no more tingling.  I observed her for 30 minutes and all was fine with the patient.  I then checked on her 1 hour later and all was good.

                                                About 5:45 pm on Saturday, January 2, 2021 my inner left eye began to feel itchy and irritated like there was something in it. I touched my eye and rubbed it for approximately 30 minutes, but it still felt like I had something poking my inner eyelid. I looked in the mirror and saw my inner, upper, left eyelid was swollen and slowly getting worse. I tried applying a warm compress for 10 minutes, but it did not seem to help. I was getting ready for a shower and saw hives on my hips and inner thighs. I felt itchy in other places of my body as well. I saw hives on both of my upper arms, my back, and my neck. I took one 25 mg Benadryl and got in the shower. As I was showering, I felt my left upper lip begin to tingle and swell. I rushed to the ER immediately. I arrived around 7:25 pm. As I was waiting for the ER doctor, I noticed my lip and eye swelling were almost back to normal, but I still had hives and they were spreading. The ER doctor gave me Benedryl and Solumedrol in an IV around 9 pm. I left the ER around 10 pm. I had no more swelling on my eye and lip and my hives were slowly diminishing.

The itchiness and rash are new today, however a lump has been present since injection. The rash is directly above the lump. It may be unrelated, but I&#39;ve also been unusually drowsy (noticed before taking the benedryl).  I took benedryl and applied lotion to the rash. My pregnancy began July 4th and I was 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the vaccine. My estimated due date is March 25th, 2021. At the time of the adverse reaction, I am 29 weeks pregnant.

Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

Took 1 Aleve for the pain. Then on day 7 axillary pain went away and a rash started to form on arm where vaccine was given. Day 8 rash spread at was bright red. Around noon on day 8  hives popped up next to left eye. On day 8 did a virtual doctor appointment and the NP prescribed antibiotics because she said the &#34;rash&#34; is cellulitis.  At this time took zytec to help with the hives.

Left arm pain starting about 11 hours after shot. Difficult to move arm without intense pain and intense pain at the slightest touch of the arm on or around the vaccination spot. Starting the morning after the vaccination, my glands in my neck were tender and aching like they do when I?m fighting off a cold, I had body aches that you would get if you had a fever for the entire day all over my body. I took ibuprofen that night and they started to go away and I felt hot like I was breaking a fever. I woke up the next morning which is 2 days after the vaccination and felt completely back to normal besides residual arm pain. This pain is bearable and I can move my arm with only a dull pain and I can touch the spot without intense pain however it is still painful.

                                                On 1/4/2020 at roughly 07:00 PM, a dull ache started in my right arm where the vaccine was injected, it radiated from my right shoulder, to my right shoulder blade. My arm felt very heavy. There was also a small hard lump beginning to form with a little heat at the injection site. I had difficulty sleeping due to the aching pain. On 1/5/2020, I woke up at 06:30 AM, the lump had grown in size, and was much more red and hot to the touch, in an oval shape. By roughly 11:30 AM same day, it began to itch, I had checked it and the lump had raised significantly. Hot to the touch. The dull ache had begun radiating into my right armpit as well as down to my right elbow. By 06:00 PM, same day, the aching had continued,  the lump was still very raised, itchy, red, and hot. It looked like a large hive. By 06:30 AM on 1/6/2020, the dull ache had mostly subsided, my shoulder blade still felt uncomfortable. The itching continued. The redness spread in size, however the swelling of the lump had gone down slightly.

                                                Patient reported feeling like her tongue was tingling and felt larger than normal. She did not report having any difficulty breathing.  25mg of Benadryl was given orally.  After 10 minutes she thought she was feeling a bit better, but then continued to say that she was having tingling and not &#34;feeling normal&#34;.  We decided to administer epinephrine instead of waiting for her to continue to get worse.  I administered an epi-pen (0.3mg) about 30 minutes after she took the Benadryl and a nurse from the SNF called 911.  Paramedics arrived and evaluated her.  Her breathing sounded okay via the paramedic&#39;s stethoscope.  Because she was still not reporting feeling &#34;back to normal&#34; and because she had epinephrine administered, she was transported via ambulance to the ER for continued monitoring.

                                                Employee noticed bilateral hives on her lower legs on 01/05/2021. She took Benadryl and applied steroid cream with little resolution of her symptoms. She contacted her PCP who told her to seek evaluation at the urgent care. She went to the urgent care on 01/05/21 and was tested for COVID (negative) and was given an Rx for steroid cream. CG called me back on 01/07/21 stating that she now has developed a &#34;circular rash&#34; around her injection site, which her PCP was able to assess. The CG reports that her PCP told her she is ok to receive the second dose, but with close monitoring and to pre-medicate with Benadryl.

I had arm discomfort initially from the vaccine, but that when away.   I am on day 13 since injection. I feel normal other than the  red ring that continues to spread.  I have been taking photos and making the site.  The area inside the ring is warmer compared to my other deltoid on the right side. I am schedule for the next vaccine on the 1/26/21.  I just wanted to make sure I would still qualify to get the second dose/ safe? I can send pictures as well. I just wasn&#39;t able to attach an image.

                                                Around 9:00-9:30pm on Jan 16th (vaccination date of Jan 8th), I noticed my arm in the area of the injection site had swelled, turned red/pink, and felt itchy. Area is approximately 8mm in length and 4-6mm in height, irregular shape. Area feels tight, hard, and significantly warmer than remainder of arm. No fever, but site registers approximately 98F, which is above forehead temperature. Given my history of delayed reactions to insect bites, I felt reporting may be necessary. No medical treatment sought as of 10:05pm on Sat Jan 16th, but I will call primary care provider/urgent care center if symptoms worsen or if taking over the counter loratidine 10mg does not improve swelling, itching, and redness.

Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

I did not have a rash anywhere else on my body. It was below the skin, not raised or itchy. The rash faded after 1 day but there is still an outline there.

                                                Immediately following the vaccine there was nausea after eating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain which lasted about 8 days. 9 days after receiving the vaccine the injection site area got itchy, hot and swollen. Redness appeared about an hour after icing the area down. Benadryl was taken within 30 minutes of symptoms starting and swelling did go down moderately, but redness and heat from area remained. Today being day 10 after the vaccine, the redness, swelling, hot temperature and itching are still present. The area is about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide. Redness is in the shape of a ring with the center of the swelling area being white and the outer edges being red. None of the symptoms have worsened since day 9 and self care with Benadryl and icing is being continued.

The welt is very firm and slightly tender to the touch, blanches when pressure is applied, and occasionally itchy. My arm is also sore I am still experience extreme fatigue. No treatment or medications have been taken to alleviate these symptoms at the time of this report submission.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, I had redness around the injection site and a sore arm for about 2-3 days. I received the shot on a Tuesday, and by the weekend my arm felt fine. One week later (Monday 25th), I felt like I had a light fever. My temperature was 99.1F. Tuesday, my left arm where I received the injection was SO SUPER itchy. When I looked at it, there was a huge, red, swollen, bump. The area was about the size of a credit card. The area was also HOT to the touch even though the rest of my arm felt like a normal temperature. From Tuesday 26th through Wednesday 27th (time of reporting), I still have the big, red, hot bump at the injection site, and my fever fluctuates in between 99.1-100.4F. I contacted my doctor who believes it is most likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He has advised me to take benadryl and tylenol, and if I still have the fever tomorrow, he will test me for strep, flu, and COVID. I have not taken the benadryl and tylenol long enough to see if there is any sort of impact. I should also mention that I get tested weekly for COVID at work, and my test from Monday January 25 has come back as negative.

At about 30 minutes post injection, she stated she had small bumps on her bilateral arms. They were hard for me to discern but she also claimed the bumps were painful.  I asked about any labored breathing or chest tightening and she denied both. After about ~45-50, she still stated the same itchiness and pain. Visually there was no change in my opinion. Patient then conferred with  supervisors at her employment about her next steps. Her PCP was closed and she was deciding if she wanted to go to urgent care. That&#39;s the last interaction I had.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

                                                Starting 3 days ago (approximately 10 days after vaccine) I started having muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was given in similar to the soreness right after the vaccine was given.  A few hours after the soreness was noticed I noticed red-raised hives in the injection site. Over all symptoms (soreness to touch same as the soreness right after vaccine was given, itching, redness, raised hives, and warm to touch in the area of redness). The next day the symptoms remained about the same but area of raised-red-hives now seems to be a more defined 4-5 inch long red oval in the area the vaccine was given. 3rd day redness seemed lighter in color but still a pretty defined oval with warmness to touch the soreness was a little better by the 3rd day. I started taking Amoxicillin 500 mg that I had at home on the 3rd day. Today, 4th day, overall seems to be getting better still some soreness, still a red oval but is getting lighter, still soreness but defiantly better than it was. My doctor had me start Keflex 500 mg Q 6 hours for 7 days I started taking that today.

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                On the morning of 1/8/2021 (exactly 6 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine), I woke up with large hives concentrated mostly on my upper body (face, neck, chest, stomach). I tried taking various antihistamines (excluding Benadryl, which would later prove effective) to combat the hives, but they were largely ineffective. The hives shifted throughout the day, starting in my upper body and working their way down to my lower extremities. The next day, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I woke up with worse hives (now all over my body, mostly concentrated on my stomach, hips, and legs) and angioedema in my face. At this point, I went to the hospital and received a course of IV fluids/steroids/Benadryl/anti-nausea medication and all symptoms subsisted. Symptoms returned a few hours after discharge, where I continued an oral regimen of the aforementioned medications. The next day, 8 days after the initial dose, my symptoms were equally severe and coupled with gastrointestinal distress, feverishness (likely due to dehydration from the Benadryl) and nausea. This morning (1/11/2021), 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my hives have largely subsisted. In summation, starting 6 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced 3 full days and nights of severe hives and swelling.

                                                Almost 48 hours after the vaccine I woke up with hives flush to my skin along my R&amp;L arms, under my arms, on my left hand, insides of both thighs, and around my ankles. My skin felt hot but minimally itchy. The insides of my hands and burn when I wash them and they feel really sore. The bottoms of my feet also felt like they were burning when I took a shower. Nothing in my diet or hygiene products have changes. I took a half dose of Benadryl at 11am today and the hives are still there along with the pain in my hands when washing them. I coordinated with my PCP and they recommended self monitoring and Benadryl.

It got swollen the next day, was very warm and the swelling went down the day after, but the rash kept growing for the next 2 days until it was 3-4 inches in diameter. It has slowly been going away a week after the rash first started.

Hurt to raise above my shoulder. This went on till about 1/9/21. Then it went away nothing at my infection site then it came back which is what my concern is same as 1/7/21 itchy, swollen, red and bruised. Why I?m reporting is I?m wondering if I should take my 2nd dose or not from these reactions just at the injection site and only fatigue. This is Day 10. I also took pictures 1/8/21 and 1/15/21

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

                                                On day 7 after receiving the vaccine, I noticed a small itchy lump in the muscle about 2 inches below the injection site.  I tried to rub the lump out slightly.  Throughout the day and the next, the skin became red and itchy and spread to a circle that is about 3in by 3 in.  Last night, I took ibuprofen and Benadryl.  The redness decreased slightly in the morning but has come back over the past few hours.  It is still itchy.  There is no longer a lump.

Over the course of a few days it was getting worse, starting to mimic cellulitis. I went to the ER on the 8th day, was treated with a course Cephalexin. On the 10th day it continued to spread, I went back to the ER and was taken off antibiotics. It is now day 12 and the swelling has subsided, it is no longer hot to the touch. Some redness remains as well as itchiness. Topical creams (hydrocortisone) seem to relieve itch.

Upon inspection RN observed redness, swelling, and irritation where pt had been scratching the site.  Offered to give pt benadryl on site, but pt refused because it &#34;knocks her out&#34; for 13 hours.  Advised to take a non-drowsy antihistamine when able, use cold compress, and stop scratching the site.  Pt was asked if she was having any other issues at that time, which she denied.  Telephone call made to patient at 4:18pm to follow up.  Pt stated she started to have an itchy throat and throat swelling and went to the hospital.  There she was offered Benadryl but declined.  She was given a steroid injection because she was having &#34;difficulty breathing&#34;.  Pt states ER doctor recommended a non-drowsy OTC antihistamine, and was unable to tell her if the difficulty breathing was an allergic reaction or due to anxiety.  Recommended following up with 2nd dose in 4 weeks but to see her PCP before that time to discuss.  Pt does not have PCP, so I recommended that she establish care and have an appt prior to her 2nd dose

However, I noticed a burn like rash developed on only the arm where I received the vaccine. It would flare up from time to time and lasted about a week. Before reaching out to the clinic and providers, I was taking Benadryl nightly. I then used a steroid cream, which eventually helped resolve the issue. The rash was not like normal. It was not a red hive. It was a white cluster of hives that looked like blisters.

Patient also states her throat continues to feel tight, but denies any throat swelling. Chest tightness and palpitations have since improved, only with occasional flutters in her chest similar when feeling excited. Denies nausea, rash, itchy skin, or abdominal pain. No history of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions. Patient is prescribed Nexium, but denies taking any other daily medications.  Physical exam shows to be unremarkable with no rash or throat swelling/erythema. Patient does not appear in respiratory distress. Lung sounds are clear.   Will order an EKG. Will administer IV Epipen and IV Benadryl.   Differentials: Allergic Reaction   EKG shows NSR with sinus arrhythmia. Otherwise normal with a rate of 87 bpm.

I have pictures if anyone wants them.

It was also incredibly painful,  such as when my shirt was just resting on it, as shirts do. This lasted for 2 days and it still has some redness and sensitivity. The joints on my hands and wrist also became swollen and incredibly sore, and this has still not gone away.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

It is now 3:00pm 1/7/20 and the fever, chills, nausea, and body aches have subsided, however the fatigue and left arm pain still persists.

However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

After one dose of 650 mg acetaminophen my temperature went back down to 98.6 F. The next day 1/7/21 I did not have a fever; I still had mild chills and headache and pain at the site of injection. For the pain I took 1,000 mg of acetaminophen at morning and at night which eased the pain. The following day 1/8/20 I did not have headache or chills and had very mild pain which was tolerable.

                                                Initially, there was soreness, swelling, and redness (all around upper arm - a bit below deltoid) around injection site over the course of a few days. The area was warm to the touch compared to the rest of the arm. All symptoms went away after 5 days. Exactly 7 days later, a little bit of the soreness came back and there was a redness marking the size of a 50 cent coin. The next day, the soreness grew and the redness spread and the area became warm to the touch again. I talked to a doctor over video chat to talk about what I should do - I was advised to use an ice compress, which I did a few times on and off. The next day (today), redness spread, but soreness and feeling warm to the touch stayed the same. I went to urgent care and was given 7-day antibiotics and told to use Claritin/Zyrtec to lower my histamines. If anything progresses, I should let the provider know.

I saw my primary care provider on 1/7/2021 and she advised taking Benadryl and started me on Augmentin.

                                                Received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday 12/30/2020. Sunday 1/3/2021 started with some dizziness. On Tuesday 1/5/2021 developed hives on feet and ankles. Dizziness worsened and hives had spread to hands and wrists the following day. Upon arriving to work on Thursday 1/7/2021, hives had progressively gotten worse and I was tachycardic. Called employee health where I was instructedto go to the ED. Was tachycardic 100-130 bpm and hypertensive 156/112mmHg upon arrival to the ED. Received IV Benadryl and Decadron for the reaction/hives. Viotals were normal upon discharge. Continued with Prednisone and benadryl. Taking Meclizine to help with dizziness.

Soreness continued through 1/11 and worsened 1/11 at night. Woke up on 1/12 with red, itchy, raised rash which has since spread. Saw PCP 1/12 who determined it was cellulitis at the injection site, started on Keflex 4x daily for 10 days

I then began feeling lightheaded and dizzy about 2 hours after vaccination. Shortly after I became feverish with chills. I then took 2 Ibuprofen and fever/chills subsided, however lightheadedness continued but improved slightly.

I developed a low fever of 101.1F and had chills. By the  next morning your symptoms were relieved.  I did get diagnosed last Tuesday with Covid which was one week after the Moderna vaccine. A few days after I got diagnosed with Covid, the swelling returned at the injection site.   As of today I have no redness or swelling anymore at the injection site.

                                                Starting 01/16/2021, there was itchiness and a cluster of red papules/wheals that showed up on my right back. The rash continued to spread the next few days with increasing papules and itchiness. The rash is localized to my torso. Most are on my right abdomen and right back but is now spreading to my left side and upper back. There are also a few under and on my right breast and below both my armpit areas. The rash is still erythematous, with some that are papular and some appearing like vesicles. There is still itchiness and some stinging sensation. I am currently on Hydroxyzine 25MG at night and Zyrtec OTC during day but it has only been 2 days since I started the meds. The itch does wake me up at night time. So far the antihistamines have helped a bit with the itch. At the same time, I appear to have a sore throat though it feels more like a mild swelling of my throat as whenever I swallow it feels sore.

                                                I started to notice on Tuesday, January 19th, that there was a red bump on my arm. It looked more like a mosquito bite to me and was not bigger than a quarter. It didn?t feel itchy but I thought nothing of it. I noticed when I got home it was twice as big but I still felt no pain. It appeared that my arm was also swollen. The following day on Wednesday, it has grown in size again covering my arm, maybe the size of four quarters. Throughout the day it felt a bit hot, especially when I touched it. It did not feel itchy and I didn?t feel any pain. I felt a bit tired this day so I?m not sure if it was because of it. The redness has gone down today (Friday, January 22nd) however the mark is still big and in the shape of a square now. The outer part of the mark is more red and raised up, like it has a red border.

                                                Despite not having any abnormal reactions immediately following the vaccine (except for pain at site of injection, muscle aches, chills - which went away after 3 days), a week after the vaccine, I noticed that my left arm was hard around the injection, and a bit itchy. I massaged it a bit, and it started hurting - that night, I woke up from the pain, and had to take ibuprofen to sleep (probably 4/10). The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better. This went on all of Friday as well - I took some Benadryl, and that seemed to make it better (or it might have just made me sleepy enough that I didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not sure). I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness. Sunday, the redness in both areas continued to fade, but the bumps were noticeable and more itchy than before. The hardness seems to have resolved almost completely, although the area is still a bit sore when massaged.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

I put cold compresses on it that afternoon and took a Benadryl for a couple of days and it resolved on its own.

                                                7 days after receiving the vaccine, I developed a large, warm red blotch about 3-4in in diameter on my left deltoid. The following day, this blotch spread more than an inch down my arm and developed a prominent red ring around the border.  For a couple days, I took Zyrtec, thinking I may have been bitten by something, which had no effect. 10 days after getting the vaccine, I had an in-person appointment with my PCP who examined my arm and reported to me that this has been seen in patients who received the Moderna vaccine, usually appearing 5-7 days following vaccine administration. Today (11 days after the vaccine), the blotch continues to spread but appears less red and is clearing in the center where it originated. No fever, minimal swelling, hot/warm to the touch at times, no itching, border is slightly raised at times. I was told to monitor and call if I see red streaks traveling from the area indicating infections.

Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

I had severe chills, severe body aches, a mild fever, and extreme redness and swelling at the injection site. The side effects kept me out of work for one shift. The chills, body aches, and fever subsided within 36 hours, the severe redness and swelling at the injection site has continued to persist. I took Tylenol 1g q8hr for the side effects.

Itchy, red, hot to the touch. Tried benadryl- this did not work well enough so employee health NP prescribed Atarax. I took this for 3 days and the rash started to go down. Today (1/29) rash is still not completely gone, but getting better

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 21 Jan 2021, approximately two hours prior to the start of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 032L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Approximately two hours after receiving the vaccine at 12:30 pm, the patient experienced heavy feeling in her neck and face area that hurt really bad. Later, she noticed numbness in her hands and feet. Slurred speech was reported from a bystander. By 3:30pm, the patient was completely paralyzed on her right side. She was taken to the hospital, and a code stroke was initiated; however, all labs were normal.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient was still paralyzed on her right side, unable to walk, had shooting pain feeling, and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly. The doctors planned to discharge her on the next day to a rehab center because she could not function alone.  Treatment for the event included pain medication and hospitalization.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly, unable to walk and shooting pain feelings were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 25-year-old, female, patient, who experienced heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly and shooting pain feelings.

                                                I developed red, itchy blotches on the right side of my stomach approximately 1.5 weeks after my first Moderna dose. I did not take any medications to treat these symptoms and they have faded away for the most part. There is significantly less redness and no longer an urge to scratch.  I have not experienced any other serious adverse reactions. I was advised to see an allergist, however, my insurance requires that I see my PCP to get a prior auth/referral for an allergy specialist. The allergist that is contracted with the Super POD has a 50&#43; person waitlist and I will be going to my local urgent care to see a provider.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.
