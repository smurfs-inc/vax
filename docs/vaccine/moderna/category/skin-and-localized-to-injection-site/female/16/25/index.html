                                                Client came to be vaccinated accompanied by her father on Saturday January 23, 2021. The greeting table in the front was very busy and a lot going on. The client had registered online and had her paper to prove it when she was escorted to he next tables to be registered. There was nothing adverse about her registration form. Date of birth was listed, however, it was not caught that she was less than 18 to receive Moderna. We advertise that it is the Moderna vaccine that we have. Father never said anything and stood off to the side waiting for her to be observed for 15 minutes. On Monday, January 25, I spoke with client who answered phone, to explain what happened and to see if she was OK. States her arm at injection site hurt a little, but nothing else. I said I would call each day to make sure she was OK. Later in the day, she left a message to call her. I called and she wanted to know what vaccine she would get as her second dose. I said it would not be Moderna and that I could find some information and call her back. Then she states she has a lawyer and to whom should she address it to. I said the Health Officer at the city.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

The next day more hives appeared on knees and the ones on feet got worse.  The day after that hives also appeared on hips and elbows.  On 1/27 went to Doctor&#39;s office and received steroid shot to stop the allergic reaction. Took 5-7 days for all the hives to disappear. Based on the allergic reaction to the first dose, doctor recommended not taking the second dose as reaction could be more severe and/or have an asthma attack.

                                                For my first dose, I had quite mild symptoms. I woke up with a migraine the next morning and some soreness at the injection site. Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

                                                18 year old female came to hospital for chest tightness, choking sensation in the throat as well as skin rash after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.  Initially patient presented to emergency room but subsequently discharged on steroid and Benadryl.  Patient had continued episode of choking as well as chest tightness and skin rash for that patient came back to emergency room.  Patient had received total 5 doses of epi pen because of that.  Patient was admitted to medical floor initially.  Patient was given steroid, Benadryl and famotidine.  Patient had 2 episodes on medical floor where she started feeling choking and chest tightness.  Patient remained stable hemodynamically except for tachycardia.  Patient was transferred to intensive care unit for close monitoring.  D-dimer was negative, urine tox screen was negative, COVID-19 PCR was negative, EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  CT scan of neck was negative.  We had discussed that patient has remained stable hemodynamically in the intensive care unit and discharge planning was discussed and patient was getting ready to be discharged when she had another episode where after drinking soda patient started having that choking sensation, patient remained stable hemodynamically during this episode as well.  Her symptoms had improved.  She looked visibly anxious.  Patient was monitored in the ICU for few more hours and patient remained stable.  I checked back on her and she was able to eat her lunch.  She probably had a allergic reaction to more than a vaccine but subsequent episodes are thought to be secondary to anxiety attack given situation.

One week from the date of my vaccine, I woke up with a swollen and red arm below the injection site. It was itchy and painful. This has persisted for two days and I saw a physician for it. We are currently monitoring the site for possible cellulitis.

Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

It is warm and  painful; however, the patient says it is not getting more painful.  The actually injection point as a raised, smooth, moderately dark pink wheal about  4 X 4 mm.  No drainage at site.  The Wheal reminds me of an old smallpox  vaccine scar.

She cam back in side the room and we had a nurse assess her, her BP and heart rate were a  little elevated. We gave her some water and had her sit for some extra time while we talked to her. She has a child hood trauma regarding vaccine and had just had a major panic attack before and during her vaccination. We were all  pretty sure she had just worked her self up and was not feeling well because of that and she said as much herself. After about 15-20 more minutes her BP and heart rate were back to normal and although still feeling a little weak she was ready to go home with her mother.

It comes and goes but will flare up and become itchy at random times. There is small swelling in the itchy area but not a huge bump on arm, only slight risen and very red, work/ hot feeling in the area. Currently feeling this now 1/22/21 as I fill this form out but it is going away, again.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I had pain at the injection site and swelling that has persisted more than 48 hours later. I experienced chills 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. Then around 8pm on 2/3/2021, I started feeling very nauseous and had a fever of 100.1 F. Now on 2/4/2021, I don&#39;t have a fever anymore and I feel fine, but I still have pain and swelling at the injection site.

                                                My entire face was covered with hives. Within 2 hours of the vaccine I developed hives to the bilateral aspect of my face, forehead, cheeks and eyelids. My hives were itchy and red and I have never experienced this before. I did not consume any new food or use any new products. I took Benadryl for the itchiness. I had a telemedicine visit and I also had a Covid-19 test which was negative. I called health and also reported this adverse reaction. Moreover, I had no reaction to my second dose which was on 01-28-2021.

                                                I developed a very large, swollen lymph node under my left axillary.  I have never before had a swollen lymph node in either axillary regions of my arm. It was very painful, I could barely put my arm down because of the pressure of it pressing against the side of my body at rest. It has gotten better, there isn?t as much pain but it is still uncomfortable. The lymph node was/is palpable, and hurt upon touch and rest. The pain was an 7/10, but has now gone down to a 2/10. My arm is also still sore from the injection site, but it is not bad.

I started to sweat but had no fever at the time. This continued all night. I had no appetite after receiving my vaccine. Around 6:30 I started to get a fever of 100.3 and continued chills with headaches. I took Tylenol when needed. My whole body was sore throughout the day and got worse are the night progressed. My fever was in and out but around 9pm I had the highest temp of 101.4. I didn&#39;t get good sleep due to feeling unwell all night. I belive I stared feeling more myself sometime around 9:34am. But was still feeling a bit warm. But felt way better as the day progressed. My left arm where I received my shot is still very sore. And I still don&#39;t have an appetite.

It was hot, raised and itchy and about an inch and a half wide and long. I drew a line around it. The next day it was less itchy and hot but had gone about half an inch outside the initial lines. The third/ fourth day it was barely raised at all but had gotten even larger, now about 1.5-2inches outside the initial lines in some areas. It is now barely raised, barely red and has not gotten any larger since yesterday.

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

On 1/6/21, the rash worsened, resulting in patient going to the ER. Benadryl was prescribed and she was told to follow up with her primary MD.

                                                Pt reported that at about 7pm the day of her vaccine she developed a rash on her left arm/leg. It was itchy and so she took a Benadryl. She said her &#34;throat felt thicker&#34; but the Benadryl helped. She went to sleep and was fine. When she woke up the next morning on 1-6-2021 she reported the rash had spread. When she got to work and found me about 9:30 am to ask if that was normal I encouraged her to call her PCP and take a Benadryl. At that time she was having no difficulty breathing. She chose to call her PCP and not take a Benadryl as it makes her sleepy.  After she called her PCP she ended up leaving work. I found out later that her breathing had become labored and her neck/throat was starting to swell. Per her report, her PCP gave her epi and steroids, and R/X her an epi pen. She took her medicine and Benadryl around the clock and returned to work on 1-8-2021. When I spoke to her on that day she stated all of her symptoms had resolved, but her lymph nodes in her neck were still a little swollen.

                                                The first two days after injection it was painful to lift arm above 30 degrees and hurt upon palpation and I had an overall tiredness. A week after the injection on 1/13/2021 I developed a raised, red rash surrounding the injection site (2in x 4 in). The skin that was inflamed was 101.2 degrees fahrenheit.  The intense rash lasted around 24 hours and subsided after 3 treatments of Benadryl cream and one dose of oral Benadryl. The skin is still slightly raised and has a slight redness to it today (1/15/2021) but is much better than before.

Soon after in the evening the patient had rash and hives on her upper torso and neck.  The hives spread the next day to eventually cover her entire body.  The pt. took a Benadryl and went to the hospital because of the severity of the hives and itching on day 2.   The staff told her that she should use hydrocortisone cream and should possibly not get the second dose of the vaccination.  The pt. continued to use both the Benadryl and hydrocortisone the following day, but still the hives persisted.   Pt. is on Day 4 and will let us know further details on her condition as time goes on.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine at 3:50pm on 01/25/2021. Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

The injection site was swollen and red in addition to general muscle pain from the shot.  This continued until about 48 hours after the vaccination.

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

                                                Probably about ten seconds after receiving my second dose of the vaccine I stood up and walked out of the room and all of a sudden I felt my face get very hot and go numb and tingly and then my I started having trouble breathing. I went back into the room and still couldn&#39;t breathe so they sat me down and told me my whole body was bright red and they stuck me with an epipen. The whole reaction probably lasted a  little less than a minute from the time it happened to when they stuck me with the epipen.

She also stated that it felt like her tongue was too big for her mouth. She also stated that it looked like there was a mosquito bite at the site of administration. She took a benadryl (unknown strength) about 1 hour after developing the breathing symptoms, and an hour later, she was starting to feel better. As of 24 hours after, the administration site reaction is not resolved.

This was NOT wittnessed; she does NOT recall passing out or hitting her head. A co-worker noticed something wasn&#39;t right &amp; had her sit down. They called my wife who picked her up &amp; brought home &amp; rested. Approximately 5.5 hours later, after feeling &#34;better,&#34; she got up to get something to eat. While returning to bed (to rest &amp; eat the small container of applesause) she felt as though she were going to pass out again &amp; quickly sat down on the steps. However, she did not call for me (I was in the room nextdoor) for a few minutes... seemingly having &#34;zoned out&#34; but she does not think she lost consciousness.

                                                On Day 7, I noticed a large swollen lump where the vaccine was injected. It was red, itchy, and hot. Most of the swelling went down after 24 hours, but 4 days later I still have a very large rash that extends from my shoulder to my elbow. It is red and has clear borders. It is still itchy and slightly warm.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

The next morning 12/29/2020 I woke up with a migraine and still had severe pain in my arm. That night (12/29/2020) I began feeling aches and pains throughout my body and felt that into the next morning (12/30/2020). The evening of 12/30/2020 I noticed a dollar coin sized red spot on my arm that was warm to the touch and was slightly raised. (By this time my arm pain had decreased but was still present.) The red spot had grown slightly by 12/31/2020 but not much. Friday 01/01/2021 I hadn&#39;t payed much attention to the spot but it looked the same. The morning of 01/02/2021 I woke up and had noticed that the spot had taken over a large portion of the outer bicep on my right arm.

On 12/28/2020 noticed the pain was back and I now have a medium sized lump in my armpit that was causing pain. On 12/31/2020 began to have a rash around the injection site that was increasing in size and limiting arm mobility. PCH EH sent CG to WorkMed and CG was given Rx for Keflex which was completed on 01/07/2021--CG stated symptoms are greatly improve.

                                                I received the Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/29. I had some minor swelling and soreness the first couple days after receiving the vaccine, but these symptoms both went away after a couple of days. A week later on 1/5, I noticed that the area where I had been injected was very swollen, red and itchy. It was localized to this year. There was some slight bruising around the top of where the swelling started. The area was not sore. There is still some redness and itching on 1/7 but the swelling has mostly gone down. I work in a community health center and had a PA I work with look at the reaction. I took some Benadryl as directed on 1/5 but have not treated the symptoms further.

Used HCT cream TID and took zyrtec 10 mg at work yesterday. The rash looks a lot better today. Not itchy anymore.  The area is tender but not as red as it was. No discharge/pus.  No numbness or tingling.  T97.6  Pt denies any other sxs except for SOB for about 30 min intervals over the first 2-3 days after the vaccine. Pt checked pulse ox when feeling short of breath and it was 96%. She states she&#39;s not sure if it was from anxiety.

                                                I developed a swollen supraclavicular lymph node above my left collarbone. It appeared just a few days after receiving the vaccine. No other side effects were noted aside from a sore arm and some itchiness around the injection site that lasted for 5 days after getting the vaccine. The lymph node is still swollen but is not worsening or painful. My sore arm and the itchiness have improved and are no longer an issue.

                                                I recieved the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/5/21 and did not experience any adverse reactions in the days following. Then, on 1/13/21 (8 days post vaccine) I noticed hives covering most of my body. My face was tingling and my lips were swollen. I took an antihistamine that evening hoping it would go away. The day after 1/14/21 I woke up with the hives all over my body, especially on my face. They were very severe and itchy. I went to my dermatologist and they recommended a steroid cream and oral antihistamine to help reduce the itching. It is now 1/15/20, and the hives are still covering most of my body with severe hives on my face.

                                                For two days after my vaccine, I experienced only the normal discomfort at the site of injection. There was no redness and minimal swelling, and all symptoms had vanished completely after two days. However, one week after the injection date,  I experienced a renewal of discomfort at the site of injection, accompanied by swelling, redness, and itchiness. So far, these are my only symptoms. It has about 18 hours since these new symptoms appeared, and they seem to be improving slightly.

Those symptoms subsidized after 2 days. A week after the vaccine (1/19/2021), a lump appeared on my shoulder where the injection was done. The area is red, itchy and warm. Those symptoms have been observed for 2 days now.

                                                8 days after I received the moderna  vaccine, I noted a red, indurated rash/hive at the vaccine site. I was told by a provider that this delayed reaction was noted in some of the Moderna vaccine trials and given that I had no other symptoms (no fever, no warmth or signs of cellulitis) it would most likely go away in 3-5 days.  The next morning I woke up and my body was covered in hives. It is manageable with Benadryl. My roommate also had the exact same reaction, same timing, symptoms, etc and we both got the Moderna vaccine, same location, same lot, same time. Neither of us have allergies, and the other apartment mate has no symptoms (and has not received the vaccine).

She reported the itching resolved after the medications and then she is still complaining of breast pain.  She noticed 2 drops of fluid out of her right nipple.  I do not necessarily know that this is an allergic reaction I am just not sure what to make of the coincidence with the Covid immunization it could be entirely unrelated.  Advised follow-up with her PCP regarding these issues.  Return precautions discussed.  She verbalized agreement and understanding with plan of care.  Sent home from ED.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had gotten the these three red, circle marks on my left arm, below and diagonal from the injection site on Wednesday, 01/20/2021. On the 21st I noticed these three red circles grew to where they merged into one large spot. I drew a pen line around the spot to monitor the growth. Today, 22nd, I noticed it grew past the pen line. I have drawn another pen line around the new growth and will continue to supervise it. No itching, pain. A little heat from it.

A dull headache and difficulty to swallow continued. I also had tightness in my chest and shortness of breathe off and on.

It speads about 3-4 inchces across my arm. Hot to the touch and it has now formed a red ring my skin is raised from the swelling. I feel like a giant solid mass in my arm where I received the vaccine. I feel okay. I don&#39;t know if I have a fever.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

The rash was not raised and did not itch, but there was a mild tingling sensation to it.  40 hours post vaccine the rash  included my neck, stomach, upper back, and chest.   The rash was not raised and did not itch, but there was a mild tingling sensation to it.  The rash seemed to be the most intense between 40 to 44 hours post vaccine.  Following 44 hours post vaccine the rash began to gradually lighten and the tingling disappeared.  At 52 hours post vaccine the rash was barely noticeable in color with no tingling.

                                                Inflamed supraclavian lymph node and local site injection inflammation. Stated lymph node became inflammed the day after injection, which subsequently was misinterpreted by a physician as a potential aneurysm (pulsating mass), resulting in unnecessary hopsitalization. With reference to the site injection, left deltoid became red, itchy, and hot initally  surrounding local site only. However, as days progressed, reddening spread radially to extend to a final diameter of approxiamtely 5 inches, which also required medical intervention. I was presecribed steroids and anitbiotics which alleviated said symptoms. The symtpoms went away 3 weeks after first dose injection. Physicians advised against taking second dose.

                                                On the first day i felt my nerves shoot up into my neck. Got stiff neck and back 3 days after the vaccine. The stiffness turned into nerve problems and I felt hot and tingly on my neck, back and head for several days. 8 days later from the vaccination day i got a huge rash on my left arm. On top of that my armpit area was severely sore . Soreness and pain from the arm continued 2 weeks later.

                                                Severe injection site pain (aching) approximately 3 hours after injection on 2/2. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 2200 to take the edge off of the pain in order to fall asleep. Beginning at 0600 on 2/3: Temp of 100 F, chills, body aches, headache. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 1000 which lowered temp and reduced other symptoms for approximately two hours. Symptoms returned at 1200 with temp reaching 100.2 F along with chills, headache, and body aches that were more intense in the shoulder/neck area. Used a heating pad along my back, shoulders, and neck which helped with the body aches. Slept from 1500 to 1800 and woke up with an intense frontal headache with pain shooting through my eyes as well. Temp was 100.7 F. Took 400 mg ibuprofen which made the symptoms more bearable. Tried to stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Also had two servings of soup. Symptoms seemed to lessen by 2200. The only symptoms lingering today, 2/4, are a slight headache, fatigue, and mental fog. Otherwise, condition has improved tremendously.

However, 10 days later, I started experiencing mild sore throat and fever, headaches, and moderate aches and muscle weakness. Day 11 after the vaccine, I noticed a red, asymptomatic ring around the injection site. I have never had a reaction to any vaccine or shot before. In total, I experienced fever, sore throat, muscle weakness, fatigue for 4 days after the symptoms started.

Some mild nausea/loss of appetite. From the beginning of my symptoms to the end of them, my best estimate is about 36 hours. Taking an aspirin alleviated most of the symptoms to where I was more functional. I did call into work and skip a meeting the day after.

                                                Patient began to feel what she describes as &#34;tightness and pressure&#34; on bilateral sides of neck near lymph nodes. Pt became flushed red in the face and face became warm. A minute thereafter breathing became difficulty and she began to feel some abdominal pain. After deep inhalation and exhalation, pt was administered a Benadryl 25mg and 8 ounces of water patient&#39;s color began to return and her breathing improved and her abdominal pain resolved. Patient was monitored for 30 minutes and assessed before departure.

                                                The reaction is due to the SECOND dose in the series. I had a fever of 102.5 along with body aches, chills, etc, the day following the vaccine (2/9), but that resolved within 24 hours. The second day after was fine (2/10). The third day after I developed a deep red rash like pattern extending down my arm more than halfway down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was extremely high, just below the top of my shoulder and immediately below the body part of my shoulder, so the extent of the redness is ~6inches long.  It is extremely painful, warm to the touch, and slightly swollen. I went to the urgent care where I was diagnosed with cellulitis. I was prescribed doxycycline 100mg PO BID x5days. I am reporting this on the day of the reaction, and it is unknown how it will respond to the antibiotics or if it will get any worse.

He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

I immediately fainted and I lost consciousness for 5 minutes, while unconscious I also was incontinent and peed myself. When I came to, I was disoriented for about 2 minutes and very cold.  -For a week after I fainted I was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up without feeling that I was going to faint.  -The second week after my shot I also felt pressure on my chest for 5 days that has since then gone away.  -Since I fainted 3 hours after my shot  I have experienced constant ringing in both ears that have not stopped for the past 30 days since I got the vaccine. I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

The patient also noted &#34;tingling&#34; in her right arm where she received the vaccine.  In addition, there was localized erythema at the injection site with about 5 cm in diameter.  I gave the patient 37 mg of Benadryl and the edema immediately was reduced in addition to the erythema resolved.  She had no more tingling.  I observed her for 30 minutes and all was fine with the patient.  I then checked on her 1 hour later and all was good.

                                                About 5:45 pm on Saturday, January 2, 2021 my inner left eye began to feel itchy and irritated like there was something in it. I touched my eye and rubbed it for approximately 30 minutes, but it still felt like I had something poking my inner eyelid. I looked in the mirror and saw my inner, upper, left eyelid was swollen and slowly getting worse. I tried applying a warm compress for 10 minutes, but it did not seem to help. I was getting ready for a shower and saw hives on my hips and inner thighs. I felt itchy in other places of my body as well. I saw hives on both of my upper arms, my back, and my neck. I took one 25 mg Benadryl and got in the shower. As I was showering, I felt my left upper lip begin to tingle and swell. I rushed to the ER immediately. I arrived around 7:25 pm. As I was waiting for the ER doctor, I noticed my lip and eye swelling were almost back to normal, but I still had hives and they were spreading. The ER doctor gave me Benedryl and Solumedrol in an IV around 9 pm. I left the ER around 10 pm. I had no more swelling on my eye and lip and my hives were slowly diminishing.

The itchiness and rash are new today, however a lump has been present since injection. The rash is directly above the lump. It may be unrelated, but I&#39;ve also been unusually drowsy (noticed before taking the benedryl).  I took benedryl and applied lotion to the rash. My pregnancy began July 4th and I was 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the vaccine. My estimated due date is March 25th, 2021. At the time of the adverse reaction, I am 29 weeks pregnant.

                                                Fast Heart rate after an hour and half of injection and shortness of breath . Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

The following day, the lump was still there, it was red and hot, but not painful. The redness had spread towards my chest but did not go past my armpit. The size of the lump has decreased since then, nearly gone today on 01/07/2021.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

I had severe night sweats that night, but no fever.  Now it is day 3 post vaccine and I have a severe headache causing dizziness and nausea.

                                                Axillary pain started on day 4 (1/4) after vaccine and continued until day 7 which was so bad I could not sleep or move that arm. Took 1 Aleve for the pain. Then on day 7 axillary pain went away and a rash started to form on arm where vaccine was given. Day 8 rash spread at was bright red. Around noon on day 8  hives popped up next to left eye. On day 8 did a virtual doctor appointment and the NP prescribed antibiotics because she said the &#34;rash&#34; is cellulitis.  At this time took zytec to help with the hives.

                                                I had head pressure that felt like a headache In my temples and the back of my skull around 9-10 hours after the vaccine. Left arm pain starting about 11 hours after shot. Difficult to move arm without intense pain and intense pain at the slightest touch of the arm on or around the vaccination spot. Starting the morning after the vaccination, my glands in my neck were tender and aching like they do when I?m fighting off a cold, I had body aches that you would get if you had a fever for the entire day all over my body. I took ibuprofen that night and they started to go away and I felt hot like I was breaking a fever. I woke up the next morning which is 2 days after the vaccination and felt completely back to normal besides residual arm pain. This pain is bearable and I can move my arm with only a dull pain and I can touch the spot without intense pain however it is still painful.

                                                On 1/4/2020 at roughly 07:00 PM, a dull ache started in my right arm where the vaccine was injected, it radiated from my right shoulder, to my right shoulder blade. My arm felt very heavy. There was also a small hard lump beginning to form with a little heat at the injection site. I had difficulty sleeping due to the aching pain. On 1/5/2020, I woke up at 06:30 AM, the lump had grown in size, and was much more red and hot to the touch, in an oval shape. By roughly 11:30 AM same day, it began to itch, I had checked it and the lump had raised significantly. Hot to the touch. The dull ache had begun radiating into my right armpit as well as down to my right elbow. By 06:00 PM, same day, the aching had continued,  the lump was still very raised, itchy, red, and hot. It looked like a large hive. By 06:30 AM on 1/6/2020, the dull ache had mostly subsided, my shoulder blade still felt uncomfortable. The itching continued. The redness spread in size, however the swelling of the lump had gone down slightly. By 06:30 AM on 1/7/2020, the lump had mostly gone down in size significantly, the dull ache had subsided completely, the redness had gone away. By 1/8/2020, 10:00 PM, the lump and swelling are gone, no ache, no itch, still a slight discoloration where lump was.

                                                Employee noticed bilateral hives on her lower legs on 01/05/2021. She took Benadryl and applied steroid cream with little resolution of her symptoms. She contacted her PCP who told her to seek evaluation at the urgent care. She went to the urgent care on 01/05/21 and was tested for COVID (negative) and was given an Rx for steroid cream. CG called me back on 01/07/21 stating that she now has developed a &#34;circular rash&#34; around her injection site, which her PCP was able to assess. The CG reports that her PCP told her she is ok to receive the second dose, but with close monitoring and to pre-medicate with Benadryl.

I had arm discomfort initially from the vaccine, but that when away.   I am on day 13 since injection. I feel normal other than the  red ring that continues to spread.  I have been taking photos and making the site.  The area inside the ring is warmer compared to my other deltoid on the right side. I am schedule for the next vaccine on the 1/26/21.  I just wanted to make sure I would still qualify to get the second dose/ safe? I can send pictures as well. I just wasn&#39;t able to attach an image.

Area is approximately 8mm in length and 4-6mm in height, irregular shape. Area feels tight, hard, and significantly warmer than remainder of arm. No fever, but site registers approximately 98F, which is above forehead temperature. Given my history of delayed reactions to insect bites, I felt reporting may be necessary. No medical treatment sought as of 10:05pm on Sat Jan 16th, but I will call primary care provider/urgent care center if symptoms worsen or if taking over the counter loratidine 10mg does not improve swelling, itching, and redness.

                                                I received the dose at 1:45 pm on 1/13/2021 at Medical Center. Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

                                                Following the second phase around 5pm the intense feeling being extremely cold and despite being under 4 covers and a heated blanket I did not find relief. At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                Immediately following the vaccine there was nausea after eating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain which lasted about 8 days. 9 days after receiving the vaccine the injection site area got itchy, hot and swollen. Redness appeared about an hour after icing the area down. Benadryl was taken within 30 minutes of symptoms starting and swelling did go down moderately, but redness and heat from area remained. Today being day 10 after the vaccine, the redness, swelling, hot temperature and itching are still present. The area is about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide. Redness is in the shape of a ring with the center of the swelling area being white and the outer edges being red. None of the symptoms have worsened since day 9 and self care with Benadryl and icing is being continued.

The following day my fingers were sore. Three hours later red bumps erupted on my fingers and palms. Three days following the initial bumps, more bumps appeared on the bottom and tops of toes. Hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl provide minimal relief. The bumps continue to appear 16 days following  administration. The bumps are comparable to the bumps I experience when taking amoxicillin following Epstein Barr virus.

                                                Approximately a week after my first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, I developed a red welt at and around the site of injection on my left arm. The welt is very firm and slightly tender to the touch, blanches when pressure is applied, and occasionally itchy. My arm is also sore I am still experience extreme fatigue. No treatment or medications have been taken to alleviate these symptoms at the time of this report submission.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, I had redness around the injection site and a sore arm for about 2-3 days. I received the shot on a Tuesday, and by the weekend my arm felt fine. One week later (Monday 25th), I felt like I had a light fever. My temperature was 99.1F. Tuesday, my left arm where I received the injection was SO SUPER itchy. When I looked at it, there was a huge, red, swollen, bump. The area was about the size of a credit card. The area was also HOT to the touch even though the rest of my arm felt like a normal temperature. From Tuesday 26th through Wednesday 27th (time of reporting), I still have the big, red, hot bump at the injection site, and my fever fluctuates in between 99.1-100.4F. I contacted my doctor who believes it is most likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He has advised me to take benadryl and tylenol, and if I still have the fever tomorrow, he will test me for strep, flu, and COVID. I have not taken the benadryl and tylenol long enough to see if there is any sort of impact. I should also mention that I get tested weekly for COVID at work, and my test from Monday January 25 has come back as negative.

Approximately one week after the vaccine, I developed hives at injection site. Hives turned into another welt that continued to spread until I was given steroids to take. The steroids did cause the reaction to stop and go away.

At about 30 minutes post injection, she stated she had small bumps on her bilateral arms. They were hard for me to discern but she also claimed the bumps were painful.  I asked about any labored breathing or chest tightening and she denied both. After about ~45-50, she still stated the same itchiness and pain. Visually there was no change in my opinion. Patient then conferred with  supervisors at her employment about her next steps. Her PCP was closed and she was deciding if she wanted to go to urgent care. That&#39;s the last interaction I had.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

                                                Starting 3 days ago (approximately 10 days after vaccine) I started having muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was given in similar to the soreness right after the vaccine was given.  A few hours after the soreness was noticed I noticed red-raised hives in the injection site. Over all symptoms (soreness to touch same as the soreness right after vaccine was given, itching, redness, raised hives, and warm to touch in the area of redness). The next day the symptoms remained about the same but area of raised-red-hives now seems to be a more defined 4-5 inch long red oval in the area the vaccine was given. 3rd day redness seemed lighter in color but still a pretty defined oval with warmness to touch the soreness was a little better by the 3rd day. I started taking Amoxicillin 500 mg that I had at home on the 3rd day. Today, 4th day, overall seems to be getting better still some soreness, still a red oval but is getting lighter, still soreness but defiantly better than it was. My doctor had me start Keflex 500 mg Q 6 hours for 7 days I started taking that today.

As of Jan. 25th, the swelling/redness is gone. I did not seek treatment for this.

Nausea, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat, low-grade fever (~99°F) and persistent headache, and took Theraflu nighttime before bed on day two (02/03/2021). Temperature of 99.7°F throughout day three (02/04/2021); also, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat with swollen lymph nodes and tonsils with white spots (did at-home test for strep-A, got a negative result), and persistent headache?this night I also took Theraflu nighttime. Day 4 (02/05/2021), I woke up around 7AM  with severe nausea and went back to sleep after having ginger ale; throughout the early afternoon I had mild lower back and knee pain, same throat and tonsil situation, mild headache, and diarrhea. I ended up drinking a lot of water and had a glass of emergen-c as well as taking two pepto bismol tablets. Less than an hour later, I threw up everything I?d consumed throughout the day (water, hot tea, and emergen-c, no food due to nausea). Tried eating plain white rice and drinking  beer that evening but I couldn?t keep it down. Day 5 (today, 02/06/2022), I woke up with only lower back pain, same tonsil/throat situation, headache, and a slightly higher fever- 100.2°F. So far no nausea.

For unknown reason the patient arrived to vaccine clinic on 2/9/21 without allergy skin testing or follow up. She reportedly told them that she was &#34;&#34;cleared by Occ health&#34;&#34; after her first reaction and the administering RN said that there was no flag on her chart so she was given the vaccine.  Unfortunately, immediately after she got it, she developed throat tightening and got zyrtec. The reaction progressed very quickly (minutes) to diaphoresis, panic, grabbing at throat saying she was suffocating, nausea, and difficulty verbalizing. She was diffusely red but no hives. They couldn&#39;t get a BP and O2 sat and temp were normal but they put her on a non-rebreather and gave her Epi. Rapid response was called and she was taken to the ED.

About an hour after receiving vaccine,  she went through a drive thru to order food and &#39;wasn&#39;t thinking right, like I had brain fog&#39;.  That lasted a short time.  About an hour after receiving vaccine, patient noticed lips and mouth were tingling &#39;like I had ate something really spicy&#39;.  This lasted off an on for about an hour.  Later that evening, patient felt dizzy and nauseated.  She laid down and took a nap and woke up feeling better.  Skin started to feel itchy that night.

                                                On Saturday morning, I woke up with a red rash on the left side of my face. Throughout the day, the rash turned into itchy, blisters. I followed up with my primary care physician who diagnosed me with Shingles. Stating it could have been a correlation to the vaccine that compromised my immune system. I am on methyllpredinsone  and valacyclovir HCL.

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

There was alot of pain to site and some itching late the same day. Went to urgent care to have arm looked at since rash looked bigger on 12/30/20. PA took a look and diagnosed me with &#34;cellulitis of left upper limb&#34; and &#34;adverse effect of other viral vaccine, initial encounter&#34;. She prescribed Keflex 500mg and Cetirizine 10mg treating it as an infection. Redness went away on 1/3/21

The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                On the morning of 1/8/2021 (exactly 6 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine), I woke up with large hives concentrated mostly on my upper body (face, neck, chest, stomach). I tried taking various antihistamines (excluding Benadryl, which would later prove effective) to combat the hives, but they were largely ineffective. The hives shifted throughout the day, starting in my upper body and working their way down to my lower extremities. The next day, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I woke up with worse hives (now all over my body, mostly concentrated on my stomach, hips, and legs) and angioedema in my face. At this point, I went to the hospital and received a course of IV fluids/steroids/Benadryl/anti-nausea medication and all symptoms subsisted. Symptoms returned a few hours after discharge, where I continued an oral regimen of the aforementioned medications. The next day, 8 days after the initial dose, my symptoms were equally severe and coupled with gastrointestinal distress, feverishness (likely due to dehydration from the Benadryl) and nausea. This morning (1/11/2021), 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my hives have largely subsisted. In summation, starting 6 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced 3 full days and nights of severe hives and swelling.

The event occurred apparently few hours after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 026L2DA) administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

My skin felt hot but minimally itchy. The insides of my hands and burn when I wash them and they feel really sore. The bottoms of my feet also felt like they were burning when I took a shower. Nothing in my diet or hygiene products have changes. I took a half dose of Benadryl at 11am today and the hives are still there along with the pain in my hands when washing them. I coordinated with my PCP and they recommended self monitoring and Benadryl.

Hurt to raise above my shoulder. This went on till about 1/9/21. Then it went away nothing at my infection site then it came back which is what my concern is same as 1/7/21 itchy, swollen, red and bruised. Why I?m reporting is I?m wondering if I should take my 2nd dose or not from these reactions just at the injection site and only fatigue. This is Day 10. I also took pictures 1/8/21 and 1/15/21

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

The rash is warmer to the touch than the rest of my arm. It does NOT itch. This rash is different than the rash I had from the bandaids used at injection. That one lasted a week and was only the size of the bandaid.

                                                Vaccinated with shaken vaccine; Pain at the injection site; A spontaneous report was received from a pharmacist concerning a 24 year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced vaccinated with shaken vaccine and pain at the injection site.                           The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On an unknown date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.     On 04 Jan 2021, the reporter stated that the technician shook the vial while administering the vaccine on an unknown date.They also reported that symptoms included pain at the injection site.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The event, vaccinated with shaken vaccine was considered resolved. The outcome of the event, pain at the injection site, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 24 year-old female, who experienced a non-serious expected event of injection site pain and wrong technique in product usage process. The event occurred soon (exact time not provided) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # unknown. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, for the event of injection site pain a causal relationship cannot be excluded. There was no reported AE associated with this case of wrong technique in product usage process.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-002858: US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-002872: US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-002862:

I informed site administrator and patient was taken to the triage room when she stated she felt worst and was very pale.  FNP checked her pulse and respirations while Dr. was on the phone. Providers asked for her to be transferred to a room with a bed to lay down. Patient layed down her vituals were checked.  1:52pm BP-145/93 P- 66 T-97.7 R-18 2:03pm BP-117/77 P- 55 T-98.0 R-16 2:17pm BP-129/85 P- 59 T-97.8 R-16 Patient felt better after laying down for a few minutes and was send home to rest.

Acupuncture gave relief for 2 days so that I could lift it. Pain and ache returned. Ibuprofen and Tylenol do not lessen the pain at all.  Ache-type pain radiates down the arm and across the upper back. For the last 2 days, it hurts whether or not I?m moving it. The vaccine was given far too high in the arm.

                                                Exactly 7 days post vaccine, the injection site started to swell and turn very red and hot to the touch. Over the course of a few days it was getting worse, starting to mimic cellulitis. I went to the ER on the 8th day, was treated with a course Cephalexin. On the 10th day it continued to spread, I went back to the ER and was taken off antibiotics. It is now day 12 and the swelling has subsided, it is no longer hot to the touch. Some redness remains as well as itchiness. Topical creams (hydrocortisone) seem to relieve itch.

Upon inspection RN observed redness, swelling, and irritation where pt had been scratching the site.  Offered to give pt benadryl on site, but pt refused because it &#34;knocks her out&#34; for 13 hours.  Advised to take a non-drowsy antihistamine when able, use cold compress, and stop scratching the site.  Pt was asked if she was having any other issues at that time, which she denied.  Telephone call made to patient at 4:18pm to follow up.  Pt stated she started to have an itchy throat and throat swelling and went to the hospital.  There she was offered Benadryl but declined.  She was given a steroid injection because she was having &#34;difficulty breathing&#34;.  Pt states ER doctor recommended a non-drowsy OTC antihistamine, and was unable to tell her if the difficulty breathing was an allergic reaction or due to anxiety.  Recommended following up with 2nd dose in 4 weeks but to see her PCP before that time to discuss.  Pt does not have PCP, so I recommended that she establish care and have an appt prior to her 2nd dose

These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

                                                A few hours after the first dose (1/15), a welt grew around the injection site about the size of a silver dollar.  This went away after three days. Arm was sore for the first two days.  One week later (1/22), injection site became itchy, red and was very warm to the touch.  A welt formed as well. It started out the size of a silver dollar, and over the course of  48 hours the welt, itchiness, and redness grew to  the size of a large russet potato (Friday 1/22- Saturday1/23).  It was the most red around the injection site, with the most red being about the size of a silver dollar.  After 48 hours, it remained itchy, red, and had a welt  for the next 24 hours  (Sunday 1/24). The next morning (Monday 1/25) redness and swelling were gone but site was still a little itchy.  Site was only slightly tender throughout these three days but not painful. No other side effects were noticed i.e. fever, chills, chest pain.  Slight dizziness was felt if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything.

However, I noticed a burn like rash developed on only the arm where I received the vaccine. It would flare up from time to time and lasted about a week. Before reaching out to the clinic and providers, I was taking Benadryl nightly. I then used a steroid cream, which eventually helped resolve the issue. The rash was not like normal. It was not a red hive. It was a white cluster of hives that looked like blisters.

Sudden confusion, burning heat and hives and burning red rash spreading from injection site, up neck and throat and down arm to hand. 5 days after the injection, a severe allergic reaction occurred where my entire body broke into hives and a red burning rash, again starting at the injection site. Throat tightness, itchiness in scalp and groin, and difficulty concentrating (all my usual symptoms of anaphylaxis) occurred. Advised by health care provider to take Benadryl immediately and to have epi-pens on hand. Loratadine was prescribed.

Normally I stay up for a bit, but I felt achy and fatigued so I went to bed early. I woke up around 10am with a fever of 101.4 degrees, administered acetaminophen and went back to sleep. Woke up at 1pm and temp had dropped to 100.3, administered acetaminophen again and slept some more. My temp hovered around 100.3 until about 3pm on 01/29/21 when it dropped to 99.8. Around 6pm on 01/29/21 and about 48 hours after vaccination, my temp dropped to 98.9 and I went back to work. Along with fever I experienced headache, chills, skin sensitivity (likely due to the fever as that&#39;s a typical comorbidity for me), and body aches. I also had minor injection site side effects including redness and pain.

The bump on my arm however is growing in size and more painful.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                The first vaccine I only had mild arm pain which went away after a few days, exactly 7 days later I had a delayed localized reaction (extreme swelling size of a golf ball, redness, itching, hot to the touch). I spoke with my primary and he recommended to still get the second vaccine. The second vaccine the swelling came on almost immediately (about 2 hours after). It has now been two days since I have had the shot and my arm is now double the size of my muscle. (I am petite, 5?3 and 107 lbs) so my arms are tiny. My arm is red, hot to the touch, swollen and itchy. I have had a fever of 102.8, the lowest I have gotten it down is 101.2 with around the clock Tylenol. Other side effects: vomiting, chills, high fever, EXTREME joint pain. I?m concerned about the localized reaction (I would call it localized allergic reaction). I have photos I?m not sure if I can send them.

                                                One week from the vaccine there is a large red welt at the vaccine site. My arm is also very sore and itchy. It?s not serious enough to see a provider but I wanted to document any adverse reactions as the vaccine is still being rolled out.

The day after that, the bubble of skin turned yellow. This morning my injection site still has a bubble of skin that is now red and looks like it can pop at any time. It has not grown any bigger since the first time I saw it.

                                                A couple of days after the  first vaccine shot my ears began to itch uncontrollably. After 2 weeks, it progressed to my neck, but was manageable with over the counter lotion. After the second shot a month later, the itching progressed to my chest and arms. It?s become painfully itchy and I believe it to be eczema. However, I have never had this skin condition in the past. I have kept the skin clean and tried many treatments short of going to a doctor. Rubbing alcohol, witch hazel, eucerin cream, hydrocortisone cream, Benadryl anti itch cream, Benadryl, washing my bedding, and cutting my hair away from the affected areas provided no relief.  It?s been 2 months since the first symptoms and nothing has changed. In fact, it?s progressively gotten worse.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

                                                Exactly one week after the shot at the same time of the day I noticed that my arm was itchy. First I thought it was a bug bite. Within three hours it grew to the size of a golf ball. It grew bigger and I suspected cellulitis. They gave me antibiotics. I went to the ER and returned later because  I had been advised that if it had grown even bigger I should come back. It had been 2 days and they advised that it was vaccine related so I discontinued the antibiotics. It was a patchy looking rash that was itchy and painful. It seemed to to help if I took Ibuprofen or Tylenol. It took a full six days before it returned to normal size. I also got Diverticulitis about two weeks after the first shot. I went to the ER because I had severe abdominal pain and a low grade fever. I visited the ER and I was admitted to the hospital for three days.

The joints on my hands and wrist also became swollen and incredibly sore, and this has still not gone away.

Raised, warm to touch, itchy.  at time of reporting, approx 12 hrs later, there is minimal improvement. Took 1 benadryl at 2330 on 1/5. Mild discomfort and tingling throughout triceps on rt arm.  I did not experience any side effects other than injection site soreness for 72 hrs after receiving the vaccine.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

                                                I felt fine the rest of the day after I received the vaccine.  However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

After one dose of 650 mg acetaminophen my temperature went back down to 98.6 F. The next day 1/7/21 I did not have a fever; I still had mild chills and headache and pain at the site of injection. For the pain I took 1,000 mg of acetaminophen at morning and at night which eased the pain. The following day 1/8/20 I did not have headache or chills and had very mild pain which was tolerable.

                                                Initially, there was soreness, swelling, and redness (all around upper arm - a bit below deltoid) around injection site over the course of a few days. The area was warm to the touch compared to the rest of the arm. All symptoms went away after 5 days. Exactly 7 days later, a little bit of the soreness came back and there was a redness marking the size of a 50 cent coin. The next day, the soreness grew and the redness spread and the area became warm to the touch again. I talked to a doctor over video chat to talk about what I should do - I was advised to use an ice compress, which I did a few times on and off. The next day (today), redness spread, but soreness and feeling warm to the touch stayed the same. I went to urgent care and was given 7-day antibiotics and told to use Claritin/Zyrtec to lower my histamines. If anything progresses, I should let the provider know.

Upon arriving to work on Thursday 1/7/2021, hives had progressively gotten worse and I was tachycardic. Called employee health where I was instructedto go to the ED. Was tachycardic 100-130 bpm and hypertensive 156/112mmHg upon arrival to the ED. Received IV Benadryl and Decadron for the reaction/hives. Viotals were normal upon discharge. Continued with Prednisone and benadryl. Taking Meclizine to help with dizziness.

I developed a low fever of 101.1F and had chills. By the  next morning your symptoms were relieved.  I did get diagnosed last Tuesday with Covid which was one week after the Moderna vaccine. A few days after I got diagnosed with Covid, the swelling returned at the injection site.   As of today I have no redness or swelling anymore at the injection site.

Elaboration: the pain in my body was global and severe. At a time I could not move because my spine and neck felt like they were in fire. I also felt like vomiting, but could not. These symptoms continued through the night and into the next day with periods of feeling extremely hot and sweating and having chills like ice and sweating.

On 1/14, I noticed the left supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged, no pain with palpitation. On 1/15 the underside of my left arm was itchy but no visible rash. On 1/16 the arm was still itchy and the lymph node was more enlarged. No neck or axillary nodes were enlarged. On 1/17 in the morning I woke up with a large red rash on my left deltoid. It was not itchy, but as the day went on was more red, raised, and warm. The node in my neck was causing some neck discomfort. I presented to Urgent Care and was treated for a local reaction. I was given a steroid cream to use on my arm and was told to take an OTC antihistamine. I have been using the cream for 2 days and so far the rash is resolving but is still visible. The node has not yet decreased in size.

Full body ichy rash stared  4 nd day, after fever aches went away.  Went to my dr on 1/16 since rash did not go away, kept spreading getting worse all over my body.  Dr diagnoised it as some areas posrisis  other areas as eczema.  I have never had either in my life, and have no allergies to anything.  She told me it may go away, or i may have it for life, the moderna triggued an auto immunne disorder.  she gave me a shot of predinsone,  and scripted cream.  Dr said I should not get the 2nd dose of vaccine, and to come back 3 times a year for the predisone shot to keep it under control

On 1/19 it was noticed that injection site was red,  slightly raised and warm. On 1/19 I also noticed that the armpit of the vaccinated arm felt very sore and tender to touch. On 1/20 that soreness has spread down to elbow and redness has remained at injection site.

                                                Starting 01/16/2021, there was itchiness and a cluster of red papules/wheals that showed up on my right back. The rash continued to spread the next few days with increasing papules and itchiness. The rash is localized to my torso. Most are on my right abdomen and right back but is now spreading to my left side and upper back. There are also a few under and on my right breast and below both my armpit areas. The rash is still erythematous, with some that are papular and some appearing like vesicles. There is still itchiness and some stinging sensation. I am currently on Hydroxyzine 25MG at night and Zyrtec OTC during day but it has only been 2 days since I started the meds. The itch does wake me up at night time. So far the antihistamines have helped a bit with the itch. At the same time, I appear to have a sore throat though it feels more like a mild swelling of my throat as whenever I swallow it feels sore.

                                                About 30 min after the vaccination I felt dizzy. It felt almost like I had gotten up too quickly and felt dizzy, that kind of dizziness. Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

                                                I started to notice on Tuesday, January 19th, that there was a red bump on my arm. It looked more like a mosquito bite to me and was not bigger than a quarter. It didn?t feel itchy but I thought nothing of it. I noticed when I got home it was twice as big but I still felt no pain. It appeared that my arm was also swollen. The following day on Wednesday, it has grown in size again covering my arm, maybe the size of four quarters. Throughout the day it felt a bit hot, especially when I touched it. It did not feel itchy and I didn?t feel any pain. I felt a bit tired this day so I?m not sure if it was because of it. The redness has gone down today (Friday, January 22nd) however the mark is still big and in the shape of a square now. The outer part of the mark is more red and raised up, like it has a red border.

It is slightly swollen and mildly tender but not itchy or painful otherwise. I should note that I had a rather significant amount of swelling and pain for the first few days after the injection, but it subsided after 4-5 days.

After a week of receiving vaccine: got noticeably more itchy, and swollen.  Redness (seemed to be like a rash with no hives) started to grow in size everyday. Used Benadryl which didn?t seem to stop it.   Now it?s been two weeks since I?ve received the shot and rash is still here, currently using cortizone-10 to help with itchiness

The muscle soreness was there for 3 days.  It was very hard to walk for a while cause of just the soreness.  I still feel a little in my ankles and toes still but fully recovered.

It had a knot on it and a red ring about 3 inches around the injection site. I placed a cold pack on my arm for 15-20 minutes. The area was still hot to touch for another 12-24 hours. The hotness has subsided and most of the itching, but my arm still feels sore and has about a 2.5 inch red area around it. Note that my swelling, redness and itching had completely subsided before this particular shower. I did not use any different products in my shower than I had used the days previously following my injection.

                                                At the time of the vaccination, I experienced a sore arm for about 48 hours, and muscle aches and chills for about 12 hours.   7 days after receiving the vaccination, I noticed a rash at the injection site. It was somewhat itchy for 2 days, and continue to grew in size for 4 days. The rash was improved by taking over the counter allergy medicine (Allegra 24 hour). It was slightly raised and swollen the first 2 days, but decreased over the following days although the rash itself got larger.  I did not seek medical attention because I did not have any other symptoms or side effects with the rash, and was able to self-treat with allergy meds.

                                                Despite not having any abnormal reactions immediately following the vaccine (except for pain at site of injection, muscle aches, chills - which went away after 3 days), a week after the vaccine, I noticed that my left arm was hard around the injection, and a bit itchy. I massaged it a bit, and it started hurting - that night, I woke up from the pain, and had to take ibuprofen to sleep (probably 4/10). The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better. This went on all of Friday as well - I took some Benadryl, and that seemed to make it better (or it might have just made me sleepy enough that I didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not sure). I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness. Sunday, the redness in both areas continued to fade, but the bumps were noticeable and more itchy than before. The hardness seems to have resolved almost completely, although the area is still a bit sore when massaged.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

I put cold compresses on it that afternoon and took a Benadryl for a couple of days and it resolved on its own.

                                                7 days after receiving the vaccine, I developed a large, warm red blotch about 3-4in in diameter on my left deltoid. The following day, this blotch spread more than an inch down my arm and developed a prominent red ring around the border.  For a couple days, I took Zyrtec, thinking I may have been bitten by something, which had no effect. 10 days after getting the vaccine, I had an in-person appointment with my PCP who examined my arm and reported to me that this has been seen in patients who received the Moderna vaccine, usually appearing 5-7 days following vaccine administration. Today (11 days after the vaccine), the blotch continues to spread but appears less red and is clearing in the center where it originated. No fever, minimal swelling, hot/warm to the touch at times, no itching, border is slightly raised at times. I was told to monitor and call if I see red streaks traveling from the area indicating infections.

Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

                                                Very itchy arm that has persisted, this far, to a month after getting the vaccine. At the injection site and around that general portion of my upper arm. Sometimes it&#39;s perfectly fine, sometimes it&#39;s red or pink and either will or will not be itchy as well. If I scratch at it too much, which I try really hard not to but it&#39;s really hard not to, and then the little rash-looking areas turns into a small area of mini skin hives. Still redish/pink and itchy. Then I try not to mess with it for the most part, but it&#39;s just consisted since then. Idk if this is a me problem, specifically cause I got some weird skin hive stuff going on actually on my eyes at night (randomly) that randomly occur. And that started way before I got the vaccine. With the hives on my arms, it will persist for a while at a time and go away before coming right back again as itchy as ever. It&#39;s been basically every single day since I got my vaccine that these side effects have been going on. #StillSupportIt lol. (:

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was able to taste the vaccine,. Within 5 minutes I felt dizzy and within 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t feel my arm.  I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

                                                I developed red, itchy blotches on the right side of my stomach approximately 1.5 weeks after my first Moderna dose. I did not take any medications to treat these symptoms and they have faded away for the most part. There is significantly less redness and no longer an urge to scratch.  I have not experienced any other serious adverse reactions. I was advised to see an allergist, however, my insurance requires that I see my PCP to get a prior auth/referral for an allergy specialist. The allergist that is contracted with the Super POD has a 50&#43; person waitlist and I will be going to my local urgent care to see a provider.

Later in the day I noticed that same area turn red. The following day the reddened, itchy, area became slightly darker in color but less red and had a darker ring around the edge of the discolored area. The next day the discolored area looked the same. By Friday (2/26/2021) the discolored area began to go away but the ring around it was still prominent.

                                                1 week and 1 day later it was noted while showering that there was a 2 in red raised mark surrounding the injection site that was itchy. 2 days prior to red mark appearing I was experiencing extreme headaches, fatigue, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. At this time on 2/28/2021, I still have the raised red mark on my area but it has lightened and it is still itching. My lymph nodes are still swollen and a headache is still present as well as fatigue but the sore throat has mostly resolved.

Took 2 Tylenol every 6 hours, lots of fluids, took 2 ibuprofen about 30 hours after getting vaccine because fever would not reduce.  Symptoms began to subside 32 hours after vaccine.

                                                pt stated that 10 minutes after receiving the covid vax her throat started closing so she went to the ER.  She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.
