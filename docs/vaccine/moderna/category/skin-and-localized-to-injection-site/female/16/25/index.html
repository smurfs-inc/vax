                                                Client came to be vaccinated accompanied by her father on Saturday January 23, 2021. The greeting table in the front was very busy and a lot going on. The client had registered online and had her paper to prove it when she was escorted to he next tables to be registered. There was nothing adverse about her registration form. Date of birth was listed, however, it was not caught that she was less than 18 to receive Moderna. We advertise that it is the Moderna vaccine that we have. Father never said anything and stood off to the side waiting for her to be observed for 15 minutes. On Monday, January 25, I spoke with client who answered phone, to explain what happened and to see if she was OK. States her arm at injection site hurt a little, but nothing else. I said I would call each day to make sure she was OK. Later in the day, she left a message to call her. I called and she wanted to know what vaccine she would get as her second dose. I said it would not be Moderna and that I could find some information and call her back. Then she states she has a lawyer and to whom should she address it to. I said the Health Officer at the city.

First 0.5 ML IM dose of Moderna lot #046A21A administered on 03/21/2021. Second 0.5 ML IM dose of Moderna lot #042B21A administered on 04/18/2021. Patient denied adverse reaction to both doses of Moderna, only slight soreness at vaccination site for first dose on 03/21/2021. Nurse Co-Lead then spoke to all Moderna vaccinators and ancillary staff assigned for 04/18/2021, I reiterated the correct age groups for both Moderna and Pfizer. Our vaccination sites have today&#39;s date for allowing to vaccinate to which age group and for which vaccine on the walls of each nursing station within the vaccinator&#39;s view. In addition, our reception desk inside the building and now outside check in table have these daily reminders visibly in front of them. Nurse Co-Lead spoke to the nurse specifically that administered the first dose of Moderna on 03/21/2021 and re-educated the medication rights and agreed to the methods in preventing this error in the future. Nurse Co-Lead spoke to Lead Ancillary to re-educate and reiterate her ancillary staff each day as well. Nurse Lead produced a new nurse station safety checklist that includes medication rights, correct age group for each vaccine, and verbal consent from patient, and the 3 contraindication questions for the vaccinator/nurse to hold the vaccine. Nurse Co-Lead spoke to lead registration table ancillary lead as well as the site manager that oversees the ancillary staff outside the building as initial check in staff. Nurse Co-Lead and Nurse Lead agreed to have end of day huddle to re-iterate today&#39;s captured vaccination error and methods to prevent in the future. Patient along with her legal Guardian verbally consented and agreed to complete Moderna series.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

The next day more hives appeared on knees and the ones on feet got worse.  The day after that hives also appeared on hips and elbows.  On 1/27 went to Doctor&#39;s office and received steroid shot to stop the allergic reaction. Took 5-7 days for all the hives to disappear. Based on the allergic reaction to the first dose, doctor recommended not taking the second dose as reaction could be more severe and/or have an asthma attack.

                                                18 year old female came to hospital for chest tightness, choking sensation in the throat as well as skin rash after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.  Initially patient presented to emergency room but subsequently discharged on steroid and Benadryl.  Patient had continued episode of choking as well as chest tightness and skin rash for that patient came back to emergency room.  Patient had received total 5 doses of epi pen because of that.  Patient was admitted to medical floor initially.  Patient was given steroid, Benadryl and famotidine.  Patient had 2 episodes on medical floor where she started feeling choking and chest tightness.  Patient remained stable hemodynamically except for tachycardia.  Patient was transferred to intensive care unit for close monitoring.  D-dimer was negative, urine tox screen was negative, COVID-19 PCR was negative, EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  CT scan of neck was negative.  We had discussed that patient has remained stable hemodynamically in the intensive care unit and discharge planning was discussed and patient was getting ready to be discharged when she had another episode where after drinking soda patient started having that choking sensation, patient remained stable hemodynamically during this episode as well.  Her symptoms had improved.  She looked visibly anxious.  Patient was monitored in the ICU for few more hours and patient remained stable.  I checked back on her and she was able to eat her lunch.  She probably had a allergic reaction to more than a vaccine but subsequent episodes are thought to be secondary to anxiety attack given situation.

She noticed a reaction about 10 days later, and it presented as a red rash on her body. This rash did get worse after the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine on 2/1/21. The rash is red and raised and does itch. It is all on 4 extremities, her abdomen, and her back. It is on her face, and on her scalp. She did a telehealth visit with an MD who prescribed her steroid cream. This did not help, and she has a dermatology appt on 3/30/21.   I wish there was a way I could upload pictures because what I am describing does not do it justice. Her entire body is covered with this rash, and it is causing her a lot of discomfort. She did state the red, raised areas bleed if she scratches them, which she avoids trying to do.

Nurse, the immunizer, was there with her and her mother the entire time. We observed pt for over 30minutes and they left the pharmacy with no other symptoms.  I called pt the next morning and she stated that fainting was a \&#34;normal reaction...I get it everytime I get a shot\&#34;.  She is in between doctors right now and does not feel like we need to contact him.  Will talk to her new doctor next time she is seen

Immunizer then turned around to give her brother vaccination. When he was turned around, he heard the patient&#39;s phone that she was holding dropped and that she had jerked her arm, which caused her phone to drop. When I went to the patient, she was crying and hyperventilating. I told her to put her head down and take deep breaths. I checked on pt in 15 min, was doing better but had burning sensation at injection site. Kept pt at pharmacy for 30 minutes.

Approximately 24 hours after vaccination, she developed a headache. Approximately 48 hours after vaccination, she developed a rash that  spread from the neck to the legs. She went to Hospital Emergency Room. In the ER she was given Banophen (Benadryl) and famotidine. Later that same day, the symptoms resolved. At approximately 9am on May 5, 2021, the rash returned and spread to the palms of the hands and the face. At approximately 11:20 am, the patient took Banophen and famotidine. She called the pharmacy around noon for advise, as the rash was still present. Patient was advised to call her primary care physician.

                                                8 days after injection I had a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (?covid vaccine arm?), symptoms included firmness and a red patch on my upper arm near the injection site. The following morning, I woke up feeling well with the rash still on my arm (no change). 2 hours later I began feeling dizzy and fainted. I was unconscious for 5 to 10 seconds. When I woke up, the rash had vanished and the firmness was gone. No signs of the reaction were present after waking.

                                                The first day, I had slight arm soreness with nothing more. When I woke up on day two, I noticed my arm had swelled more than usual (basing off my previous dose in my right arm) and was extremely hot, tender, and had two circular red patches. That night, the redness and swelling had spread into a medium sized circle, and began to itch and still be very hot upon touch. Upon looking later that night, at approximately 11pm EST, the swelling and redness had gotten larger.  On day three, the redness only got worse, and is slowly spread more over the area, with intense itching, but no longer is as sore as it was the day prior. I have iced the area, moved my arm around more to help the swelling go down, taken a hot shower, and about 600mg of Ibuprofen each day since the second dose. The only outcome to those treatments has been a significant decrease in pain level, but the swelling and redness still continues. This has all been over about a 48-72 hour time period

Needed assistance to stand and could not hold a pencil to write. Also numbness and tingling in hands and fingers. Face slightly swollen and red.  400 mg Ibuprofen was administered at  1530. Pushed fluids as soon as fever began. Cooling measures provided, cool shower, cold compress, change of clothes to light pajamas.  We contacted our Insurance 24 hour Nurse line at approximately 2100 when symptoms peaked. The RN on staff instructed us to seek immediate medical care.  We attempted to find an open Urgent Care unsuccessfully and tried to go to an ER but they were full. Fever began to come down around 2230, so we returned home. Continued with ibuprofen every six hours and cooling measures.

Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

One week from the date of my vaccine, I woke up with a swollen and red arm below the injection site. It was itchy and painful. This has persisted for two days and I saw a physician for it. We are currently monitoring the site for possible cellulitis.

She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

It is warm and  painful; however, the patient says it is not getting more painful.  The actually injection point as a raised, smooth, moderately dark pink wheal about  4 X 4 mm.  No drainage at site.  The Wheal reminds me of an old smallpox  vaccine scar.

Patient presents on 1/27/2021 after onset of pain, decreased ROM ongoing since administration.  I was able to visualize ecchymotic area where vaccine was administered and patient has photo evidence.  The physician responsible for the vaccine administration needs to be retrained on where to give deltoid muscle IM injections and to avoid the extremities where recent surgeries occurred (patient had right shoulder labrum repair in October 2020)

                                                The site of the injection felt itchy for days following the injection. On February 12, I noticed an itchy bump on my right hip. The next morning, there were itchy, hard bumps on my feet and right ring finger. The bumps on my feet have become swollen and warm and seem to be growing larger, especially today on February 14. Two small bumps have also developed on my hands. I am not sure whether this is related to the vaccine, but it has become painful to walk.

                                                On 01/19/2021, 4 days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, a small, splotchy red patch appeared on my left arm beneath where I received the vaccine. Over the next few days, the rash became increasingly red and square-shaped. By the time I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 02/12/2021, the rash had mostly subsided with some general redness remaining. Then on 02/13/2021, the rash reappeared as a milder and smaller version of the original rash. No treatment has been used, and I have not seen a medical professional about the rash. As of 02/15/2021, the rash is still present.

She cam back in side the room and we had a nurse assess her, her BP and heart rate were a  little elevated. We gave her some water and had her sit for some extra time while we talked to her. She has a child hood trauma regarding vaccine and had just had a major panic attack before and during her vaccination. We were all  pretty sure she had just worked her self up and was not feeling well because of that and she said as much herself. After about 15-20 more minutes her BP and heart rate were back to normal and although still feeling a little weak she was ready to go home with her mother.

By 3am I figured the only reason I wasn?t sleep was from the vaccine. I then started to feel extremely nauseous and had chills. At 3:30 am I took my temperature and it was 100.5. I laid in bed until 5am with no sleep still and took my temperature again and it was 103.5. I went back into my bed and fell asleep around 5:30 am. The next day I felt as though I had been hit by a truck. I felt extremely groggy and achy and my temperature when I woke up was around 100. Overall, I felt awful.

                                                I got my shot, sat down, and was reading through the information that the clinic provided me. A few minutes after, I noticed my right arm was getting warm, but I thought I was being paranoid (placebo effect). I began to feel nauseated. About another 5 minutes after feeling warm and nauseous, my ears began to ring and my vision went white. I was cold but sweating. I have passed out a handful of times before for various reasons, so I knew what was happening. I tried to signal to a volunteer from my seat that I needed help, but I ended up laying on the ground by my chair before someone came over. Once I laid down, the attention of the volunteers and nurses was on me. Three came over to assist me. They held my legs up,  kept a hand on my wrist for a pulse, and fetched water. I talked myself through the dizziness and ringing in my ears. They put a cold rag on my forehead and had smelling salts on hand. Once I began to feel better, they helped me slowly sit up, and eventually helped me stand up and get into a chair. They kept a close eye on me for the next 30 minutes to make sure I didn?t have any other reactions.

                                                Within 5 minutes after receiving vaccine, patient indicated that it felt like her whole body was on fire and she felt faint.  She was already seated for observation following the dose.  An Epi-Pen and ammonia inhalants were removed from the emergency kit  for possible use.  Pt stated she  was not having difficulty  breathing and no closing of her throat.  The ammonia inhalant helped the patient focus and she stated that it made her feel better.  Pharmacy staff called 911 and the EMS crew arrived in approximately 5 minutes.  They evaluated the patient and transported her to the local emergency room.  A couple of hours later the patient called and said she had been discharged and was doing well.  While in the emergency room she broke  out in hives and was given epinephrine and benadryl per her conversation.  Later her father came to the pharmacy and confirmed the same. She will see her primary care doctor on Monday.

                                                About 6-7 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started to develop hives around my body, including on feet, stomach, ears, face, back, and legs. I had fever and chills, muscle aches, joint pain,  headaches,  and nausea later that night as well. The next morning, my left eye was swollen, left side of tongue completely swollen, lips swollen, and left side of throat closed (anaphylaxis). I took prednisone, Benadryl, and Tylenol to relieve the symptoms, and the swelling around my left eye, tongue, throat, and lips went away. Throughout the day, more hives have developed around my body and face, including my right eye.  I am continuing to take Benadryl and Tylenol and finish doses of prednisone. The fever and chills, muscles aches, joint pains, hives, headache, and nausea are still present.

The rash is itchy and has not gone away or gotten better a day later and it still seems to be multiplying. I felt difficulty breathing but I cannot be sure cause I was nervous I may have been scared after seeing the rash on my body.

                                                Mother alerted pharmacists before administration that their daughter experiences syncope with needles. The mother sat by her side as I administered the vaccine. The patient said that the vaccine hurt and sat their for about 5 minutes . At that time the patient said she did not feel well and laid on the ground. It is unclear if patient passed out for a few seconds. I spoke with patient to make sure she was conscious and then monitored her to look for signs of anaphylaxis. Her symptoms appeared to by related to anxiety rather that anaphylaxis. The pharmacy did call 911, but the patient and her family turned down the emergency service. I sat with patient for about 45 minutes to monitor her condition. When she improved they decided to leave that pharmacy. I did suggest they be looked at by a physician. We also called and check on patients well being and she seems to be doing fine.

I gave her a bottle of diphenhydramine liquid and directions for use.  I followed up with the patient the following day and she said she continued to feel fine.

Pain took about 5 hours to travel to hand.  Still having pain from shoulder to elbow.  Also having nausea, fatigue, fever, and kind of out of focus of reality.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

                                                On the night I received the COVID-19 vaccine, I had a fever that went up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. In the morning 24 hours after I had the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I felt a little better from the night&#39;s fever and ate instant ramen, oranges, acetaminophen, and a vitamin C tablet. This was at about 8:45 AM. A few minutes or a minute after I swallowed the acetaminophen and vitamin C, I got a severe allergic reaction that led to me going to the Emergency Room. I have eaten these things before and am not allergic to acetaminophen, vitamin C, or anything in the instant ramen. The reaction was first felt by a shortness of breath and I could barely breath. Then, hives started to form on my face and my lips and face became extremely swollen. I then ended up throwing up after my mom gave be a Benadryl pill and I drank another Benadryl after.  My face had become less swollen but it was still difficult to breath and hives started to form all over my body so we decided to rush to the Emergency Room. We got to the Emergency Room at about 9:30 AM and the hives on my body were worse. They were able to calm down the reaction by giving me more Benadryl through an IV and steroids. They knew I had the second dose of the vaccine so they did not give me anything that would suppress my immune system. Timewise, it could be the acetaminophen, but I have taken acetaminophen in the past many times before without a reaction.

                                                Unsure exactly when started but definitely started at least 24h after vaccine. Deltoid was swollen and hard after vaccine which I think it normal, but I had redness sort of under it/toward the front of my arm. Today is now 2 days post vaccine and it has become itchy and painful. I looked it up and saw others are reporting similar things HOWEVER, mine is at least about 4-5 inches away from injection site. I think it may be a mild allergic reaction. I haven?t treated it yet because I don?t know what to do, and I?m hoping it won?t worsen.

                                                My entire face was covered with hives. Within 2 hours of the vaccine I developed hives to the bilateral aspect of my face, forehead, cheeks and eyelids. My hives were itchy and red and I have never experienced this before. I did not consume any new food or use any new products. I took Benadryl for the itchiness. I had a telemedicine visit and I also had a Covid-19 test which was negative. I called health and also reported this adverse reaction. Moreover, I had no reaction to my second dose which was on 01-28-2021.

I have never before had a swollen lymph node in either axillary regions of my arm. It was very painful, I could barely put my arm down because of the pressure of it pressing against the side of my body at rest. It has gotten better, there isn?t as much pain but it is still uncomfortable. The lymph node was/is palpable, and hurt upon touch and rest. The pain was an 7/10, but has now gone down to a 2/10. My arm is also still sore from the injection site, but it is not bad.

                                                Around 2:30-3pm I began feeling tired. I went to lay down and rest and started to get chills and a bad headache along with hot and cold episodes.   I started to sweat but had no fever at the time. This continued all night. I had no appetite after receiving my vaccine. Around 6:30 I started to get a fever of 100.3 and continued chills with headaches. I took Tylenol when needed. My whole body was sore throughout the day and got worse are the night progressed. My fever was in and out but around 9pm I had the highest temp of 101.4. I didn&#39;t get good sleep due to feeling unwell all night. I belive I stared feeling more myself sometime around 9:34am. But was still feeling a bit warm. But felt way better as the day progressed. My left arm where I received my shot is still very sore. And I still don&#39;t have an appetite.

Approximately 2 hours later, she began developing a reddened area on her arm at the injection site which was hot to touch and became itchy.  She reached out to our onsite nurse on 08MAR21.  She iced the area and took Benadryl.  She was told to follow-up with our onsite nurse if her condition didn&#39;t improve.  On 10MAR21, she reported she has been taking Benadryl HS and the area is &#34;almost completely cleared up.&#34;

                                                1 week after recieving the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, I bumped my right arm about 2 inches below the injection site. Throughout the course of the day, my arm progressively became swollen and sore, to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it much or sleep on it. The next day it got progressively better on its own, and then I began taking an antibiotic prescribed by my doctor that helped it heal the rest of the way. I&#39;m not positive if the rest of the healing was on its own, or directly because of the antibiotic.

On 3/12/21, she started feeling jaw pain on same side of injection and shoulder pain intensified plus numbness.  Patient says the pain and numbness  comes and goes. She is due for her next  dose on Saturday, March 28 but decided to wait  a little bit longer before she gets her second dose.

I sat with her for about 30 to 40 minutes to make sure she was maintaining normal breathing.  She did take some oral Diphenhydramine as was very itchy and red. She did have friend with her and we instructed her to go to ER if got worse.  Next day 3/24/21 patient called and said she had a productive cough and was advised by staff pharmacist to go to Dr.  She called back and said did go to Dr. and was prescribed steroids and antihistamine (was on steroid at time of vaccination but we were unaware) and Dr told patient not to get 2nd vaccination. Patient was doing better but not completely recovered

The rash worsened after my second dose 4 weeks later. It has now been almost 8 weeks since the rash appeared, and it still has not gone away. It looks like small red and yellow bumps covering my upper arm. There is no soreness or itchiness associated with the bumps, but they do seem to improve but then return.

When she woke up, she was covered in hives on her face, down her neck, all over her back and down her arms.  The hives up her spine were the size of quarters.  Immediately gave her 2 mg tabs of Benadryl and used Caladryl lotion to control the itching. After 1 hour, Patient took a cold shower to stop the spread of the hives and re-applied additional Caladryl.  Maintained the Benadryl dosing throughout the rest of the day into the next day continuously.  As of this writing on 3/31/2021, Patient still has hives on her arms.

I have a rash on my arm like a red welt, but it does not itch, it is just sore.  On the affected arm my hand shakes and it feels weaker than my other arm.

                                                I first began to form a rash where I received my vaccine. Over the course of an hour, it quickly began to swell and turn red. It was very sore, sensitive, and hot to the touch. By the end of the day,  a raised lump formed and was about 4 inches in diameter. The swelling lasted for about 3 days. I then decided to take Benadryl to help with the itchiness and swelling. Since taking that medication, the swelling has significantly gone down but is still present.

Repeated all throughout the night (Hot/cold). Took 500mg Tylenol at 12am that night. Woke up at 2am with a ~102.4 F fever. Took another Tylenol. Got out of bed around 8am 4/7 drenched in sweat. Felt nauseous and vomited almost right away and couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. Still had around 102 F so took 2 more Tylenols. Throughout that night and until Friday, I was achy all over my body. Also, lymph node under left arm pit was swollen and was sore along with my left arm. Throughout the day on 4/7, laid in bed trying to get rest and too nauseous to eat anything other than some cereal in the morning and plain noodles later in the day. Took another Tylenol in the afternoon because I was still staying at 102 F fever. Was slightly dizzy when standing up or moving too fast. I slept the next night and felt fine 4/8 morning (no fever), but felt worse as the day went on, aching everywhere and feeling more and more dizzy. Friday 4/9, I woke up in the morning and when I first started walking, I fell on the floor because of extreme dizziness. The whole day I was extremely dizzy and I&#39;ve never had vertigo before, but it seemed like that based on explanations of it. Also had painful headache every time I stood up, but was fine when I wasn&#39;t moving. The next day it was mild dizziness and completely gone the day after that.  Also, Thursday 4/8 around 7:30pm, I noticed I had hives on the back of my right hand. Not 100% sure if it&#39;s due to the vaccine, but I&#39;m not sure what else would have caused it and it&#39;s worth noting. It was gone the next day.

                                                On the day of the vaccine, I had pain in my arm where I got the shot hours later.  I had a bit of a fever and chills that night.  The next day I began to get bumps on the arm that I got the shot at around 2:00 pm. I took an allergy antihistamine pill and it went away for a couple of hours. Later at night, I noticed small bumps and went to sleep. I woke up at around 6:00 am (2 days after getting the vaccine) and noticed I got hives all over my arms and legs. I went to urgent care and they said I should just continue using the antihistamines. I did and it has been two weeks since the vaccine and every day I still get hives. Not one day has passed where I have not gotten an allergic reaction with hives.

                                                Around 11:00 in the morning I was starting to feel weak and hard of breathing with a sore arm where the injection site was. As the day went on it progressed to muscle aches and a low fever, I went to bed with chills, muscle pain, heavy breathing, and a 100.8 fever. I work up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and felt nauseous, I don?t remember much but I remember waking up on the floor in a cold sweat, so I assume I passed out from the nausea. I went back to bed and I woke up with a 101.8 fever and weakness and muscle pains. My mother told me to take Tylenol every 4 hours and be on top of things, my symptoms have been decreasing since this morning but as I am filling this out at 11:00 at night I?m slowly getting my fever back. I will add this is exactly how I felt when I got covid back in November of 2020.

Slowly the rash spread to entire face including the neck region. At 72 hours post vaccination she noted swelling and redness around the lips with tightness in chest prompting here to seek help. Noted to have generalized swelling and erythema to face along with the periorbital area and eye lids on exam [ after Benadryl]- no respiratory distress.  Reaction thought to possibly be an acute worsening of her underlying eczema but could not rule out vaccine reaction.  Treated with Benadryl, Zyrtec and Prednisone

I could not do anything for a long time. I laid on the floor for a while and watched videos. I felt better once I did that. I got tired from sitting and laid on the floor. It went until 4 pm April 24 2021. I got up and was fine after taking a nap on the floor.  April 24, 2021 I got a small headache that was there and now comes and goes with longer time periods. From the time I got the shot 10:43am, I felt a headache after it was done to 5pm. It is now going away at 6pm.  I feel pain at the place of shot even more at 3pm it started now at 6pm it has increased. It is bearable.

Shortly after it became hard to swallow as my throat was closing. I went to Emergency Department around 10p. The doctors administered Epinephrine (via Epi Pen) and Pepcid through an IV. I was prescribed an Epi Pen as well as Claritin and Omeprazole for 14 days.

I woke up at 4:00am on 5/1 with a fever of 99.9F and chills. I decided to take a hot shower because I couldn?t get warm. At the end of my shower I suddenly got a ?sickly? feeling in my chest, similar to symptoms of a chest cold. My vision started going black, almost like when you stand up too quickly. I experienced a sudden throbbing headache out of nowhere. My ears were ringing with partial hearing loss, and I started getting very nauseous. I stumbled out of the shower and immediately vomited.

No second dose administered. EMT arrived and did full vitals workup. She left on her own power per EMT group and went to the local hospital for observation. Pharmacist followed up after 2 hours and patient is doing well.

                                                1 week after receiving the vaccination, a red welt appeared on my arm where the injection was given. It was hot, raised and itchy and about an inch and a half wide and long. I drew a line around it. The next day it was less itchy and hot but had gone about half an inch outside the initial lines. The third/ fourth day it was barely raised at all but had gotten even larger, now about 1.5-2inches outside the initial lines in some areas. It is now barely raised, barely red and has not gotten any larger since yesterday.

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

I had had a sore arm all day which I expected, but after trying to sleep it off I woke up around 2am shivering and sweating through my shirt at the same time, and had a 98.7 temperature (normally I am 97.2 so that&#39;s high for me). My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

On 1/6/21, the rash worsened, resulting in patient going to the ER. Benadryl was prescribed and she was told to follow up with her primary MD.

                                                Pt reported that at about 7pm the day of her vaccine she developed a rash on her left arm/leg. It was itchy and so she took a Benadryl. She said her &#34;throat felt thicker&#34; but the Benadryl helped. She went to sleep and was fine. When she woke up the next morning on 1-6-2021 she reported the rash had spread. When she got to work and found me about 9:30 am to ask if that was normal I encouraged her to call her PCP and take a Benadryl. At that time she was having no difficulty breathing. She chose to call her PCP and not take a Benadryl as it makes her sleepy.  After she called her PCP she ended up leaving work. I found out later that her breathing had become labored and her neck/throat was starting to swell. Per her report, her PCP gave her epi and steroids, and R/X her an epi pen. She took her medicine and Benadryl around the clock and returned to work on 1-8-2021. When I spoke to her on that day she stated all of her symptoms had resolved, but her lymph nodes in her neck were still a little swollen.

                                                The first two days after injection it was painful to lift arm above 30 degrees and hurt upon palpation and I had an overall tiredness. A week after the injection on 1/13/2021 I developed a raised, red rash surrounding the injection site (2in x 4 in). The skin that was inflamed was 101.2 degrees fahrenheit.  The intense rash lasted around 24 hours and subsided after 3 treatments of Benadryl cream and one dose of oral Benadryl. The skin is still slightly raised and has a slight redness to it today (1/15/2021) but is much better than before.

Soon after in the evening the patient had rash and hives on her upper torso and neck.  The hives spread the next day to eventually cover her entire body.  The pt. took a Benadryl and went to the hospital because of the severity of the hives and itching on day 2.   The staff told her that she should use hydrocortisone cream and should possibly not get the second dose of the vaccination.  The pt. continued to use both the Benadryl and hydrocortisone the following day, but still the hives persisted.   Pt. is on Day 4 and will let us know further details on her condition as time goes on.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine at 3:50pm on 01/25/2021. Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

I went back into the room and still couldn&#39;t breathe so they sat me down and told me my whole body was bright red and they stuck me with an epipen. The whole reaction probably lasted a  little less than a minute from the time it happened to when they stuck me with the epipen.

With the recommendation of a nurse friend, I drew a line around the affected area and the redness has grown past the line. The size of the redness is about 3.5 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall. The area is also very itchy. It is concerning because the redness had almost dissipated and now has come back over a week after the first dose.

                                                About an hour after administration, she started feeling like she couldn&#39;t catch her breath. She also stated that it felt like her tongue was too big for her mouth. She also stated that it looked like there was a mosquito bite at the site of administration. She took a benadryl (unknown strength) about 1 hour after developing the breathing symptoms, and an hour later, she was starting to feel better. As of 24 hours after, the administration site reaction is not resolved.

                                                After 8 days of my shot (today), I noticed I was pretty itchy on my arm at the injection site. When I finally got a good look at it, it was red and had, what seems to be, little hives around it. It?s also a little tiny bit swollen at that area. Very warm to the touch and I can now feel this continuous, residual heat around it now that it?s later on in the day.   Since it?s only the first day I noticed it, the size of the area is still rather small. I don?t know if it will progress to be any bigger than it is now or if its appearance will change in the future.

At around 4:00 pm, I felt mild joint pain in my right ankle which worsened to mild/moderate joint pain in my left elbow/wrist &#43; both ankles/knees, so I took an extra strength acetaminophen (500 mg) around 4:30 pm. My joint pain subsided, and I began to feel fatigued around 5:00 pm. Mild chills began around 9:30 pm, and joint pain at the same sites resumed around 10:00 pm. I went to bed around 12:00 am with moderate chills, mild joint pain, and mild pain at the injection site, but I awoke around 12:45 am with slightly worsened chills, joint pain, and pain at the injection site. I took another extra strength acetaminophen and was able to sleep for the rest of the night. I woke up at 9:00 am with no symptoms.

Then, on Feb 13th a rash started to reappear that was warm to the touch and itchy and burning. I applied cortisone but rash on injection site kept growing. On Feb 14th, I woke up and rash was a bit smaller but every two hours I would have a tingling sensation like when your foot falls asleep but it went up my shoulder and back area up to my neck and occurred every 2 hours. I then was advised to take claratin, add more cortisone, and take Benadryl as well. The itchiness stoped. My rash is still there but it?s very light compared to feb 13th.

This was NOT wittnessed; she does NOT recall passing out or hitting her head. A co-worker noticed something wasn&#39;t right &amp; had her sit down. They called my wife who picked her up &amp; brought home &amp; rested. Approximately 5.5 hours later, after feeling &#34;better,&#34; she got up to get something to eat. While returning to bed (to rest &amp; eat the small container of applesause) she felt as though she were going to pass out again &amp; quickly sat down on the steps. However, she did not call for me (I was in the room nextdoor) for a few minutes... seemingly having &#34;zoned out&#34; but she does not think she lost consciousness.

It is still itchy and slightly warm.

I couldn&#39;t see anything and I felt a little nauseous in the stomach. I was able to lay down for a couple of minutes and felt fine afterwards. Some of the symptoms going home are a sore arm, can&#39;t seem to lift it up, tired, the vaccine site seems to sting, and some chills.

She felt better after 30 minutes and proceeded to go eat in her bedroom.  She was nervous and anxious prior to the vaccine and states that she thought that had something to do with it.  She then experienced a 10 second bout of muscle tension in her face and jaw which caused her to be unable to talk or speak for a few seconds.  She was brought back down to the hall for evaluation.  She felt as if she was having a stroke and that got her more worked up.  She denies lower body weakness.  She states that her head feels heavy and she complains of general fatigue.  No n/v.  No headache or blurry vision.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had a really awful headache and swollen arm, that was incredibly touch-sensitive. Around 3 pm that day, 25 hours after the injection I was hit with severe nausea. About an hour later, I began vomiting and had diarrhea. For some time, I was unable to keep water down. I called a 24-hour nurse line, and they advised contacting my doctor&#39;s emergency line. I did, they said if I couldn&#39;t make it through the night without keeping water down I needed to go to the hospital. Luckily, right before bed I drank some water and was able to make it through the night. The next morning, I had a telehealth visit with someone from my doctors office to review symptoms. Today I have had waves of nausea, but no vomiting. I have had diarrhea, and I had a spontaneous period that was very heavy and two weeks early today (2 days post vaccine).

I slept with my mom in fear of having episode again. Around 2:45 am, my mom woke to me shaking like I was having a seizure. it lasted about 30 secs. she called 911 and i was checked out by paramedics, who said my vitals were fine and I should flollow up with medical care. My mom and I agreed that perhaps I needed stress dosing of Cortef. I took stress dosage and have been taking stress dosage all day and so far no more episodes.  Now waiting for Doctor to call me back and advise.

I woke up and could barely move my arm, and throughout the day I got progressively more fatigued. By the next night, I had a low-grade fever and had extreme all-over body soreness. It felt like I had the flu. By morning, I was feeling a bit better and got progressively better. The next day (2.5 days after the vaccine), I was feeling better other than some soreness in my injection site.

                                                Minutes after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, patient complained of difficulty breathing.  I asked if she was wheezing and she said no.  A doctor in the clinic came over and even though it wasn&#39;t time for patient and her sister to leave (based on 15-minutes after receiving the vaccine) he initially suggested that they might be fine to go, but after patient told him of her symptoms and at my urging he decided to have her stay a little longer.   I think it was at this time that he had someone check her pulse.  I don&#39;t know what the pulse reading was.  He stepped away and shortly afterwards patient started complaining that her throat felt strange and was making it hard to breathe.  The doctor immediately came back over, found patient was having difficulty breathing and holding herself upright in the chair.  I held her by the shoulders to keep her from falling while the doctor also steadied her and asked a worker in the room for an epi-pen.  The worker didn&#39;t seem to react much to the request so he told her louder that he needed an epi-pen.  She started searching her area and the doctor started yelling across the room to others that he needed an epi-pen.  It seemed like others initially took the demand less urgently than they should, but eventually someone came with an epi-pen.  By this time I don&#39;t think patient was very conscious, if at all.  Sometime during this time the doctor also instructed someone to call 911.  The doctor tried using the epi-pen but at first he had some kind of cap on it that prevented it from working.  He removed the cap and not finding an easy way to have a sterilized injection site he injected the epi-pen through patient&#39;s jeans.  Soon afterwards a cot was brought out and workers had me step aside as they took patient and put her on the cot.  Patient seemed to gradually become more aware of her surroundings and it wasn&#39;t long before she appeared to me to be fully conscious once again.  They checked her blood pressure and pulse and maybe did other tests during this time.  Eventually the ambulance arrived and patient was very clear with everyone that she did not want to incur the expenses of riding in the ambulance and I offered to bring her wherever they suggested that she should go.  They watched and evaluated her for a while and eventually had her sign the form declining the ambulance transportation.  They suggested that she make an appointment with her doctor but did not suggest that we take patient to an emergency room.  We departed and patient did not afterward  seem to experience any symptoms from the vaccine other than some of the general feelings of being sick, soreness at the injection site, etc. that others report with the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Reaction started out with a localized 3-4 inch inflamed reaction. It looked very similar to hives. This was on Friday, March 19th, 2021 around 9 PM. I went to sleep and woke up the next morning and it was still there. I took benadryl and one ibuprofen to help the inflammation and the reaction, but it only got worse following this. I then had intense tactile and mechanical allodynia, which is often associated with my diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but this has been very intense. The allodynia had been occurring across my left hand up to my elbow, but has now moved to both of my arms, my neck, my entire back (more severely around the ribs), my chest, and my feet. I am very fatigued and feel feverish. My current temperature is only 99.2, but the pain is still active. Today is Sunday, March 21st, 2021. I got the vaccine on Saturday, March 13th, 2021 and this reaction is following the vaccine about a week after.

                                                The syringe was larger and looked full. It took a long time for medication to go into the arm due to the amount of liquid injected into the muscle.  Right away the full left arm and breast were painful.  The arm pain continued to get worse and felt like she hit her funny bone but more extreme and this pain lasted all night into the next day.  She was unable to sleep due to the full arm pain.  The significant pain in the breast area lasted all day into the next day too. Also, felt chills and body aches starting that evening into the next day and night. We did not know the dose was only supposed to be 0.5 ml at the time of injection. We suspect she received at least 5 ml instead of the recommended 0.5ml.The name of the nurse that administered the vaccine is written on the vaccine card but not sure of spelling. RN?

Patinet recovered quickly when ambulance came but patient refused further medical care and has had history when given vaccine this dizziness occurs. Family member came to pick her up and walked without issue

                                                First day I had immediate swelling at the injection site, red circle form around the site of injection following up with an itch that lasted for 3 days. Along on those immediate symptoms I got the injection on my right arm and I experienced pain shooting up from my right arm into my neck and currently still have those pains from time to time when I move my right arm at an elevated angle. Day 4 of the vaccine I woke up one morning with swollen glands, congestion, swollen nasal glands, low grade fever of 100 degree F, very itchy irritated throat and hard to swallow, visited a clinic to see if I possibly had flu or strep but all my test results returned negative, also I had a covid test done and it was negative, I have never contracted covid 19 prior to vaccine and current day. Additionally, symptoms of congestion worsened and I am now experiencing some laryngitis due to the swelling of my lymph nodes, only sinus medication lessens the congestion to manage, I feel very fatigue, and experiencing some migraines.  Today only marks 1 weeks since the vaccine

Within the next hour, my jaw began to lock and my throat began to burn/tighten. Within this timespan, my body, especially my back began to ache as well as my chest feeling tight.  After three hours, I went to the on-campus clinic and they gave me 50mg of Benadryl.

                                                I received an allergy immunotherapy shot the day before my first dose of the vaccine and instantly felt nauseous and extremely tired after receiving the vaccine, which continued for two days after receiving tut. Three days later, I woke up struggling to breathe (but not anaphylactic), covered in hives, itchy all over, shaking, disoriented, and chilled but not truly feverish.  I reported this to my allergist, who prescribed prednisone and suggested the vaccine combined with immunotherapy were too much for my immune system for one week. The hives, itchiness, and difficulty breathing lasted about four days. I struggled with fatigue and nausea for over two weeks, stopping all school and work in the meantime. After my second dose, I feel just a bit tired and sore, so I think this truly was a bad reaction to the two injections combined rather than to the vaccine itself. Still, it was a debilitating experience,  and I would recommend considering putting out guidance that other immunotherapy patients space out their allergy injections and vaccines farther than I did.

I have been getting hives everyday since I got the shot in my thighs, chest, abdomen, arms, and back. Begins by feeling the urge to itch and once I start itching, raised bumps in a linear pattern will appear every where. Symptoms are only alleviated by taking Zyrtec daily. If I go more than one day without taking a Zyrtec, I begin to break out in hives at random time throughout the day every day. I have no previous allergies to food, no changes in my lifestyle or diet either.

                                                Fainting; Injection site soreness in arm; nauseous; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer  concerning a 21-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced, fainting (syncope), injection site soreness in arm (vaccination site pain), and nausea (nausea).  The patient&#39;s medical history included vasovagal condition that cause heart rate and blood pressure to drop due to stress on body and dehydration resulting in fainting. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 09 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 09 Feb 2021, the patient was fine until about 11 pm after which she experienced arm soreness on the injection site and felt nauseous.   On 10 Feb 2021, at 5 am in the morning, the patient fainted. The patient assumed that shot might have added stress to her body which most likely caused her to faint.   No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the event as patient would be receiving second dose on 09 Mar 2021.  The outcome of events, fainted (syncope), injection site soreness in arm (vaccination site pain), and nauseous (nausea), were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events of syncope, vaccination site pain, and nausea, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s prior medical history of vasovagal reactions is considered a contributing factor to syncope.

It lingered until the second dose which was on 1/23/2021 but did not resolve and only got worse after the second dose, the rash finally resolved 3 weeks following the second dose.

                                                Nurse made errors in administering vaccine. Lower-than-authorized dose volume administered. Fluid leaked out after removal of the needle. The fluid sat on top of vaccine site. Nurse also had trouble drawing vaccine fluid out of vial into needle, so I am unsure if the proper dosage was in the needle to begin with. Nurse pinched vaccination site, leading to potential subcutaneous injection. I did not see the angle or depth of which the needle entered.   3 hours after vaccination, large bump began to form on vaccination site. Has grown large as of time of writing, currently 1.5inch in diameter. Bump is hot and painful to the touch, and tender. Only other side effect is fatigue.

I?m not sure it?s related to the vaccine but it has never happened to me before. So I thought it would be best to report since if heard similar things from other women. It?s heavier than usual and more painful.  Also I had pain in my left armpit that went away after a few days that started about a week before my menstrual cycle. I?m guessing it was swollen lymph nodes due to the vaccine because I have seen other women report that as well.

By 48 hours, soreness peaked and the lump remained with warmth and itching when the area was touched with slight pressure. Between the 2nd and 14th day, the lump was still present (still 1.5 inches in diameter) with mild itching. I began to develop a dry cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue, and muscle fatigue that lasted from day 5 to day 11 following the Moderna injection. I went to get a COVID test and the results came back negative. After the 14th day the lump went down but now there is a discoloration of the skin where the lump was located that is still present 23 days after the first injection.   I did not use any medications or treatments to heal the adverse event nor sickness symptoms following the injection.

                                                At 10:40, the patient went in for her first Moderna vax.  She was slightly nervous since she&#39;s not a fan of needles. When she got it a vessel must have been nicked, because she experienced a bit of blood streaming down her arm which surprised us. The nurse wasn&#39;t concerned and stopped it quickly and cleaned up her arm.  Got her a new bandaid and she was sent to the chairs in the waiting area to wait her 15 minutes following the vax.    I had to pick up my regular prescription so I got in line while she was sitting there surfing on her phone.  As I got to the front of the line, the patient called me and said she was feeling lightheaded. I immediately left the line, and was there (I was maybe 15 feet away) and was asking how she felt. She said she felt sweaty and like she might pass out.  Right then, her eyes rolled a bit and closed and she went limp. I was able to hold on to her and a customer that was behind me in line and I were able to alert the nurse that gave the vax and the pharmacist. Both immediately came to our aid.  We got the patient on the floor and on her side.  The nurse wanted us to have an epi pen in case, but we all didn&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction. We checked her blood pressure and it was low.  Another employee was already calling an ambulance and another was getting her some juice. She was beginning to regain consciousness. She was only out for about 2 to 3 minutes at the most.  Her blood pressure was low, but started to come back to normal pretty quickly.  We had her lay there a few minutes and then sit up. Eventually we moved her to the chair a few minutes later.  Within another few minutes the emts arrived. She had already had answered questions for us like her name, birthday, where she was, etc.  The emts repeated those same questions, asked us what happened and rechecked her vitals.  All were back to normal.  They gave her the option of be transported to the ER, but given that she was feeling back to normal she declined and everybody felt good about that decision.

Patient reported that she first noticed the symptoms about 24 hours prior to reporting to clinic for evaluation. Patient presentation was consistent with injection site cellulitis  with probable cause of vaccine being given via the subcutaneous route.

                                                I have had hives since Monday may 17th. They get really itch but then some of the bumps stay for a day or two after it pops up.

                                                initially,  it was a splitting headache, piercing pain that came in waves and immobilized me.  It lasted two days and was worse when standing or moving.  It was less intense on the second day, but hives appeared on my left arm and my arm was more sore on the second day, and stayed sore for 5 days. The body aches started around 10:00 pm on the first day.  Then fatigue and joint pain.  Really awful.

                                                I have been having heart palpitations, an extra beat. I actually noticed this before May 21st, a few weeks after my first dose. I went on oral steroids that night because of hives and some allergic reaction I was having, never did find the cause for that. The palpitations were so much worse because of the steroids. I thought it would go away after finishing the medication but they have persisted. Some days are better than others. I saw a general doctor about it on the 26th.  I went to the cardiologist the next day but the EKG didn&#39;t show the palpitations. They are most frequent at night. No other symptoms, just uncomfortable flutters causing anxiety and stress. Myocarditis?

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

The next morning 12/29/2020 I woke up with a migraine and still had severe pain in my arm. That night (12/29/2020) I began feeling aches and pains throughout my body and felt that into the next morning (12/30/2020). The evening of 12/30/2020 I noticed a dollar coin sized red spot on my arm that was warm to the touch and was slightly raised. (By this time my arm pain had decreased but was still present.) The red spot had grown slightly by 12/31/2020 but not much. Friday 01/01/2021 I hadn&#39;t payed much attention to the spot but it looked the same. The morning of 01/02/2021 I woke up and had noticed that the spot had taken over a large portion of the outer bicep on my right arm.

Took Benadryl but did not do much and woke up the next day worse and with more spots.  Went to critical care and was given prednisone which has helped alleviate it but is not completely gone yet (1/5/2021).

                                                I received the Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/29. I had some minor swelling and soreness the first couple days after receiving the vaccine, but these symptoms both went away after a couple of days. A week later on 1/5, I noticed that the area where I had been injected was very swollen, red and itchy. It was localized to this year. There was some slight bruising around the top of where the swelling started. The area was not sore. There is still some redness and itching on 1/7 but the swelling has mostly gone down. I work in a community health center and had a PA I work with look at the reaction. I took some Benadryl as directed on 1/5 but have not treated the symptoms further.

On 12/28/2020 noticed the pain was back and I now have a medium sized lump in my armpit that was causing pain. On 12/31/2020 began to have a rash around the injection site that was increasing in size and limiting arm mobility. PCH EH sent CG to WorkMed and CG was given Rx for Keflex which was completed on 01/07/2021--CG stated symptoms are greatly improve.

No other side effects were noted aside from a sore arm and some itchiness around the injection site that lasted for 5 days after getting the vaccine. The lymph node is still swollen but is not worsening or painful. My sore arm and the itchiness have improved and are no longer an issue.

                                                I recieved the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/5/21 and did not experience any adverse reactions in the days following. Then, on 1/13/21 (8 days post vaccine) I noticed hives covering most of my body. My face was tingling and my lips were swollen. I took an antihistamine that evening hoping it would go away. The day after 1/14/21 I woke up with the hives all over my body, especially on my face. They were very severe and itchy. I went to my dermatologist and they recommended a steroid cream and oral antihistamine to help reduce the itching. It is now 1/15/20, and the hives are still covering most of my body with severe hives on my face.

Those symptoms have been observed for 2 days now.

There was no redness and minimal swelling, and all symptoms had vanished completely after two days. However, one week after the injection date,  I experienced a renewal of discomfort at the site of injection, accompanied by swelling, redness, and itchiness. So far, these are my only symptoms. It has about 18 hours since these new symptoms appeared, and they seem to be improving slightly.

                                                8 days after I received the moderna  vaccine, I noted a red, indurated rash/hive at the vaccine site. I was told by a provider that this delayed reaction was noted in some of the Moderna vaccine trials and given that I had no other symptoms (no fever, no warmth or signs of cellulitis) it would most likely go away in 3-5 days.  The next morning I woke up and my body was covered in hives. It is manageable with Benadryl. My roommate also had the exact same reaction, same timing, symptoms, etc and we both got the Moderna vaccine, same location, same lot, same time. Neither of us have allergies, and the other apartment mate has no symptoms (and has not received the vaccine).

                                                After receiving vaccination, patient developed breast tenderness, itching and was given Benadryl and Decadron.  She reported the itching resolved after the medications and then she is still complaining of breast pain.  She noticed 2 drops of fluid out of her right nipple.  I do not necessarily know that this is an allergic reaction I am just not sure what to make of the coincidence with the Covid immunization it could be entirely unrelated.  Advised follow-up with her PCP regarding these issues.  Return precautions discussed.  She verbalized agreement and understanding with plan of care.  Sent home from ED.

On the 21st I noticed these three red circles grew to where they merged into one large spot. I drew a pen line around the spot to monitor the growth. Today, 22nd, I noticed it grew past the pen line. I have drawn another pen line around the new growth and will continue to supervise it. No itching, pain. A little heat from it.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

About 3-4 days later, a red, tender rash developed in the armpit of the same arm of injection. The rash is dry and burns to the touch. There is also a small patch of rash on the right armpit (not arm of injection). The rash on the left armpit completely covers the area.

                                                Inflamed supraclavian lymph node and local site injection inflammation. Stated lymph node became inflammed the day after injection, which subsequently was misinterpreted by a physician as a potential aneurysm (pulsating mass), resulting in unnecessary hopsitalization. With reference to the site injection, left deltoid became red, itchy, and hot initally  surrounding local site only. However, as days progressed, reddening spread radially to extend to a final diameter of approxiamtely 5 inches, which also required medical intervention. I was presecribed steroids and anitbiotics which alleviated said symptoms. The symtpoms went away 3 weeks after first dose injection. Physicians advised against taking second dose.

The stiffness turned into nerve problems and I felt hot and tingly on my neck, back and head for several days. 8 days later from the vaccination day i got a huge rash on my left arm. On top of that my armpit area was severely sore . Soreness and pain from the arm continued 2 weeks later.

The rash was not raised and did not itch, but there was a mild tingling sensation to it.  40 hours post vaccine the rash  included my neck, stomach, upper back, and chest.   The rash was not raised and did not itch, but there was a mild tingling sensation to it.  The rash seemed to be the most intense between 40 to 44 hours post vaccine.  Following 44 hours post vaccine the rash began to gradually lighten and the tingling disappeared.  At 52 hours post vaccine the rash was barely noticeable in color with no tingling.

                                                Severe injection site pain (aching) approximately 3 hours after injection on 2/2. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 2200 to take the edge off of the pain in order to fall asleep. Beginning at 0600 on 2/3: Temp of 100 F, chills, body aches, headache. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 1000 which lowered temp and reduced other symptoms for approximately two hours. Symptoms returned at 1200 with temp reaching 100.2 F along with chills, headache, and body aches that were more intense in the shoulder/neck area. Used a heating pad along my back, shoulders, and neck which helped with the body aches. Slept from 1500 to 1800 and woke up with an intense frontal headache with pain shooting through my eyes as well. Temp was 100.7 F. Took 400 mg ibuprofen which made the symptoms more bearable. Tried to stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Also had two servings of soup. Symptoms seemed to lessen by 2200. The only symptoms lingering today, 2/4, are a slight headache, fatigue, and mental fog. Otherwise, condition has improved tremendously.

Day 11 after the vaccine, I noticed a red, asymptomatic ring around the injection site. I have never had a reaction to any vaccine or shot before. In total, I experienced fever, sore throat, muscle weakness, fatigue for 4 days after the symptoms started.

                                                Injection site pain making my right arm unusable, splitting headache, sharp, short pains on different places in my body including my back and knees, fatigue. Some mild nausea/loss of appetite. From the beginning of my symptoms to the end of them, my best estimate is about 36 hours. Taking an aspirin alleviated most of the symptoms to where I was more functional. I did call into work and skip a meeting the day after.

                                                At 6:30PM on 2/6 (29.5 hours after I received my 2nd Moderna vaccine dose), I developed a small cluster of hives on my left arm around the crease of my elbow (4-5 inches away from the injection site). The hives continued to spread outward until they covered about 25% of my arm 2-3 hours after the hives first appeared. This was the height of the pain/swelling/itchiness. The hives gradually moved upward along my arm and are currently an inch or two below my injection site (5 hours after the adverse effects began).

This lump went away after some time on its own.   Today, 02/06/21, the itchiness and pain returned, and what looked like a ?ridge? shape under my skin appeared on my arm at the site where the shot was administered.  It?s just bothersome but doesn?t impair my regular functionality. I intend to take a Benadryl and stay hydrated. Noticed I?ve been excessively thirsty today, much more than usual.

                                                I got my first dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine on Wednesday February 3rd. I was completely fine, definitely experienced a sore arm for 2-3 days. Noticed my injection site was pretty low to where you would normally put an IM injection. Also noticed, swelling locally around the injection site every day after getting the COVID vaccine. The j je tino site felt warm to the touch and was still swollen. Around Friday night, I started to get really itchy. Didn?t think much of it. Until I took a look on Saturday afternoon. My top half of my back, my neck and left ear where covered in small weird hives/bumps and was red and itchy. I took some Benadryl, and hoped it went away. It didn?t. Sunday morning my left ear was getting even more swollen, and this time the rash wasn?t all on my top back, but instead, traveled down my spine. This is when I decided to head to the ER since no urgent care was open, and they ruled it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave me a steroid and Benadryl injection IM, and am reporting this the morning after. I currently haven?t felt any itching or have noticed much swelling/redness. I think it?s also important to note that I?ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything, this my first ever, that I can recall.

I developed hives on my forehead, cheeks, neck, chest, and arms. The fingers on both my hands and my lips were tingling.  Treatment: I was rushed to the ER and given an IV steroid, IV fluids (2 bags), and IV benadryl.   Outcome: All the reactions went away within 4 hours and I was discharged from the ER. I was advised to take benadryl for 48 hours afterwards as needed and given a 5 day course of prednisone; 2 tablets taken daily.

Pt became flushed red in the face and face became warm. A minute thereafter breathing became difficulty and she began to feel some abdominal pain. After deep inhalation and exhalation, pt was administered a Benadryl 25mg and 8 ounces of water patient&#39;s color began to return and her breathing improved and her abdominal pain resolved. Patient was monitored for 30 minutes and assessed before departure.

He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

                                                The reaction is due to the SECOND dose in the series. I had a fever of 102.5 along with body aches, chills, etc, the day following the vaccine (2/9), but that resolved within 24 hours. The second day after was fine (2/10). The third day after I developed a deep red rash like pattern extending down my arm more than halfway down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was extremely high, just below the top of my shoulder and immediately below the body part of my shoulder, so the extent of the redness is ~6inches long.  It is extremely painful, warm to the touch, and slightly swollen. I went to the urgent care where I was diagnosed with cellulitis. I was prescribed doxycycline 100mg PO BID x5days. I am reporting this on the day of the reaction, and it is unknown how it will respond to the antibiotics or if it will get any worse.

That went away so I thought that it was fine, however, two days ago I looked in the mirror and I had a large red circle around the injection site. It is itchy, red, swollen, and sore. It has been over a week since I received the vaccine so I was a bit worried about it.

                                                Pain and soreness in arm through afternoon on 2/12 after getting vaccine. I started to get a small lump on my arm. That evening I had bad chills through the night and next morning. I took tylenol and got a low fever on 2/13. Lump was red and grew all day. Had low fever all day, increased to 101.6 in afternoon despite the Tylenol. Fatigue, headaches, and body aches. 2/14 I felt better in the morning. Headaches and fatigue still. Large red lump/swelling on arm (around 3 inches wide) at site of vaccination, arm still sore and painful to touch.

I?ve never experienced a migraine but I?ve had an extremely painful and debilitating migraine since 4am. Around 10am I was dry heaving and vomiting up bile. I have excruciating back pain since 10pm last night, horrible full body chills, fever of 102, skin, and light sensitivity.

Woke up in the middle of the night and realized there was a lump right above my collar bone. Then saw the faint rash in the morning and a little bit swollen. Itchiness is nothing too bad. Soreness started to go away, but lump still there.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

They are calling it ?covid arm? when researched. It appeared one week after the shot was administered and stayed for four days. I did not take any medicine besides Tylenol. I also had a swollen lymph node in the same armpit for a couple of days.

As the day has gone on, my arm has become swollen around the injection site, has become more sore, and it hot to the touch. There is no rash. The soreness/pain radiates down my arm and up my shoulder.

                                                Welt on right arm appeared the morning after I received the shot. About 2 inches in diameter (circular). It is a raised welt and is slightly itchy. Pain in about 4 on a 1-10 scale. Feels mostly like a bruise is being pushed on. I do have very sensitive skin so it is probably a slight allergic reaction. The doctor did an awesome job with the shot (10/10 hope she does it again). I feel great other than my arm being a little sore. No fever, headaches, etc. My arm has get slightly tingly today but nothing concerning. Definitely not a bad enough reaction to deter from getting the 2nd dose! :D

There?s a red spot and warmth where the shot was injected, but not visible swelling. Arm feels very weak, it shakes when I lift my arm.  I feel a throbbing pain while my arm is at rest.

Right arm was consistently sore and hard to lift above head. About 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, my right arm, shoulder, upper back, hand, fingers, knee, ankle, foot, and toes all began to feel tight and lose sensation. By March 12, I was walking with a limp and struggled to move my right arm at all.

                                                My legs became very itchy at 11:30 pm on Monday 3/15/21. I woke up at 8 am on Tuesday 3/16/2021 and noticed a large rash covering my legs, from my feet all the way up to my hips. The rash was large and blotchy, I have had allergic reactions before but nothing like this one and it was extremely itchy. I called my primary physician and allergist, they said to go to an ER or urgent care. I went to an urgent care at 12 pm on 3/16/2021 where they gave me a 125 mg steroid shot and prescribed prednisone and .5% Triamcinolone. By about 3 pm the rash on my legs was mostly gone but left bruising. At 3 am on Wednesday 3/17/2021 I woke up with an extremely itchy neck and face, I went to see what was happening and noticed the same rash from the day prior now on my face and neck. I put the prescribed cream on and took Zyrtec and eventually went back to bed. I woke up at 6:30 am with extremely itchy sides. I went to check on my face and neck, but they were clear, now the rash was all over my shoulders, sides, back, and hips. I felt fine other than the rash, applied the cream and took the meds, and went to work. At work, I started to become itchier on my sides, lower back, and arms. I went to put more cream on and the rash on my stomach was worse as well as my arms were covered. At 1 pm my stomach, back, and sides were less itchy but the outside of my left leg was itchy and started to have the rash again. I went to my physician&#39;s office at 3:30 pm where she said there is nothing else that I can do but go to the ER because I have asthma and I described needing to take more energy to take a deep breath

Within a few hours of getting the shot, the place on my arm where the implant is started burning and was blindingly painful to the touch. It felt like the implant was ripped out then re-inserted and was very tender. Symptoms persisted for 24 hours. I have no pain now. I assume it was from muscular swelling, but I think it is something to be aware of.

I have had horrible hives that are not allowing me to live my life without taking Benadryl around the clock for 6 days so far. I developed a bright red circle on my left arm where I got the vaccine on 6th day of rash. I went to the dermatologist and there was no treatment.  The hives come and go every few hours.

                                                About an hour or hour and half after getting  my vaccine, my head became all fuzzy as though I had just finished drinking three alcoholic drinks. I am not someone that can handle my alcohol very well so by that point I&#39;m really out of it. JUST TO BE CLEAR though I was NOT drinking alcohol. It&#39;s just a metaphor. I could not think clear and was having difficulty communicating beyond simple words. About 30 minutes after this all started, I made the decision to not drive for the rest of the day because I felt my reaction time had decreased substantially.  While all of the head stuff was happening, my arm was also hurting, which I expected. However, the pain didn&#39;t stay localized to my deltoid. Instead it radiated down my arm and into my hand. It felt as though my hand had been stabbed with a knife, so my entire arm hurt but the focal points were in my hand and the injection site. The next day the effects were gone but I had a headache. Not a bad headache but it wasn&#39;t localized to a single part of my head.

                                                Yesterday (March 30th 2021) I noticed that I have developed a rash on my left arm where I got my Covid Shot. It is bright red and itchy. Will be keeping an eye on it and if it gets worse I will go to my local urgent care. I will try to treat it with hydrocortisone cream and see if it gets better.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine I had a sore arm. Within a week I had developed a hard lump under it, and a red ring near the injection site which was hot to the touch and extremely itchy. The rash went away after a few days, but ever since then I&#39;ve suffered from extreme brain fog, dehydration, exhaustion, and just felt overall unwell.

                                                About a week after the vaccine my arm begin to itch super bad.  Which presisted to getting hot, red, hard and swollen which made my arm super sore and very painful.  Over the next few days it grew to about 6&#34; in in length and a raised bump of about 1cm appeared.  I took benedryl and used hydrocortisone cream  and ice packs to help and after about 5 days it finally dimished.

Soreness is also coming back into the arm, and it is only getting worse as time goes on, now almost at the nine day mark.

                                                At about 06:15 PM after receiving the Moderna vaccine, patient left hand (the same arm the shot was given) began to turn blue-grey. The nurses there kept her in a room for about an hour, and monitored her vital signs. Everything seemed to be normal except for the discoloration in the skin. She had trouble breathing and some lightheadedness, but it was ruled to be an anxiety response as everything looked normal. Over the time spent in the clinic, the color began to become less intensely blue and fade back to a normal skin color -- but not completely. At about 7:30 PM, she got up to walk and started feeling pins and needles in her arm and upper chest, but this may be due to anxiety.   The feeling disappeared not long after, and we were able to make it home and eat. Everything else that night went OK, except for the fact that her hand is, at the time of this report, still blue-ish in color.

                                                Nurse hit something in my arm when she gave me the shot, so she had to move it around in my arm in order to make the needle go in deeper. After vaccination, had fever, chills, fatigue for about 24 hours. About two weeks ago (the week of March 29th, 2021), I got an ache in my arm where the needle was injected. This has never happened before. The ache has happened two or three times since my vaccination. If I push on it, there is still soreness in the spot where the needle went into my arm as of today (4/12/2021). The injection spot has been sore ever since I got vaccinated. It does not seem to be going away or getting better. I am going to see my PCP to examine my arm.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had swollen lymph nodes in my arm for the week after my vaccination. A week after my first dose (4/9/21) I started getting a rash at the injection site. It travelled around my arm from the spot where the needle injected me, towards the inside of my arm and down toward my elbow. I have been taking a typical antihistamine from drug store and applying hydrocortisone to the area. It provides a little relief but my arm is still swollen, hot, and itchy.

                                                Around 6:30, I started feeling dizziness and got a severe headache. After waking up from a nap that night around 9, I woke up to a 101.4 fever, itchy throat, dizziness, naseau, and a swollen, red circle around my injection site that was hot to the touch. I couldn&#39;t sleep due to pain and discomfort from my arm and fever. I woke up around 4:30, vomiting. I took Advil and Hydroxizine around 8 am to sleep, but it still didn&#39;t help as I woke up every 30 minutes. I had a fever of 101.3 and these same symptoms the whole day of 4/14. Before going to bed this night, my temperature was down to 100.3. I woke up the next morning (4/15) and my temperature was down to 99.4, so I went to work. I still had the symptoms of itchy throat, dizziness, and weakness. My arm was still swollen and sore too. Another symptom I thought was interesting that I had was waking up drenched in sweat this morning (4/16) and yesterday morning (4/15).  I even woke up through the night to put a fan on me at high speed and took my blankets off, yet still woke up sweating. Tonight, my temperature is back to normal, but I still have an itchy throat, some dizziness, and an itchy injection site.

EMS was called to bring patient to the ER; she was treated with Benadryl which immediately improved the globus sensation and significantly improved the rash. She was then dosed with solu-medrol as well. While at the hospital patient described a slight fullness of tongue and scratchiness of throat; the MD immediately treated with epinephrine and symptoms improved.  Patient was discharged in stable condition later the same night.

                                                It started with a sorr arm and fatigue. The problem began after I was lying down in bed for 1 hr and 1/2. I laid down at 3:30am, but at 5am I was still awake and my left arm felt like it had fallen asleep. The problem was, I could not seem to wake it up. When I turned on my flashlight, I found that nearly all of the veins in my left hand were invisible, actually everything past the elbow on that side. I tried for about 10 mins while lying down to get blood flow back, but nothing was working. My face.felt very warm and the rest of my body felt very cold. When I finally got up to turn on my bedroom light, I found that all of my veins from my chest down were almost entirely invisible as well. I normally have very visible and easy to get blood from veins (except sometimes in my right arm), so this was very worrying to me. I got up and paced a little around my room to try and get blood flowing again, and I felt pretty shaky while doing this. My hands and feet would shake when I held them up. After about 5 minutes, I sat down on my bed because I did not feel well standing anymore, and I waited. Maybe 10 minutes later and things seem to be returning back to normal. I am still very tired but my whole body seems to have blood again. I am also currently on day 3 of my monthly cycle, but this has never happened in relation to that either.

Mild rash has not increased in intensity but has since spread to both forearms, left bicep, back of the neck and jawline. Individual bumps are no more than 2mm in diameter, but form in small clusters of about 10. Cortisone ointment is being used as treatment.

                                                The day after my shot around 11:30 AM I began to feel extremely tired while at work. I felt like I could not concentrate and I felt loopy. I felt like I wanted to lay on the floor and fall asleep. I went home around 12:15 and slept from 1pm to 5 am. The next day I felt out of it.  The day after my shot I had a large red lump on my arm in the area where I got my vaccine and it was very sore. This lasted a few days and the pain and redness went away.  Yesterday, 4/19/21, I woke up with a large red swollen circle around the injection site. It itches very bad and burns. The skin is very hot. Today on 4/20/21 a red ring appeared around the red circle. It is still very itchy and burning. The skin in this area is very hot. Only ice has helped with the pain.

                                                Following the first dose, I was referred for an EKG by my primary physician. My heartbeat was irregular and the doctors said it was probably from the vaccination. I had severe arm pain and flu-like symptoms. Dose 2, I had intense lymph node swelling and pain of vaccination site, a three-day continuous fever between 99 and 102 degrees, no sleep and horrible body/head pain.

                                                14 hours after my second dose I became nauseous and threw up yellow bile intermittently (about 5 separate times, each retching fit lasting 5 minutes) until 12:30pm. My primary care physician prescribed Zofran helped curb the vomiting. I also had a fever of 103.1 for half an hour before it subsided to 100, body aches, sweating, chills, headache, and nausea. Today, 4/28 over 24 hours after my vaccine, I started presenting a swelling on my right hand that is itchy and discolored, although the side effects from the day before have lessened to a certain degree.

These spells lasted for a couple of hours but after a few days became more chronic and was matched with fatigue, tightness of chest, headaches, and brain fog.  Impaired ability to complete every day tasks. Began presenting with capilliarities in mid April, along with easy bruising/bleeding and elevated liver enzymes (the enzymes began to stabilize over the following week).  All of these symptoms have persisted (currently May 4th).

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

These symptoms lasted a frightening 10 or so minutes leaving behind the bodily aches.

Have been vomiting now for more or less 10minutes (all of what I ate during dinner).   Other symptoms include slight headache, feeling slightly warm although I have not checked my temperature and also at the same time slightly cold, and pain in the right arm.   On the previous dose the only symptom I had was pain in my left arm (I switched sides this time around although don?t think that is relevant)

My Primary Dr. told me to take Benadryl and to keep him abreast if any other symptoms started to appear. I don&#39;t do well with needles and became really light-headed (Fire Dept. took me into another room and provided me with water while allowing me to sit there for a while until I was better). Every now and then I randomly breakout randomly with rashes that appear where the rash was before on my arm, chest, and back when I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine.

The patient also noted &#34;tingling&#34; in her right arm where she received the vaccine.  In addition, there was localized erythema at the injection site with about 5 cm in diameter.  I gave the patient 37 mg of Benadryl and the edema immediately was reduced in addition to the erythema resolved.  She had no more tingling.  I observed her for 30 minutes and all was fine with the patient.  I then checked on her 1 hour later and all was good.

                                                About 5:45 pm on Saturday, January 2, 2021 my inner left eye began to feel itchy and irritated like there was something in it. I touched my eye and rubbed it for approximately 30 minutes, but it still felt like I had something poking my inner eyelid. I looked in the mirror and saw my inner, upper, left eyelid was swollen and slowly getting worse. I tried applying a warm compress for 10 minutes, but it did not seem to help. I was getting ready for a shower and saw hives on my hips and inner thighs. I felt itchy in other places of my body as well. I saw hives on both of my upper arms, my back, and my neck. I took one 25 mg Benadryl and got in the shower. As I was showering, I felt my left upper lip begin to tingle and swell. I rushed to the ER immediately. I arrived around 7:25 pm. As I was waiting for the ER doctor, I noticed my lip and eye swelling were almost back to normal, but I still had hives and they were spreading. The ER doctor gave me Benedryl and Solumedrol in an IV around 9 pm. I left the ER around 10 pm. I had no more swelling on my eye and lip and my hives were slowly diminishing.

                                                Moderna vaccine received on 12/21 from my workplace. Rash (reddened skin not raised) appeared after vaccine was given (within 24hrs) the size of a quarter and was gone 3 days later.  Now on 1/3 the rash (red bullseye not raised) came back the size of a baseball and is warm to the touch. Went to urgent care and physician called it a delayed adverse reaction to the moderna vaccine 1st dose

                                                I woke up and my shoulder was very itchy. I looked under my sleeve and there was a rash. The itchiness and rash are new today, however a lump has been present since injection. The rash is directly above the lump. It may be unrelated, but I&#39;ve also been unusually drowsy (noticed before taking the benedryl).  I took benedryl and applied lotion to the rash. My pregnancy began July 4th and I was 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the vaccine. My estimated due date is March 25th, 2021. At the time of the adverse reaction, I am 29 weeks pregnant.

Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

The following day, the lump was still there, it was red and hot, but not painful. The redness had spread towards my chest but did not go past my armpit. The size of the lump has decreased since then, nearly gone today on 01/07/2021.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                I had head pressure that felt like a headache In my temples and the back of my skull around 9-10 hours after the vaccine. Left arm pain starting about 11 hours after shot. Difficult to move arm without intense pain and intense pain at the slightest touch of the arm on or around the vaccination spot. Starting the morning after the vaccination, my glands in my neck were tender and aching like they do when I?m fighting off a cold, I had body aches that you would get if you had a fever for the entire day all over my body. I took ibuprofen that night and they started to go away and I felt hot like I was breaking a fever. I woke up the next morning which is 2 days after the vaccination and felt completely back to normal besides residual arm pain. This pain is bearable and I can move my arm with only a dull pain and I can touch the spot without intense pain however it is still painful.

Took 1 Aleve for the pain. Then on day 7 axillary pain went away and a rash started to form on arm where vaccine was given. Day 8 rash spread at was bright red. Around noon on day 8  hives popped up next to left eye. On day 8 did a virtual doctor appointment and the NP prescribed antibiotics because she said the &#34;rash&#34; is cellulitis.  At this time took zytec to help with the hives.

                                                On 1/4/2020 at roughly 07:00 PM, a dull ache started in my right arm where the vaccine was injected, it radiated from my right shoulder, to my right shoulder blade. My arm felt very heavy. There was also a small hard lump beginning to form with a little heat at the injection site. I had difficulty sleeping due to the aching pain. On 1/5/2020, I woke up at 06:30 AM, the lump had grown in size, and was much more red and hot to the touch, in an oval shape. By roughly 11:30 AM same day, it began to itch, I had checked it and the lump had raised significantly. Hot to the touch. The dull ache had begun radiating into my right armpit as well as down to my right elbow. By 06:00 PM, same day, the aching had continued,  the lump was still very raised, itchy, red, and hot. It looked like a large hive. By 06:30 AM on 1/6/2020, the dull ache had mostly subsided, my shoulder blade still felt uncomfortable. The itching continued. The redness spread in size, however the swelling of the lump had gone down slightly. By 06:30 AM on 1/7/2020, the lump had mostly gone down in size significantly, the dull ache had subsided completely, the redness had gone away. By 1/8/2020, 10:00 PM, the lump and swelling are gone, no ache, no itch, still a slight discoloration where lump was.

She contacted her PCP who told her to seek evaluation at the urgent care. She went to the urgent care on 01/05/21 and was tested for COVID (negative) and was given an Rx for steroid cream. CG called me back on 01/07/21 stating that she now has developed a &#34;circular rash&#34; around her injection site, which her PCP was able to assess. The CG reports that her PCP told her she is ok to receive the second dose, but with close monitoring and to pre-medicate with Benadryl.

I have been taking photos and making the site.  The area inside the ring is warmer compared to my other deltoid on the right side. I am schedule for the next vaccine on the 1/26/21.  I just wanted to make sure I would still qualify to get the second dose/ safe? I can send pictures as well. I just wasn&#39;t able to attach an image.

                                                Around 9:00-9:30pm on Jan 16th (vaccination date of Jan 8th), I noticed my arm in the area of the injection site had swelled, turned red/pink, and felt itchy. Area is approximately 8mm in length and 4-6mm in height, irregular shape. Area feels tight, hard, and significantly warmer than remainder of arm. No fever, but site registers approximately 98F, which is above forehead temperature. Given my history of delayed reactions to insect bites, I felt reporting may be necessary. No medical treatment sought as of 10:05pm on Sat Jan 16th, but I will call primary care provider/urgent care center if symptoms worsen or if taking over the counter loratidine 10mg does not improve swelling, itching, and redness.

                                                I received the dose at 1:45 pm on 1/13/2021 at Medical Center. Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

Now on 01/16/2021, I started getting a cough, a sore throat, a  fever, and extremely tired. Then the next day the symptoms got worse and now I had a stuffy nose, inner ear pain, nausea, muscle aches all over my body, dizzyness, and chills. This continued into Sunday and now Monday.

At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                Immediately following the vaccine there was nausea after eating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain which lasted about 8 days. 9 days after receiving the vaccine the injection site area got itchy, hot and swollen. Redness appeared about an hour after icing the area down. Benadryl was taken within 30 minutes of symptoms starting and swelling did go down moderately, but redness and heat from area remained. Today being day 10 after the vaccine, the redness, swelling, hot temperature and itching are still present. The area is about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide. Redness is in the shape of a ring with the center of the swelling area being white and the outer edges being red. None of the symptoms have worsened since day 9 and self care with Benadryl and icing is being continued.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, I had redness around the injection site and a sore arm for about 2-3 days. I received the shot on a Tuesday, and by the weekend my arm felt fine. One week later (Monday 25th), I felt like I had a light fever. My temperature was 99.1F. Tuesday, my left arm where I received the injection was SO SUPER itchy. When I looked at it, there was a huge, red, swollen, bump. The area was about the size of a credit card. The area was also HOT to the touch even though the rest of my arm felt like a normal temperature. From Tuesday 26th through Wednesday 27th (time of reporting), I still have the big, red, hot bump at the injection site, and my fever fluctuates in between 99.1-100.4F. I contacted my doctor who believes it is most likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He has advised me to take benadryl and tylenol, and if I still have the fever tomorrow, he will test me for strep, flu, and COVID. I have not taken the benadryl and tylenol long enough to see if there is any sort of impact. I should also mention that I get tested weekly for COVID at work, and my test from Monday January 25 has come back as negative.

                                                Approximately 9 days following vaccine administration  raised red,  itchy  bumps appeared on the backs of hands, wrists, and elbows. The following day my fingers were sore. Three hours later red bumps erupted on my fingers and palms. Three days following the initial bumps, more bumps appeared on the bottom and tops of toes. Hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl provide minimal relief. The bumps continue to appear 16 days following  administration. The bumps are comparable to the bumps I experience when taking amoxicillin following Epstein Barr virus.

Approximately one week after the vaccine, I developed hives at injection site. Hives turned into another welt that continued to spread until I was given steroids to take. The steroids did cause the reaction to stop and go away.

At about 30 minutes post injection, she stated she had small bumps on her bilateral arms. They were hard for me to discern but she also claimed the bumps were painful.  I asked about any labored breathing or chest tightening and she denied both. After about ~45-50, she still stated the same itchiness and pain. Visually there was no change in my opinion. Patient then conferred with  supervisors at her employment about her next steps. Her PCP was closed and she was deciding if she wanted to go to urgent care. That&#39;s the last interaction I had.

Rash is hot to touch, but not raised. Started 24 hours ago and is continuing with these symptoms. Nothing notable  occurred before pain and rash came on.  Taking NSAIDs for pain and will be taking Benadryl at night in hopes of clearing up the rash.

I have photo documentation of size and location.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

                                                Starting 3 days ago (approximately 10 days after vaccine) I started having muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was given in similar to the soreness right after the vaccine was given.  A few hours after the soreness was noticed I noticed red-raised hives in the injection site. Over all symptoms (soreness to touch same as the soreness right after vaccine was given, itching, redness, raised hives, and warm to touch in the area of redness). The next day the symptoms remained about the same but area of raised-red-hives now seems to be a more defined 4-5 inch long red oval in the area the vaccine was given. 3rd day redness seemed lighter in color but still a pretty defined oval with warmness to touch the soreness was a little better by the 3rd day. I started taking Amoxicillin 500 mg that I had at home on the 3rd day. Today, 4th day, overall seems to be getting better still some soreness, still a red oval but is getting lighter, still soreness but defiantly better than it was. My doctor had me start Keflex 500 mg Q 6 hours for 7 days I started taking that today.

                                                Sudden swelling and redness around injection site. Initial swelling/redness had subsided significantly, then I woke up to a very painful swelling/redness. The swelling/redness was approximately 4 inches wide &amp; 4 inches tall - expanding from the injection site. This lasted from Jan. 20th-Jan. 24th then subsided suddenly. As of Jan. 25th, the swelling/redness is gone. I did not seek treatment for this.

After 2-3 days, the left arm swelling around the injection site is still a bit red and swollen but the itch has gone done. However, I then broke out in hives! Currently taking Zyrtec to see if the hives go away - bumps all over arms, legs, back - itchy! Hives has been happening for 1-2 days so far.

                                                Moderate pain in injection site for first two days (02/02/2021, 02/03/2021). Nausea, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat, low-grade fever (~99°F) and persistent headache, and took Theraflu nighttime before bed on day two (02/03/2021). Temperature of 99.7°F throughout day three (02/04/2021); also, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat with swollen lymph nodes and tonsils with white spots (did at-home test for strep-A, got a negative result), and persistent headache?this night I also took Theraflu nighttime. Day 4 (02/05/2021), I woke up around 7AM  with severe nausea and went back to sleep after having ginger ale; throughout the early afternoon I had mild lower back and knee pain, same throat and tonsil situation, mild headache, and diarrhea. I ended up drinking a lot of water and had a glass of emergen-c as well as taking two pepto bismol tablets. Less than an hour later, I threw up everything I?d consumed throughout the day (water, hot tea, and emergen-c, no food due to nausea). Tried eating plain white rice and drinking  beer that evening but I couldn?t keep it down. Day 5 (today, 02/06/2022), I woke up with only lower back pain, same tonsil/throat situation, headache, and a slightly higher fever- 100.2°F. So far no nausea.

                                                After 1st shot on 01/09/21, I only had pain at the injection site. This lasted almost 3 full days. After 2nd shot on 02/06/21, I had most symptoms listed. I got the 2nd dose at 9:03am and once I woke up from a nap at 1pm, most of the side effects had already started. I had severe pain at the injection site where I was unable to dress myself or do normal activities, severe muscle pain and soreness, severe chills, a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a mild headache, severe dehydration that remained throughout the day and night even though I drank almost 2 gallons of water, stomach pain and bloating, and nausea and vomiting that occurred in the middle of the night at 2am, and extreme fatigue. Even though I had fatigue, I was unable to sleep due to the pain. I finally took pain medicine at 8am on 2/07/21 to help myself go to sleep as well since I was awake for over 24 hours. I slept for 6 hours and woke up still having chills, muscle soreness, a slight fever, a mild headache, and pain at the injection site where I am still unable to lift my left arm and put clothes on.

The majority of these symptoms started around 12 hours after the vaccination, with fever, chills, headache and dizziness being the most prominent. Ibuprofen (200mg) was taken about 18 hours in (as was advised to only take within the first 24 hours). Most of the symptoms are gone now after 24 hours of vaccination and taking ibuprofen. While most other symptoms are gone, there is still continued fatigue, and slight headache and nausea.

At 12pm, small wave of nausea and abdominal discomfort that lasted for about 20-30 minutes. Stayed in bed and intermittently slept until 12pm when nausea started. Once nausea passed around 12:30 PM, took a singular Advil pill and returned to bed. Awoke a little after 2:00 PM and most of the aches in legs were gone, continued to stay in bed but did not sleep. Finally cooled down at 3:00 PM and checked temperature was normal again (97.8 °F). Arm was normal temperature at 3 PM as well, stiffness did not go away until 1/31/21.

Within 24 hours of those symptoms they subsided with Tylenol/Ibuprofen. On day 8 following the shot, I began to have an itchy sensation at the injection site. Within hours the injection site began to swell to a raised lime size knot on my skin, which continued to itch, was red, warm, and the raised skin had a few bumps on it. Again I used Ibuprofen/Tylenol and the swelling, redness, and itchiness decreased within 24 hours.

For unknown reason the patient arrived to vaccine clinic on 2/9/21 without allergy skin testing or follow up. She reportedly told them that she was &#34;&#34;cleared by Occ health&#34;&#34; after her first reaction and the administering RN said that there was no flag on her chart so she was given the vaccine.  Unfortunately, immediately after she got it, she developed throat tightening and got zyrtec. The reaction progressed very quickly (minutes) to diaphoresis, panic, grabbing at throat saying she was suffocating, nausea, and difficulty verbalizing. She was diffusely red but no hives. They couldn&#39;t get a BP and O2 sat and temp were normal but they put her on a non-rebreather and gave her Epi. Rapid response was called and she was taken to the ED.

                                                I am almost a licensed pharmacist so I am aware of what was going on with my body* I started with a sore arm and fatigue on the day of vaccination. The following morning I woke up and got dressed and used the restroom. I proceeded downstairs to make my coffee.  As I was doing so I became dizzy and nauseous. I sat down on the floor and then I lost my vision and hearing. I broke out in a profuse sweat and had no concept of time. My boyfriend was with me and said it took 5-10 minutes before I began to normalize. I apparently had shallow breathing and turned pale white including my lips, I slowly regained awareness although I never fully lost consciousness. 911 was called and paramedics arrived. by this time I had begun to normalize with most of my vision returning. I ended up declining to see medical attention because I normalized and told the paramedics I would seek attention if it came back.  * please note the physician listed is my PCP but I was not seen for this reaction.

By 9:30 am visible hives were seen on my neck, chest, and upper back; a generic Zyrtec was taken which helped relieve itchiness. By 2:00 pm the itchiness came back. I followed up with a health professional in person at 6:20 pm. Itchiness was still present. The hives were reduced but still visible.

It is a few inches long/wide. The only side effects I had after the shot was a sore arm for 2 days, until last night/today (1 week later).

I wanted to report this so that it is known that this can be a prolonged side effect.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I was in the shower at 5:45pm when my left arm began to itch.  I scratched my arm a few times.  Then, I looked at my arm and noticed that it was red.  There was a red area in the exact place where I received my Covid vaccination 8 days earlier.  There were also red scratch marks from where I itched the site.  A few minutes later, the itching had subsided, but the red mark was still visible.  I got out of the shower and took pictures of this mark.  The mark was on my left arm, where I received my Covid vaccination, and was in the shape of a defined square/oval.  At the time of this report, it has been approximately 3 hours since I first noticed this reaction.  At this time, the red mark is still visible, but the it does not itch.  The red mark on my arm looks similar to images of &#34;Covid Arm&#34; I have seen reported online.  Additionally, a few days (1-3 days) before this reaction, I had the feeling of discomfort in my left armpit.  From my personal experience, this feeling was consistent with the feeling of a swollen lymph node under my armpit area.  I felt this feeling for approximately 1 day total.  I thought nothing of the discomfort at the time.  The uncomfortable feeling in my armpit subsided approximately 1-2 days before the skin reaction on my arm occurred.  I do not know if these events are related, but they occurred in the same arm (left arm) where I received my Covid vaccination.

Saturday evening or Sunday morning I noticed red splotches along my torso. Sunday they began to itch and I still have them along my neck, back, upper and lower torso, and a few on my legs. I haven?t changed any environmental factors (no new lotions, creams, hair products, diet, or perfumes). Today I used Benadryl cream, but in the past I?ve been putting my regular, non-scented Aveno lotion and coconut oil.

Over the next few days, I became incredibly itchy and developed a rash on both of my arms. I now have what I think is considered, &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. There is a red circle around the injection site that is swollen, red, and tender. I then noticed the inside of my mouth was sore and I had blisters developing on the roof of my mouth near my gums. My throat is super sore and swollen and has a yellow pocket on the back of my throat. I am also having body aches under my arms near my ribs and back.

Patient received vaccine at approximately 10:20 am on 2/26/21.  She reports that a few minutes after receiving vaccine that her throat felt really dry.  It felt &#39;like when you wake up from anesthesia&#39;.  She had no breathing problems so she didn&#39;t think much of it.  About an hour after receiving vaccine,  she went through a drive thru to order food and &#39;wasn&#39;t thinking right, like I had brain fog&#39;.  That lasted a short time.  About an hour after receiving vaccine, patient noticed lips and mouth were tingling &#39;like I had ate something really spicy&#39;.  This lasted off an on for about an hour.  Later that evening, patient felt dizzy and nauseated.  She laid down and took a nap and woke up feeling better.  Skin started to feel itchy that night.  On 2/27/21, patient woke up with an itchy rash all over back.  Rash is still there.  No other symptoms at this time.

                                                It?s been a week since receiving my vaccination and yesterday mid afternoon my arm began to itch. I began scratching and when I realized it was my shot I immediately stopped. I then researched to see if this was a symptom and from what I saw it was. I didn?t feel comfortable taking any medication so I just put ice on the  shot spot. The strength of the itch would vary and at times the spot would get very hot. Towards the end of the night, my whole body began to get hot so I took a shower. The shower extremely helped. I was also able to sleep without the need to itch. It?s now the next morning and the itch is slightly there, but not completely

                                                Fever, headache, itching, hives appearing, and swelling of the eyes. Almost all lasted about a day. The hives and itching lasted about 3 days.  I took some ibuprofen and it did not do much to help. The best remedy was getting lots of rest.

                                                About 2 weeks after getting the first vaccine shot, the skin on my index finger of my right hand was extremely itchy. I scratched it and thought it was a bite or something. The itchy rash is all over my right hand, one spot on my left hand, and on both of my feet. While I was looking up what the rash could be, nothing really resembled the rash. Then today I saw articles about ?COVID toe?. This COVID toe rash matches my rash exactly by look and feel. I was worried I had COVID so I got a rapid test today. The results came up negative but I did have the antibodies. I believe I got this ?COVID toe? rash from the vaccine. The rash red raised patches with some purple and it is very itchy and has a burning sensation.

Rash developed on the injection site 7 days after 1st dose of Moderna. I had gone swimming the day the redness began which may have triggered the response. Additional small rashes arose on my forearm but quickly subsided with cortisone cream. However, rash on the injection site persists despite the use of hydrocortisone cream.  Redness and warmth persist. Doctor has prescribed antibiotics in case of skin infection and zyrtec.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

The symptoms did not go away or worsen so she left when released.  Around 7 the symptoms had progressed to tongue feeling heavy, sore throat, and some difficulty breathing (although her O2 fluctuated between 96-99).  She went to the ER, they administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroids.  Within a couple hours the symptoms had subsided.  As directed, we continued Benadryl and Pepcid for 24 hours.  After being off the Benadryl and Pepcid for 12 -15 hours the symptoms returned, she took one dose of both and now seems to be fine.

Arm was very sore, hot to the touch, and swollen for nearly 3 weeks following the injection.  Second shot on 3/5 R arm, also developed a small red rash but was smaller and went away within a week. Within 24 hours of getting the vaccine, a high fever developed, fatigue, weakness, nausea, pain throughout my body, and migraines.

                                                Injection site pain, headache, and muscle pain. Muscle pain was mainly in the shoulders (more on the side of the injection), lower back, and in the legs. Lasted through the night and took a Tylenol 500mg tablet that next morning (3/18). Symptoms improved slightly, but did not got away and got a little worse as the day progressed (but still improved from the morning). Took another Tylenol that evening, felt better by bedtime, and feel much better today (3/19). Still have some arm soreness when I lift the arm my injection was placed in, but not too bad.

The headache became a severe migraine and extreme body aches. Symptoms are somewhat relieved today, but are still bothersome to the point of having to miss a day of work.

It is the second day and it is still red. I have no redness where the covid vaccine was administered, just redness where the scar from my bcg shot is. Is this sone kind of reaction?

It just showed up today (3/27/2021), even though I got the vaccine on 3/19/2021.  The lump is hard and swollen,  and looks and feels similarly to the reaction I get when I get a mosquito bite, I.e. hard, swollen, itchy, and red.

                                                The night of my vaccine, I had a 100 degree fever, body aches, and chills.  That was resolved by the next day.  On 3/29, I woke up with itchiness behind my right ear.  around 4:30pm on the same day, I had broken out into hives on my face and arms.  By 5:30 they had become itchy and had spread to my neck and chest area.  I had also developed swelling around my eyes, above and below them.  I woke up at 1:30am on 3/30 with itching and burning and more swelling around my eyes.  At 7:30am on 3/30,  my eyes were almost swollen shut and I sought medical attention.  I had itching and burning on my entire body, swollen eyes, full body aches, and joint pain.  I was prescribed steroids and began that course around 1:30pm.  I was also prescribed two epi pens.  Around 6:30pm that night, I had a 100.7 degree fever.  It dropped without the use of a fever reducer within the next two hours. The swelling reduced around my face by 8pm.  This morning, I had almost no swelling, but still a full body rash.  I am treating it with benadryl, zyrtec and maximum strength pepcid, steroids, and calamine lotion.

I am now on day 3 after the injection and can barely stay awake. All symptoms other than nausea have subsided. I am trying to maintain normal daily activities, but I took a 3-hour nap today, tried to go to the gym later and almost fell asleep on the treadmill.

On Thursday the 1st (one week after shot) it started itching again and I noticed there were some small red hives on left arm near injection site. The next morning my whole shoulder/bicep (injection site) area looked like a large mosquito bite. Very swollen, red and itchy. Now a whole day later, my arm is still swollen, red and itchy. But I am getting hives on both hands, elbows and feet.

                                                Fatigue on 4/1/21 that became very noticeable around 2:45 pm. General muscle soreness/aches on 4/1/21 and a bit on 4/2/21. Left shoulder sore and uncomfortable to move through full range of movement from 4/1/21 afternoon until afternoon of 4/3/21. Soreness did noticeable die down as time passed.  Discomfort/muscle tightness starting around 3:00 pm 4/6/21 in the left axillary region. No swelling/redness/rash visible on surface. Discomfort most noticeable when stretching arm forwards/backwards or squeezing upper arm against side. Squeezing arm to side results in a feeling similar to if someone were trying to hold a marble in their armpit.   4/8/21 woke up still with arm pit discomfort and a return of the discomfort in the out shoulder muscle where the vaccine was administered.

She stirred several times and seemed to wake but then would faint again. She finally regained consciousness and stated she felt okay. I put cold compress on the back of her neck and on her forehead. We had someone move a fan to blow cooler air into the area. Also removed her mask to make sure she was breathing and airway was open. We had her stay an extra 30 minutes for observation. I later called to patient and she stated she felt fine with the exception of a sore arm from the injection.

Then within the next minute felt hot/sweats and her face/chest/neck started to turn red. She also felt the sensation of her throat closing and couldn&#39;t breath so she took off her mask. Within the next minute, all symptoms subsided. Patient stayed at the pharmacy for thirty minutes for extra observation. Manifested no additional or worsening symptoms so she went home and 8 hours after felt flu like symptoms for 79 hours.

                                                Within 30 seconds of the injection of my second dose of Moderna, I experienced extreme nausea unlike any that I have experienced before. Within 1 minute of the injection, my face, arms, chest, and neck flushed and I turned completely red. I felt hot and started to sweat. At the same time, I began having trouble breathing with the sensation that my throat was beginning to close. My eyes filled with tears and I was not able to talk to communicate what was happening. My mom, who was with me at the time of vaccination, asked the administering pharmacist if I could remove my mask because I was having trouble breathing. Throughout this reaction, the pharmacist froze and was visibly in shock of what was happening. Because of this, my mom began asking me questions to figure out what else I was experiencing. Once I was able to remove the mask and breathe deeply, the reaction subsided after two minutes. The pharmacist, after my reaction began to subside, stated that they had an epipen ready to administer if needed. I was never administered the epipen. The pharmacist asked me to wait 30 minutes instead of the general 15 minutes before leaving the site. Because the symptoms went away and did not return within the 30 minutes, I left the site. After the vaccination, I experienced a low-grade fever for 79 hours, chills, a headache, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue. After realizing my reaction was not considered ?normal,? I began to research and realized these symptoms align with anaphylaxis, even though they subsided quickly after experiencing them.

Very tired throughout day, headache lasted most of day. Tried to get out of bed to do laundry but was too lightheaded to finish and had to go sit down. Cold pack on forehead was only treatment I used. The next day fever was gone but still very tired - tried to go outside for a walk but turned around quickly due to nausea / tiredness. Back at work on day 3 and feeling totally fine.

                                                My arm was sore for only a day after receiving the vaccine. But then the area on my arm near the injection site started to itch, and a small mosquito bite-like hive was forming.  Today, 4/14, the hive has grown to about a 2 inch x 1 inch oval. It is slightly raised, slightly red in color,  warm to the touch and occasionally itchy.   I have not attempted to treat it in any way as it is not much of a nuisance however I still wanted to report.

                                                Onset of pretty severe neck and upper back pain that made it difficult to sleep because I was unable to find a position that didn&#39;t cause any pain about 12 hours after injection (inj: 12:45 pm on 4/16/21; onset: 12:30 am on 4/17/21). Saturday, 4/17/21, the pain lessened and I just felt a bit of fatigue and injection site pain. Sunday night (4/18/21) going into Monday morning (4/19/21) I was woken up from my sleep with very severe upper neck pain that radiated down the R-side of my back, on the muscle. I could not fall back asleep for 2 hours because any position I was in I experienced intense pain. Today, 4/19/21, during the day, the pain is definitely less severe. I took my meloxicam this morning as I usually do but it was still pretty bad pain so I rubbed CBD cream on it. Pain still feels dull but tense, with occasional flare-ups of sharp pain. Today it is more widespread, across my shoulders and in the bilateral upper back area. When I rubbed the CBD cream on it, it hurt to touch. I also take gabapentin at night, which is my standard for my fibromyalgia, and I&#39;m not sure if that is what is exacerbating this pain, seeing as it is so much worse at night. I have never woken up from pain before like I did last night, and I deal with pain daily with fibromyalgia. It was very intense.

I followed up with my primary care physician who diagnosed me with Shingles. Stating it could have been a correlation to the vaccine that compromised my immune system. I am on methyllpredinsone  and valacyclovir HCL.

                                                Several days after recieving my Moderna vaccine, I began to feel itchiness in my feet. Within a few hours, the itchiness spread to my hands (both the tops of my hands and my palms). The itchiness spread to my wrists as well. By the morning of April 17th, I had swollen, red hives on my hands, wrists and feet. The itching was coupled with a burning feeling. Benadryl and Calamine lotion did not help. As the day continued, the hives spread to my ankles, knees and elbows. In the morning on Monday, April 19th I felt stiff (didn&#39;t know this was part of my reaction until my doctor asked me if I felt like my joints were stiff--I was too itchy to feel concerned about it), the bottoms of my feet were painful, and I could barely touch anything with my hands without it hurting. As the day continued, I became so uncomfortable between the itchiness and burning I decided to see my doctor.

Red, blotchy, itchy hives. This covers ears, neck, arms, hands, back, stomach, and legs. I have been able to treat at home using Benadryl, Calamine, and Cortizone. I don&#39;t think I need to be seen because the OTC products are helping, but I wanted to make this known since the vaccine is still so new. &#34;

                                                Had my shot at noon on 4/19, and around midnight or shortly after (at 1am-ish on 4/20) I had really terrible chills and was shaking, but my forehead felt hot, I felt quite nauseous, and I had a headache. I got out of bed and took my temperature using a thermometer and it was 100.6 degrees. Continued to feel bad until falling asleep around 3am, woke back up at 6am and took my temperature again and it was still feverish at 99.8 degrees. Woke up once more briefly at 11am but did not take temperature and fell back asleep. Finally woke up for the day at 3pm and fever had broken, temp was back down to normal at 98.5. Still felt a little nauseous but that was probably more from not having eaten all day! Now as of 4/21 I am back to normal. (If it helps for further info, I have also not to my knowledge contracted Covid before, and I had no adverse effects other than a very sore arm from my first shot. The second shot my arm was less sore but of course I was distracted by being actually sick. Also possible data to note is that the second shot felt like it hurt less and I got an unusual new bandaid type the pharmacist called an inject safe barrier bandage.)

                                                After the first dose (end of March), I had a large red rash at the injection site which lasted almost two weeks.  After my second dose (April 20), I had an intense reaction. I was up most of the night freezing cold, leg hair standing on end, and body aching. Had to take a hot shower to cope with the chills. I finally fell asleep for two hours and woke up in hot sweats and an intense headache. I was fine by the afternoon, but developed a new and unusual symptom around 1pm -- sharp localized pains that would intermittently shoot through random parts of my body (mostly legs, but also arms and midsection). They were so bad I would keel over while standing and gasp. Each day since, they have lessened in intensity, but are still somewhat present (it is 11pm on April 26, one week later). Now, I have what I would describe as subtle, localized cramps (?) in random areas (calves, thigh, tricep, back) that come and go -- more of an ache-y sensation but widespread across my body. It is nothing I have experienced before, and only started after the vaccination.

                                                About one week after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of enlarged cervical LN, sinus pressure, fevers. This progressed to develop rash and eventually SIRS. She was admitted several times over the course of April and May to determine a diagnosis and had extensive workup for infectious, autoimmune and hematologic malignancy. The ultimate diagnosis was macrophage activation syndrome/HLH but it is unclear if this was triggered by the COVID vaccine or not.  She is responding to steroids in taper and Anakinra and still recovering in the hospital at this point.

                                                Initially had a very sore arm then during the night I woke up with hives all over my body. They were very itchy and red. I went to the medical clinic on Monday and attempted to use Pepcid, allegra, and Benadryl. That did not work so the following week I went and was prescribed an oral steroid, prednisone 10 mg Tabs pack 48s. During the course of the steroid the hives went away. Then after the steroid ended heartburn arose and the hives returned again all over my body and they also were on my lips. Went to the medical clinic again and the hives were combined with &#39;moderna arm&#39; however the moderna arm arose throughout my body and has consistently shown up since. Went to an allergist and was also placed on montelukast 10mg tablets. The hives continued, Benadryl, 24hr allegra, and 24 Zyrtec were used to lessen it but did not work. Now I have to take the biologic Zolair to take care of the hives and if I do not take the shot they come back every 4 weeks. The &#39;moderna arm&#39; rash has shown up consistently on both of my hands every morning then goes away later in the day.

                                                Within a minute of administering the vaccine, the patient felt her arm where the injection was administered go numb. She also felt sporadic muscle spasms going down her feet. She said she started to feel dizzy, so we laid her down on the floor with her 2 feet up on a chair. She laid there for few minutes after which she said she felt better. She sat up on the floor and her B.P reading was taken. Her B.P reading read 88/68 mmHg. On further investigation she stated that she has a history of anemia, but hasn&#39;t been to a doctor in a few years. On the floor (concrete), her body started to shiver, so we moved her to a chair and she was given water to drink and a granola bar to eat. She was also given a blanket and some hot chocolate to drink. 15 minutes later, her B.P reading was checked again and it was 111/78mmHg. We monitored her for 30-40 minutes and after she felt back to normal she was asked to take some rest at home and follow up with a physician to make sure her Hemoglobin levels.

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

There was alot of pain to site and some itching late the same day. Went to urgent care to have arm looked at since rash looked bigger on 12/30/20. PA took a look and diagnosed me with &#34;cellulitis of left upper limb&#34; and &#34;adverse effect of other viral vaccine, initial encounter&#34;. She prescribed Keflex 500mg and Cetirizine 10mg treating it as an infection. Redness went away on 1/3/21

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                Rash. Large teardrop shape, red and risen up from the skin around the injection site. If I touch it, I notice that it?s itchy. Just noticed it this morning after showering, can?t think of any other reason for it to be there and there?s not any rashes elsewhere on my body. Currently icing it.

                                                On the morning of 1/8/2021 (exactly 6 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine), I woke up with large hives concentrated mostly on my upper body (face, neck, chest, stomach). I tried taking various antihistamines (excluding Benadryl, which would later prove effective) to combat the hives, but they were largely ineffective. The hives shifted throughout the day, starting in my upper body and working their way down to my lower extremities. The next day, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I woke up with worse hives (now all over my body, mostly concentrated on my stomach, hips, and legs) and angioedema in my face. At this point, I went to the hospital and received a course of IV fluids/steroids/Benadryl/anti-nausea medication and all symptoms subsisted. Symptoms returned a few hours after discharge, where I continued an oral regimen of the aforementioned medications. The next day, 8 days after the initial dose, my symptoms were equally severe and coupled with gastrointestinal distress, feverishness (likely due to dehydration from the Benadryl) and nausea. This morning (1/11/2021), 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my hives have largely subsisted. In summation, starting 6 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced 3 full days and nights of severe hives and swelling.

                                                Passed out twice; Pain in the injection site; Slight headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 24-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced the events, passed out twice, pain in the injection site, and slight headache.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. No concomitant medications were reported.   On 26 Dec 2020 at 1:58 pm, approximately three hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L2DA) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Dec 2020, at 5:00 pm, the patient passed out. She also had pain in the injection site and a slight headache.   On 27 Dec 2020, at 8:30 am, the patient passed out again. No treatment information was provided.  The Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome for the events, passed out twice, pain in the injection site, and slight headache was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 24 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness and non-serious expected event of injection site pain and headache. The event occurred apparently few hours after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 026L2DA) administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On 12-27-2020 I continued with rash and then the rash started to spread to my entire back. On 12-28-2020, the rash was still present to my back and it radiated down both my legs and since then the rash has gotten worse. I was treated with steroids and histamines at the hospital.

                                                Almost 48 hours after the vaccine I woke up with hives flush to my skin along my R&amp;L arms, under my arms, on my left hand, insides of both thighs, and around my ankles. My skin felt hot but minimally itchy. The insides of my hands and burn when I wash them and they feel really sore. The bottoms of my feet also felt like they were burning when I took a shower. Nothing in my diet or hygiene products have changes. I took a half dose of Benadryl at 11am today and the hives are still there along with the pain in my hands when washing them. I coordinated with my PCP and they recommended self monitoring and Benadryl.

The following day, arm pain was increased  preventing movement of above shoulder, but not preventing  daily actives and not pain medication used. Skin raised around injection sight. Throughout that day increased tiredness and  fatigue was experienced but did not prevent from completing work at  the office. Two days after injection, arm pain remained the same as the day before and some tiredness experienced.  Skin red and raised in a 2in radius around injection site. Third day after injection, arm pain reduced, redness gone away.  No pain by the fifth day.  7 days after injection, skin is still raised around injection site, redness returned and is now itchy, and increased tiredness.

Hurt to raise above my shoulder. This went on till about 1/9/21. Then it went away nothing at my infection site then it came back which is what my concern is same as 1/7/21 itchy, swollen, red and bruised. Why I?m reporting is I?m wondering if I should take my 2nd dose or not from these reactions just at the injection site and only fatigue. This is Day 10. I also took pictures 1/8/21 and 1/15/21

I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

                                                On day 7 after receiving the vaccine, I noticed a small itchy lump in the muscle about 2 inches below the injection site.  I tried to rub the lump out slightly.  Throughout the day and the next, the skin became red and itchy and spread to a circle that is about 3in by 3 in.  Last night, I took ibuprofen and Benadryl.  The redness decreased slightly in the morning but has come back over the past few hours.  It is still itchy.  There is no longer a lump.

Acupuncture gave relief for 2 days so that I could lift it. Pain and ache returned. Ibuprofen and Tylenol do not lessen the pain at all.  Ache-type pain radiates down the arm and across the upper back. For the last 2 days, it hurts whether or not I?m moving it. The vaccine was given far too high in the arm.

Upon inspection RN observed redness, swelling, and irritation where pt had been scratching the site.  Offered to give pt benadryl on site, but pt refused because it &#34;knocks her out&#34; for 13 hours.  Advised to take a non-drowsy antihistamine when able, use cold compress, and stop scratching the site.  Pt was asked if she was having any other issues at that time, which she denied.  Telephone call made to patient at 4:18pm to follow up.  Pt stated she started to have an itchy throat and throat swelling and went to the hospital.  There she was offered Benadryl but declined.  She was given a steroid injection because she was having &#34;difficulty breathing&#34;.  Pt states ER doctor recommended a non-drowsy OTC antihistamine, and was unable to tell her if the difficulty breathing was an allergic reaction or due to anxiety.  Recommended following up with 2nd dose in 4 weeks but to see her PCP before that time to discuss.  Pt does not have PCP, so I recommended that she establish care and have an appt prior to her 2nd dose

Over the course of a few days it was getting worse, starting to mimic cellulitis. I went to the ER on the 8th day, was treated with a course Cephalexin. On the 10th day it continued to spread, I went back to the ER and was taken off antibiotics. It is now day 12 and the swelling has subsided, it is no longer hot to the touch. Some redness remains as well as itchiness. Topical creams (hydrocortisone) seem to relieve itch.

These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

                                                A few hours after the first dose (1/15), a welt grew around the injection site about the size of a silver dollar.  This went away after three days. Arm was sore for the first two days.  One week later (1/22), injection site became itchy, red and was very warm to the touch.  A welt formed as well. It started out the size of a silver dollar, and over the course of  48 hours the welt, itchiness, and redness grew to  the size of a large russet potato (Friday 1/22- Saturday1/23).  It was the most red around the injection site, with the most red being about the size of a silver dollar.  After 48 hours, it remained itchy, red, and had a welt  for the next 24 hours  (Sunday 1/24). The next morning (Monday 1/25) redness and swelling were gone but site was still a little itchy.  Site was only slightly tender throughout these three days but not painful. No other side effects were noticed i.e. fever, chills, chest pain.  Slight dizziness was felt if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything.

However, I noticed a burn like rash developed on only the arm where I received the vaccine. It would flare up from time to time and lasted about a week. Before reaching out to the clinic and providers, I was taking Benadryl nightly. I then used a steroid cream, which eventually helped resolve the issue. The rash was not like normal. It was not a red hive. It was a white cluster of hives that looked like blisters.

                                                ~24 hours after the vaccine, I got a mild rash on my face. This rash went away in about 12 hours. The rash was itchy and hot, but didn&#39;t last long. After this I noticed I would get stomach pain intermittently. This has not gone away yet (today&#39;s date is 1/28/20). The stomach pain has been intermittent, not related to certain foods, and hurts sometimes when I don&#39;t even eat. It has progressed into getting severely bloated every time I eat any foods. The bloating lasts ~1-2 hours after consumption. No matter how big or small the meal or snack is, or what the food is, it results in me being bloated.

Sudden confusion, burning heat and hives and burning red rash spreading from injection site, up neck and throat and down arm to hand. 5 days after the injection, a severe allergic reaction occurred where my entire body broke into hives and a red burning rash, again starting at the injection site. Throat tightness, itchiness in scalp and groin, and difficulty concentrating (all my usual symptoms of anaphylaxis) occurred. Advised by health care provider to take Benadryl immediately and to have epi-pens on hand. Loratadine was prescribed.

It is painful, itchy, and warm to the touch. Arm appears to be swelling at the site.  As of today (1/30/2021) symptoms are still present, swelling appears to have worsened.

                                                Vaccine given 01/27/21 at 6pm, symptom onset began around 6am on 01/28/21. I work nights so this was the end of my workday. Normally I stay up for a bit, but I felt achy and fatigued so I went to bed early. I woke up around 10am with a fever of 101.4 degrees, administered acetaminophen and went back to sleep. Woke up at 1pm and temp had dropped to 100.3, administered acetaminophen again and slept some more. My temp hovered around 100.3 until about 3pm on 01/29/21 when it dropped to 99.8. Around 6pm on 01/29/21 and about 48 hours after vaccination, my temp dropped to 98.9 and I went back to work. Along with fever I experienced headache, chills, skin sensitivity (likely due to the fever as that&#39;s a typical comorbidity for me), and body aches. I also had minor injection site side effects including redness and pain.

Woke up next morning with my fever maintained at 101 and a pounding throbbing headache. The injection site is also hard and red, with the bump increasing in size. I took Tylenol and slept then woke again at 6pm 2/2 with a 100.7 fever and body aches. Took more Tylenol and went to bed. This morning 2/3 I feel about 90% back to normal. The bump on my arm however is growing in size and more painful.

                                                With the second dose I felt arm pain at the injection site and muscle pains, my whole body was aching, specially my arms, both of them. My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

I took 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours for 24 hours, which provided minimal symptom relief. All symtpoms were relived within 72 hours of receiving the vaccine.

                                                Monday morning woke up with arm soreness, headache, fatigue and feeling slightly warm. After a few hours, and a nap, I had a fever of 101.9 along with chills, severe fatigue and severe nausea.  After a 2 more hours my fever raised to 103.3, I had muscle cramping in my legs, nausea, headache and fatigue.  All of those symptoms lasted until 9pm that night when the fever resolved.  The following day I still had slight warmness, a temperature of 99 and headache, chills and fatigue/weakness.  All of those symptoms, continued until Thursday evening.  On Friday morning I woke up with no headache (only mild intermittent head pains), mild fatigue and arm soreness.  Every day this week my heartrate has been higher than normal with the average rate around 120-130BPM. This was at rest, without any caffeine or other stimulants.  I took alternating tylenol (1000mg) and ibuprofen (800mg) all 4 days.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 3pm 1/13/21. I was fine for the 30 minutes after, not even sore at the injection site.  Around 6pm, my muscles started aching, but not painful enough to be concerned.  At 3am 1/14/21, I woke up in pain in every muscle. Enough to wake me, but not terrible.  At 7am, I noticed a pinpoint pain in my armpit, and my muscles still ached.  At 9:30am, I took ibuprofen to attempt to curb the pain a bit.  Around 10am, it got so painful I was limping, and having trouble bending down or reaching above shoulder height.  At 11:30am, I noticed the pinpoint pain in my armpit had gotten worse, and there is a hard, approximately quarter-sized round lump in this spot. Very painful.  At 2:30, I went to move my shirt sleeve and the pain at the injection site was so intense I screamed when I touched it.  This pain continued until 1/16/21 when I woke up feeling entirely normal.  Since 1/16/2021, my hands have been randomly stiffening, either completely stretched out and dropping anything in them, or closing tight enough to leave fingernail marks on my palms. I will also reach to grab things and my hands will sometimes bend into odd shapes, instead of what I intended for them to do. This began at 1-2 times a day, and is becoming more often. It is now up to 2-4 times daily.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                I received the first dose of Moderna vaccine Jan 26th 2021, On Feb 2nd, I developed what I thought was hives. I went to two doctors; the first being prompt care, the second being an emergency room doctor. My rash has been present for fives day today (Feb 6th), with no sign of healing. This rash is bliserous. It is on my face, arms, hands, wrists and a few splotches here and there on my torso and hips. I am currently taking steroids, they are not helping. This rash is absolutely miserable and unlike anything I have ever experienced .

She said her chest was tight. We gave a 50mg Benadryl and that helped with the symptoms. After observation for over 1.5 hours, she felt better and her hives was looking better. She was taking home and rest. After speaking with her the next day, she is describing tightness in the chest and hurts to breath. I instructed to follow up with her PCP

                                                The first vaccine I only had mild arm pain which went away after a few days, exactly 7 days later I had a delayed localized reaction (extreme swelling size of a golf ball, redness, itching, hot to the touch). I spoke with my primary and he recommended to still get the second vaccine. The second vaccine the swelling came on almost immediately (about 2 hours after). It has now been two days since I have had the shot and my arm is now double the size of my muscle. (I am petite, 5?3 and 107 lbs) so my arms are tiny. My arm is red, hot to the touch, swollen and itchy. I have had a fever of 102.8, the lowest I have gotten it down is 101.2 with around the clock Tylenol. Other side effects: vomiting, chills, high fever, EXTREME joint pain. I?m concerned about the localized reaction (I would call it localized allergic reaction). I have photos I?m not sure if I can send them.

Around 9 pm I checked my temperature and had a 99.3 degree fever. Throughout the night my fever increased to 101.8 and stayed within 100-101.8 for the next 8 hours. The next day I discovered I had a full body rash. It appeared like leopard spots. It did not have any raised bumps and did not itch but was hot to the touch. The rash persisted for another 24 hours.

                                                Around 5 pm on 2/11 (day of vaccination) I began to notice a very sore arm and dry mouth/dehydration. Drank water and continued as normal. Around 2 am of 2/12 I woke up with chills and had been sleeping very restlessly.  I had body aches in my arm, legs and back. Around 3am my temperature was 100.2. I also felt very faint when standing and thought I may pass out.  3 times when standing, I had to quickly sit down to avoid it. I do suffer from vasovagal syncope so this may be unrelated to vaccination. I took Tylenol and drank more water. Temp rose to about 100.6 before beginning to drop at around 4 am. I continued to take Tylenol every 4 hours and it helped keep temp below 100 but towards the end of the 4 hours, it would start to rise again. I ate normally and drank extra water due to feeling dehydrated still. Around 1 PM 2/12 I started to feel nauseous and had an upset stomach. I was still have a general body aches and elevated temperature around 99.5. My normal temp is usually about 98.0. Nausea led to diarrhea 1 time. Symptoms continued until approximately 8 pm when very quickly the body aches, nausea, fever and soreness in injection arm all went away. None of these symptoms have returned and it is now 2/13 at 8 pm.   I did test positive for Covid-19 on December 28, 2020 but have been fully recovered with no symptoms since 1/8/2021.

It does not itch, but appears to be spreading on the same arm of the vaccination.

No position was comfortable when lying down and nothing made the chills better. I also felt dehydrated, which is unusual for me. From 4am - 6:30am the symptoms reversed and I got extremely hot and uncomfortable. At 8am I noticed a prominent red, warm patch of  swelling around the injection site.

                                                I got flu like symptoms. Not really a fever, but I was warmer. Aside from that I felt like I had tachycardia. I already have issues with that but the vaccine made it worse. It went away on Monday, but I still had irregular heartbeat until around Wednesday. The 3 worst days were Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  The symptoms slowly went away, but yesterday seemed to be better.

                                                I noticed the day after I received my first dose of the vaccine, when I took off the band aid, that my skin had bubbled at the the injection site on my left arm. The day after that, the bubble of skin turned yellow. This morning my injection site still has a bubble of skin that is now red and looks like it can pop at any time. It has not grown any bigger since the first time I saw it.

                                                A couple of days after the  first vaccine shot my ears began to itch uncontrollably. After 2 weeks, it progressed to my neck, but was manageable with over the counter lotion. After the second shot a month later, the itching progressed to my chest and arms. It?s become painfully itchy and I believe it to be eczema. However, I have never had this skin condition in the past. I have kept the skin clean and tried many treatments short of going to a doctor. Rubbing alcohol, witch hazel, eucerin cream, hydrocortisone cream, Benadryl anti itch cream, Benadryl, washing my bedding, and cutting my hair away from the affected areas provided no relief.  It?s been 2 months since the first symptoms and nothing has changed. In fact, it?s progressively gotten worse.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

                                                I received my first dose of covid vaccine on 02/26/21 at Hospital. I felt completely fine the following day just minor soreness which I expected. On 03/07/21, exactly 10 days post my vaccine I developed hives/welts on both hands, both elbows , both knees, and toes  that were elevated. I also developed some minor swelling but no fever, no pain just los of itchiness. I was given a vaccine of Medrol to calm down the sxs and seem to be doing okay.

                                                In the middle of the night after receiving the shot at the site of the shot she began complaining of it itching. The site has been raised and red and sore for her. It is now on the third day and it is no longer red but she is still complaining that it itches off and on. There is no rash or anything. I have given her Benadryl and that seems to help.

Cold ice pack was held to the shoulder ~8 pm for about 15-20 minutes to try to reduce the swelling, with no observable effect. Swelling had stopped by 3/13/2021 upon waking up. Redness around the vaccine site in approximately an oval with max diameter of ~ 3 inches was noticed on the night of 3/12/2021 and was similarly red throughout the entirety of 3/13/2021. The site of the vaccine was slightly itchy and tender. By 3/14/2021 the redness was mostly gone, with the diameter reduced to ~1 inch and looking more brown than red (like an old bruise).

                                                No side effects from first dose of vaccine. Many side effects from second dose. Once second dose was administered, arm immediately became sore. This progressively got worse during the day, including a hard lump and was itchy. Approx. 6 hours later, I became fatigued and had body aches all over. At 30 hours post second vaccine, I started to run a temperature. It got up to 101.5 F, I took Tylenol and went to sleep. By the morning, it was gone. The next 2 days, I had a headache and very sore arm. On day 3 I developed a very sore armpit/under arm area on the same arm as I received the vaccine. As I&#39;m writing this (4 days later), my arm is still sore &amp; itchy and my underarm area is still sore, but no fatigue or fever.

No loss of breathing or swallowing. Pt took 25mg of Benadryl which stopped the swelling within the hour.  By 20 minutes, left side of face from top of head to collarbone became numb which persisted over the next 72 hours, with numbness/discomfort lasting through the week after the injection (today is 1 week). Twitching of fingers, arms, and legs also began around minute 20 and subsided about an hour after injection. No weakness of muscles or droopiness. Pt also experienced severe pain at injection site over the following 48 hours, immobilizing the left arm.

The raised knot was tender to touch. I visited the clinic to alert the nurse of my reaction. I was told to take benadryl. I took one benadryl  per day on both Tuesday, March 16 - Wednesday, March 17.  By Thursday, March 18, 2021, I did not experience anymore itching and the raised knot was no longer present. I am no longer taking benadryl.

When I woke up the next morning, I still felt itchy all over. I worked from home all day today, and after seeing that no one had experienced itching all over online, I decided to schedule an appointment with my doctor for later in the afternoon (after work). Until then, I tried to use some anti-itch cream to help relieve some of the itchiness and overall discomfort. It did not help at all. By the time I went to the doctor, my arms were splotchy and my legs were a little splotchy. I had not really noticed it because I was working in very low lighting all day, but when I went in the doctor&#39;s office, the nurse asked about it. It was definitely NOT normal, and the doctor checked both of my arms, my back, my tummy, and my legs. I had some slight splotching on my legs, but my back and tummy were okay. Both of my arms had the worst of it. The doctor then gave me a steroid shot and a prescription to help with the allergic reaction.

                                                Called around 9:40am. The patient reported that she has started to get itchy on her arms. Denies rash. Denies shortness of breath and swelling of her lips, tongue and face. She reports that she had a previous anaphylactic reaction to a meningitis vaccine. She does not have an epi pen. She started to feel like her throat was getting hoarse, so she used her albuterol inhaler. It seemed to help after a few minutes. She was also given benadryl 25mg capsule and famotidine 20mg tablet to help with itching. Physical exam was WNL, no swelling of lips, tongue or face noted. No urticaria. Lungs CTA bilaterally. Heart RRR. She was monitored until a little after 10:00am and reported that she felt like her symptoms were not worsening. Denied shortness of breath. She was heading to the school to study, so she was advised to study in a public area and to let doctor or someone else at the school know what happened so someone could check on her.

                                                Mild muscle soreness in right arm (injection site) beginning within an hour post-injection, noticeable with movement. Took 400mg of ibuprofen before bed.  At 10.5 hours post-injection (middle of night), right arm soreness was moderate-to-severe at rest and severe, almost unbearable, with movement. Mild muscle soreness and joint pain were present throughout the body; joint pain (wrist, elbows, and knees) was an issue prior to injection and was exacerbated during the event.  I also experienced chills and sharp headache pains. Took 400mg of ibuprofen, 1000mg of acetaminophen, and secured right arm with a pillow, which allowed me to fall back asleep.   At 17.5 hours (following morning), muscle soreness was present in right arm alone and was mild at rest, moderate with movement. All other symptoms were gone. Experienced fatigue that afternoon (approx. 24 hours post-injection), treated effectively with a short nap and vitamin D (through sun exposure).  On the 2nd full day post-injection, right arm muscle soreness is minimal with movement.

In addition to the light soreness, there was a slightly ovular light red mark on my arm, similar to what others have dubbed &#34;COVID arm&#34;. Soreness and the red patch lasted about 46 ish hours in total.

                                                I developed a red welt/hive at the injection site within a few hours of receiving the shot. It is currently two-three inches in diameter, hard to touch, and hot to touch. It is a little painful just like a sore arm after other vaccinations. It itches a little bit. I?ve treated with an antihistamine and switching between acetaminophen and Ibuprofen since it?s development. These have not effected it much.

                                                The first adverse event I noticed was a red, inflamed and itchy rash at the site of the injection. It was slightly painful and warm to the touch. I spoke with a few others who experienced similar reactions.  I took over the counter antihistamines in an attempt to treat it for several days.   One or two days after the rash appeared I started to feel sharp intense pain in my groin and around the vaginal opening to the point that it interfered with me sleeping and sitting comfortably. I have had a history of muscle spasms and vaginal pain (vaginismus, muscle contraction pain) but it was more intense and unprovoked which is why I wanted to reach out honestly? It?s a bit alarming. If other women/people with vaginas are experiencing this it would bring me some relief to know the cause and treatment.

                                                Like I said previously, it initially started that night, I got the fever and chills, which I was told to expect along with the extreme body aches and tiredness. Most of it (the fever, chills, body aches) went away Sunday and I was just tired with pain in my left arm where the shot was. All of these things didn?t worry me so much, however, Sunday night, the mouth area of my face along with my chin started breaking out into hives. My boyfriend gets hives often so he gave me some Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream that I left on overnight. Today the apparently went down a bit, but they?re still present and I?m unsure what to make of it. I applied more of the cream hoping for the best. Nothing I ate is out of the ordinary from what I usually eat, so it couldn?t be food related and I don?t have a history of hives, so I?m not sure. I still have them and am kind of waiting it out, I?m unsure if mask wearing is gonna help this situation.

                                                I woke up and my arm was really swollen with a red ring around the injection site and really hot. I also generally felt sick. I waited until the next day to see the doctor. He examined my arm and said the reaction was so delayed that it concerned him. He put me on a steroid and antibiotic in case there was infection. He told me to contact an allergist, who said it was too soon to get tested to see if I was allergic to the vaccine since they don&#39;t have a test for it. So, my doctor just told me to continue the meds. He also advised me to not get the 2nd dose and I haven&#39;t. I still have random shots of pain at the injection site.

It was hot to the touch, itchy and sore to the touch. It lasted for seven to nine days, but did not lead me to seek medical treatment. DOSE 2: I noticed a 3in diameter rash around the injection site of my vaccine on *day two*. It was hot to the touch, itchy and sore to the touch. It lasted for seven to nine days, but did not lead me to seek medical treatment.  VAGINAL ULCER (dose 2 only) I had a 5mm diameter ulcer on the inside of my left labia minora. I began having pain two days after my vaccine, where it felt uncomfortable to wear underwear or tight pants, but it wasn&#39;t until the morning of the fourth day that I investigated the pain and saw the ulcer.  I went to a local urgent care in the afternoon of the fourth day, where the nurses took a surface swab of the ulcer, drew blood for an STD panel, and performed a Pap smear. I was given one week worth of valacyclovir, an antibiotic (which I do not remember the name of), and fluconazole to prevent a (or treat a possible) yeast infection.  I took one dose of valacyclovir the evening of the fourth day and the morning of the fifth day with no apparent improvement. I did not take any additional doses, as it was recommended by my provider that if it was not effective within 24 hours, then it may not be effective at all.  I took all doses of the antibiotic and fluconazole.  I began to see improvements (reduced pain, shrinking size) by the seventh day. The ulcer disappeared completely by the twelfth day.

It is sometimes itchy but not too bad. It has a large eliptical like shape. I first noticed it on Wednesday night and it can still be seen today (four days later). It is now smaller/less raised/less red than when I first noticed it. I didnt report it on the vsafe app because I didnt notice it until after I stopped reporting to the app. I have not seen a doctor about it.

                                                About 2 weeks after the first vaccine I started noticing hives on my L arm. These hives eventually turned into wheals and were extremely itchy.   The wheals would then turn darker red and eventually disappear.   The next location of the wheal was my R arm, followed by my R calf and then L calf.   As of right now I have a rash on my L foot and L side of my face.   I have never experienced rashes like this in the past.

                                                Received vaccination around 10:15 AM and began experiencing soreness in left arm around 1 PM. Consumed regular diet and drank about 2 L of fluids until 6 PM. Laid in bed around 5 PM and got up at 6 PM to urinate. Felt fine, just a bit tired and sore arm.   While urinating, experienced slight nausea. When washing hands, experienced dizziness and lightheadedness. Attempted to stabilize self on doorway of bathroom and quickly after exiting bathroom, lost consciousness and fainted. Remained unconscious for a couple of minutes and returned with full clarity and processing, but weakness. Checked bp about 3 hrs later and was very low, with orthostatic numbers even lower. Fever measured at 100.5 F. Took 250 mg Tylenol and hydrated.   Days later, bp remains low -- Friday, one day after: standing - 81/57 with temperature of 101.4 F, remaining entire day, with fatigue, joint pain, muscle cramps.  on Monday: 86/64, with fatigue, no fever   Bp is usually on lower side of healthy range, but no history of clinically low blood pressure, nor orthostatic bp.

This went away after an hour. Then a few hours later the same thing happen in my left arm. That also resolved in a few hours. 26 hours after my shot, at just before 1:00pm the following day, I felt the subtle cramping at the base of my pinky and ringer finger on my left hand. This has lasted for a half an hour.   Other than the above, I have experienced fatigue, pain at injection site, slight nose congestion, and dry throat/slight throat discomfort (i.e. feeling dry and only slightly swollen or congested)

                                                One week after the injection I started developing a rash that started out the size of a quarter and has been getting increasingly worse since it developed 4 days ago.  The rash is now larger than a softball and is swollen, red and itchy. Along with the rash I have been increasingly experiencing shortness of breath when talking, clammy skin, excessive sweating, body aches, and fatigue. The bottoms of my feet have also been itchy. I have been taking Pepcid and Benadryl which have helped to alleviate symptoms. I contacted my primary care doctor and hope to speak with her in the next 24-48 hours.

                                                One week after receiving my 2nd dose, I developed small, red, dry patches of skin on my torso and chest area. They have been spreading and increasing daily. I received a steroid shot just today and Clotrimazole-Betamethasone cream to apply. Am awaiting results of this treatment.

I left after about an hour under observations. It has been about 2 hours since the shot and I still feel light headed and a little fatigue.

Arm was very sore for a while and on March 6th, it started turning red and swollen at injection site. It grew to about 5 inches long and 4 inches wide. Arm was very sore. Did not itch. After 5 days of growing, it went away overnight. I used warm compresses to help.

                                                On Sunday after the injection, my left deltoid muscle was sore but manageable. On Sunday night, the deltoid was very tender and my body was sore. On Monday I feel fatigue and body soreness all day. On Tuesday my body aches and arm soreness was minimal or gone, but I developed a rash on my left arm in the bend of my elbow around 5PM. The rash was itchy and looked similar to an eczema outbreak. The rash on Tuesday went away after a few hours. On Wednesday morning the rash was popping up on different parts of my body and is very red and itchy. The rashes are about the size of my hand and located on my right leg behind my knee and inside of my thigh, my entire left arm, and the right side and back of my neck and my right shoulder.

It went down after a few days and then reoccurred on day 9 and got bigger through day 10. She indicated it was about twice the size of the 1st time. Complained of tenderness, irritation, feeling nauseated and having headache. I called her on day 11 and she said she felt it was starting to subside and she felt a little better.

                                                I received the vaccination on April 25th at 2:15pm. I waited at the facility until 2:30pm to be sure I didn&#39;t have any immediate side effects or allergic reactions. Upon arriving home around 3:00pm, I noticed the injection sight had become itchy. I then noticed later in the day that my arm was beginning to hurt and the pain progressively got worse. By the end of the day, I was unable to move my arm much without any pain.  The next morning (April 26th), the injection sight was swollen upon physical examination but was not noticably swollen. I did not check the sight through the day but noticed at the end of the day when getting ready for bed (around 9:00pm) that the injection sight was swollen, itchy, red, and extremely sensitive to touch.   Today, April 27th, the sight is still red, sensitive, and swollen but the pain level in relation to moving my arm has decreased dramatically throughout the day and I am able to move with little to no pain.

Redness, swelling, itching and slight pain at the area of vaccination on my left arm.  I had all of these when I got the vaccine, they started to die down and then came back around a week after the vaccine was administered. I had no other adverse reactions or signs of allergic reaction to the vaccine.

Symptoms began at 10pm on 4/26 (got 2nd dose at 1:00pm that same day) and resolved at 10am with sleep and ibuprofen. Also I have a strange rash under my right eye that appeared on 4/27. The rash is not painful or itchy. It?s just reddish purple with some minor swelling. With the first dose I had a skin reaction on my back similar to pityriasis rosea, which leads me to believe the rash under my eye is related to the vaccine as well.

We administered 50 mg of diphenhydramine onsite. The reaction did not progress so the patient left the pharmacy after 30 minutes. She continued to take scheduled diphenhydramine until 4/21/21. The patient also reports needing to use her rescue albuterol inhaler more frequently than usual for the first two weeks following the vaccination. The rash remained for 1 to 2 weeks. The patient sought medical care with an immunologist Hospital. Dr.  prescribed no additional medication, but told the patient not to receive the second dose.

The morning of April 30th no fever nor soreness but around 10 am temperature spiked from 98.7 to 100.7. Took 2 Tylenol pill ands temperature decreased.

On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) and FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug). On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period) and PALLOR (Pale as a ghost).

Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medications were reported. Treatment medications include Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) for diarrhea for 1.5 days (unknown dose/frequency).  Patient waited out 20 minutes post-vaccination and then went to the bathroom. When she came out of bathroom she fainted, paramedics were summoned. Mother took patient to Emergency Room(ER) 20 April 2021, after taking her first to urgent care (who directed mother to take patient to the ER), ER sent her home saying it was just a little stomach bug, but no one else in the family got this &#34;bug&#34;.  Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

It got worse and worse over time and on the third night after eating Thai food which I always eat, my face started to swell and I went to the ER. I?m taking a steroid and Benadryl now.

Patient reports no pain in bumpy area. Patient tried oral diphenhydramine last night (5/23/21) and went to the local urgent care today to have area checked.  She called back and said they told her it was likely just a localized reaction and gave her an antihistamine to take if needed. She was advised to go back to the Dr if rash progressed or spread.

                                                I had a sensation of what I can describe as either a mild sunburn or chafing all over my body. My most sensitive areas were the back of my leg bottom of my feet and both arms. Sensitive to the touch and even wearing my clothes was uncomfortable. It started when I woke up around 6 am I went to work and was able to get to 11 o clock but on my break I got Benadryl and took it. I noticed my skin had a faint red undertone. 30 minutes after the Benadryl the symptoms all started to subside

                                                I received my vaccine on May 17th and exactly eight days later, May 25, I woke up with what is known as &#34;Moderna Arm.&#34; My left arm where the injection was became, red, hard, swollen and itchy. Throughout the day on May 25th I then started to develop small red bumps on my hands. On May 26th, I woke up with more bumps on my hands, torso, legs and feet. By Thursday May 27th I had them from head to toe. The palms of my hands, feet, the tops of my hands and feet, elbows and knees were by far the worst. The rest of the bumps were spread throughout the rest of my body. Friday, May 28th I had even more and they were extremely itchy and painful. I also had a headache and slept most of the days. By Saturday May 29th they began to seem to heal. It is now June 1 and my feet, knees, hands and elbows still have some but the rest of my body has healed for the most part. I took a lot of Benadryl and put anti itch cream on but nothing seemed to really help.

She said that she felt light-headed and that she was itching all over. I gave her Benadryl 25 and asked her wait around. After about 10 minutes she said that she needed my help. She said that she needed an EpiPen shot because her heart was racing, she was sweating, and her tongue was beginning to feel swollen. I gave her the EpiPen shot and called 911. She was released from the hospital about midnight.

It was also incredibly painful,  such as when my shirt was just resting on it, as shirts do. This lasted for 2 days and it still has some redness and sensitivity. The joints on my hands and wrist also became swollen and incredibly sore, and this has still not gone away.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

Just bumps - not itchy or hot to touch Nausea that has stayed since the day after the injection. But I&#39;ve been able to keep food down.  Severe stiffness in left arm that made it hard to lift arm - only stayed for 2 days and then it cleared

                                                Initially, there was soreness, swelling, and redness (all around upper arm - a bit below deltoid) around injection site over the course of a few days. The area was warm to the touch compared to the rest of the arm. All symptoms went away after 5 days. Exactly 7 days later, a little bit of the soreness came back and there was a redness marking the size of a 50 cent coin. The next day, the soreness grew and the redness spread and the area became warm to the touch again. I talked to a doctor over video chat to talk about what I should do - I was advised to use an ice compress, which I did a few times on and off. The next day (today), redness spread, but soreness and feeling warm to the touch stayed the same. I went to urgent care and was given 7-day antibiotics and told to use Claritin/Zyrtec to lower my histamines. If anything progresses, I should let the provider know.

After one dose of 650 mg acetaminophen my temperature went back down to 98.6 F. The next day 1/7/21 I did not have a fever; I still had mild chills and headache and pain at the site of injection. For the pain I took 1,000 mg of acetaminophen at morning and at night which eased the pain. The following day 1/8/20 I did not have headache or chills and had very mild pain which was tolerable.

Those symptoms completely resolved then on 1/5/2021, 1 week after my vaccination, I noticed itchy red bumps over the injection site.

I saw my primary care provider on 1/7/2021 and she advised taking Benadryl and started me on Augmentin.

On Tuesday 1/5/2021 developed hives on feet and ankles. Dizziness worsened and hives had spread to hands and wrists the following day. Upon arriving to work on Thursday 1/7/2021, hives had progressively gotten worse and I was tachycardic. Called employee health where I was instructedto go to the ED. Was tachycardic 100-130 bpm and hypertensive 156/112mmHg upon arrival to the ED. Received IV Benadryl and Decadron for the reaction/hives. Viotals were normal upon discharge. Continued with Prednisone and benadryl. Taking Meclizine to help with dizziness.

I developed a low fever of 101.1F and had chills. By the  next morning your symptoms were relieved.  I did get diagnosed last Tuesday with Covid which was one week after the Moderna vaccine. A few days after I got diagnosed with Covid, the swelling returned at the injection site.   As of today I have no redness or swelling anymore at the injection site.

It is not painful or itchy, just warm to the touch. Over night, the area got less red and less warm but the swollen area had gotten larger.

Mildly tender to touch. Rash post-vaccine day 9 now covers entire shoulder. I would like to know if it is safe to take dose 2 or not...should I take any precautions prior to the second dose? Please follow-up.

                                                After receiving the vaccine 1/9 in my left arm, I had normal side effects of chills, body aches, and fatigue. On 1/14, I noticed the left supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged, no pain with palpitation. On 1/15 the underside of my left arm was itchy but no visible rash. On 1/16 the arm was still itchy and the lymph node was more enlarged. No neck or axillary nodes were enlarged. On 1/17 in the morning I woke up with a large red rash on my left deltoid. It was not itchy, but as the day went on was more red, raised, and warm. The node in my neck was causing some neck discomfort. I presented to Urgent Care and was treated for a local reaction. I was given a steroid cream to use on my arm and was told to take an OTC antihistamine. I have been using the cream for 2 days and so far the rash is resolving but is still visible. The node has not yet decreased in size.

                                                Starting 01/16/2021, there was itchiness and a cluster of red papules/wheals that showed up on my right back. The rash continued to spread the next few days with increasing papules and itchiness. The rash is localized to my torso. Most are on my right abdomen and right back but is now spreading to my left side and upper back. There are also a few under and on my right breast and below both my armpit areas. The rash is still erythematous, with some that are papular and some appearing like vesicles. There is still itchiness and some stinging sensation. I am currently on Hydroxyzine 25MG at night and Zyrtec OTC during day but it has only been 2 days since I started the meds. The itch does wake me up at night time. So far the antihistamines have helped a bit with the itch. At the same time, I appear to have a sore throat though it feels more like a mild swelling of my throat as whenever I swallow it feels sore.

                                                About 30 min after the vaccination I felt dizzy. It felt almost like I had gotten up too quickly and felt dizzy, that kind of dizziness. Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

                                                I started to notice on Tuesday, January 19th, that there was a red bump on my arm. It looked more like a mosquito bite to me and was not bigger than a quarter. It didn?t feel itchy but I thought nothing of it. I noticed when I got home it was twice as big but I still felt no pain. It appeared that my arm was also swollen. The following day on Wednesday, it has grown in size again covering my arm, maybe the size of four quarters. Throughout the day it felt a bit hot, especially when I touched it. It did not feel itchy and I didn?t feel any pain. I felt a bit tired this day so I?m not sure if it was because of it. The redness has gone down today (Friday, January 22nd) however the mark is still big and in the shape of a square now. The outer part of the mark is more red and raised up, like it has a red border.

It is slightly swollen and mildly tender but not itchy or painful otherwise. I should note that I had a rather significant amount of swelling and pain for the first few days after the injection, but it subsided after 4-5 days.

Used Benadryl which didn?t seem to stop it.   Now it?s been two weeks since I?ve received the shot and rash is still here, currently using cortizone-10 to help with itchiness

It had a knot on it and a red ring about 3 inches around the injection site. I placed a cold pack on my arm for 15-20 minutes. The area was still hot to touch for another 12-24 hours. The hotness has subsided and most of the itching, but my arm still feels sore and has about a 2.5 inch red area around it. Note that my swelling, redness and itching had completely subsided before this particular shower. I did not use any different products in my shower than I had used the days previously following my injection.

                                                I first got symptoms on Jan 19th with extreme muscle soreness from my shoulders to my toes with hives on my thighs and what felt like a bug bite on my knuckle and a circular bite on my left forearm.  The muscle soreness was there for 3 days.  It was very hard to walk for a while cause of just the soreness.  I still feel a little in my ankles and toes still but fully recovered.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

                                                Despite not having any abnormal reactions immediately following the vaccine (except for pain at site of injection, muscle aches, chills - which went away after 3 days), a week after the vaccine, I noticed that my left arm was hard around the injection, and a bit itchy. I massaged it a bit, and it started hurting - that night, I woke up from the pain, and had to take ibuprofen to sleep (probably 4/10). The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better. This went on all of Friday as well - I took some Benadryl, and that seemed to make it better (or it might have just made me sleepy enough that I didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not sure). I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness. Sunday, the redness in both areas continued to fade, but the bumps were noticeable and more itchy than before. The hardness seems to have resolved almost completely, although the area is still a bit sore when massaged.

                                                At the time of the vaccination, I experienced a sore arm for about 48 hours, and muscle aches and chills for about 12 hours.   7 days after receiving the vaccination, I noticed a rash at the injection site. It was somewhat itchy for 2 days, and continue to grew in size for 4 days. The rash was improved by taking over the counter allergy medicine (Allegra 24 hour). It was slightly raised and swollen the first 2 days, but decreased over the following days although the rash itself got larger.  I did not seek medical attention because I did not have any other symptoms or side effects with the rash, and was able to self-treat with allergy meds.

My left arm began to itch around lunch time that day and a little bit later I decided to look at my arm. My arm was red, hot to the touch and swollen at the injection site. I put cold compresses on it that afternoon and took a Benadryl for a couple of days and it resolved on its own.

Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

                                                7 days after receiving the vaccine, I developed a large, warm red blotch about 3-4in in diameter on my left deltoid. The following day, this blotch spread more than an inch down my arm and developed a prominent red ring around the border.  For a couple days, I took Zyrtec, thinking I may have been bitten by something, which had no effect. 10 days after getting the vaccine, I had an in-person appointment with my PCP who examined my arm and reported to me that this has been seen in patients who received the Moderna vaccine, usually appearing 5-7 days following vaccine administration. Today (11 days after the vaccine), the blotch continues to spread but appears less red and is clearing in the center where it originated. No fever, minimal swelling, hot/warm to the touch at times, no itching, border is slightly raised at times. I was told to monitor and call if I see red streaks traveling from the area indicating infections.

Had shoulder soreness day 2 post vaccine and was taking Motrin and Tylenol with some relief. Pain continued to get better. On day 9 post vaccine, pain returned with intensity and was seen at urgent care on 1/9. Shoulder was swollen and red at the time, so urgent care NP diagnosed cellulitis and I was prescribed Keflex, along with instruction to continue taking Motrin, Tylenol. Called out of work on 1/11 d/t shoulder pain/decreased range of motion. Today (1/13) pain is much better but still having some pain/discomfort in the shoulder.

I took a Zyrtec because I thought my friends dog was giving me a little allergies. 20 minutes later my throat itch got progressively worse to where I started to feel a little wheezy and harder to breathe. My arm where the vaccine was felt itchy. I had a rash all on my left arm and upper chest where I had received the vaccine. Immediately, I took a benadryl then went to sleep. Around 3 AM I woke up uncontrollably shivering. My fiance was able to get me a heater because I was so chilled with shivers but was sweating profusely. These shivers lasted about an hour to where I finally just went to sleep. I woke up around 7 AM with a pounding headache so I finally decided to take my temperature. It was 102 F. I ran a fever all day and brought it down to 100 with ibuprofen.  I ran a slight fever the next day as well with extreme fatigue.

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

Later that same day at 8 pm in the evening  my right arm where i received the injection started hurting. I had a small bump around the injection site It was also tender to the touch. I Iced my arm I also applied hot compress to the injection site. I also had some chills as well. I took acetaminophen to relieve the discomfort. Today is 1/2/2021 and i am feeling a lot better. My arm has stopped bothering me. I don&#39;t have a bump around the injection site and it isn&#39;t tender to the touch. I have also stopped taking the acetaminophen and i don&#39;t have any chills. I only had this reaction for one day.

On Sunday 1/17 there was a large visible rash localized to my left deltoid. The lymph node was causing some neck discomfort as well. I presented to the Urgent Care as was given steroid cream to apply and I have also been instructed to take an OTC antihistamine.

                                                Very itchy arm that has persisted, this far, to a month after getting the vaccine. At the injection site and around that general portion of my upper arm. Sometimes it&#39;s perfectly fine, sometimes it&#39;s red or pink and either will or will not be itchy as well. If I scratch at it too much, which I try really hard not to but it&#39;s really hard not to, and then the little rash-looking areas turns into a small area of mini skin hives. Still redish/pink and itchy. Then I try not to mess with it for the most part, but it&#39;s just consisted since then. Idk if this is a me problem, specifically cause I got some weird skin hive stuff going on actually on my eyes at night (randomly) that randomly occur. And that started way before I got the vaccine. With the hives on my arms, it will persist for a while at a time and go away before coming right back again as itchy as ever. It&#39;s been basically every single day since I got my vaccine that these side effects have been going on. #StillSupportIt lol. (:

                                                7 days after the vaccination, I developed an itchy, red,  rash just below the site of injection, about the size of a nickel. The nurses administering the COVID vaccines suggested that I call the on-call allergist. He said not to worry. He recommended that I take an allergy pill each day until the rash/bump went away. He also said to ice the rash/bump and massage the area. 8 days after the vaccination, the rash welted, remained red and itchy, and grew about 6 times larger than the day before. The nurses administering the COVID vaccine called the same on-call allergist that I spoke to the day before and he recommended to take the allergy pill twice a day and continue the ice and massage of the area. 9 days after the vaccination, the rash started to get better. 10 days after the vaccination, the rash was mostly gone. 11 days after the vaccination, the rash was all gone.

I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was able to taste the vaccine,. Within 5 minutes I felt dizzy and within 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t feel my arm.  I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

On 2/3 my arm felt very warm, so I looked at it in a mirror and found a large, round/hexagonal area of swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness. Today is 2/6 and it continues to spread the redness, swelling, and warmth down towards my elbow. It occasionally itches, but is usually painful and stings.

Now, (3 days after injection) swelling still present. Still hot and hard to the touch and size remains the same. Pain and redness mostly resolved. Now starting to itch.

And then it lessened so I could use it but still pain for three or four days. Redness on injection site - just a big, red spot (not rash). Red spot went away and then a big white spot - six days for white spots. Almost like my arm wasn&#39;t getting blood - just white like that for a few days. Headache - still have it - minor enough when I wake up but when I go to bed that every other day I&#39;m still taking medicine for it; nausea; fever; chills; hot flashes - lasted 5 or six days; fatigue - still have a little fatigue. It is better than it was. At first I was sleeping 15-16 hours a day. Still have to go to bed earlier than normal. Stomach pain - those are gone now; runny nose; loss of appetite; brain fog - I knew what I wanted to say or do but couldn&#39;t. Advil was taken and I tried Tylenol, too. I iced my arm. I did a humidifier.

The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

                                                I developed red, itchy blotches on the right side of my stomach approximately 1.5 weeks after my first Moderna dose. I did not take any medications to treat these symptoms and they have faded away for the most part. There is significantly less redness and no longer an urge to scratch.  I have not experienced any other serious adverse reactions. I was advised to see an allergist, however, my insurance requires that I see my PCP to get a prior auth/referral for an allergy specialist. The allergist that is contracted with the Super POD has a 50&#43; person waitlist and I will be going to my local urgent care to see a provider.

                                                Small swollen circle around injection site appeared just under a week after receiving vaccination. Approximately the diameter of a kiwi. Swollen spot is pink, warm to touch, and itchy. Not severe. I looked it up and it sounds like what people are calling &#34;COVID arm&#34; and the site said to report it to this site.

Later in the day I noticed that same area turn red. The following day the reddened, itchy, area became slightly darker in color but less red and had a darker ring around the edge of the discolored area. The next day the discolored area looked the same. By Friday (2/26/2021) the discolored area began to go away but the ring around it was still prominent.

Took 2 Tylenol every 6 hours, lots of fluids, took 2 ibuprofen about 30 hours after getting vaccine because fever would not reduce.  Symptoms began to subside 32 hours after vaccine.

                                                1 week and 1 day later it was noted while showering that there was a 2 in red raised mark surrounding the injection site that was itchy. 2 days prior to red mark appearing I was experiencing extreme headaches, fatigue, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. At this time on 2/28/2021, I still have the raised red mark on my area but it has lightened and it is still itching. My lymph nodes are still swollen and a headache is still present as well as fatigue but the sore throat has mostly resolved.

She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

Bodyaches and it hurt to touch my skin. It lasted about 12 hours.  A little Nausea. I took Tylenol 10 hours after shot and the Zofran for Nausea. The next day I was really run down for three more days.

I also had severely painful swollen axillary lymph nodes on the same side that I received my injection. I was not able to work or do any of my daily activities for almost three days. Then on day 7 after receiving my first vaccine dose, I developed a itchy, painful, red rash and hives surrounding the injection site (about a two to three inch radius around the injection site. I also got hives and red itchy painful skin on my face. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed prednisone and a week of pepside and zyrtec. After a week I stopped taking the allergy meds and then the hives came back, so I kept taking the allergy meds until my second vaccine dose.

By day 1 after the vaccine I also had hives and a rash at the injection site. A week after my second dose, I also had more hives pop up on my face and a bit at the injection site. And every few weeks, I have a few come up at the injection site and on my face, and then they go away.

Hives stayed for 4 days start to finish and were unaffected by benedryl and other antihistamine drugs. Cortisone creams also had no effect. Hives were raised but not red and did not bother me other than visually.

I noticed swelling in my arm and began taking Ibuprofen.  Sometimes my arm would begin to &#34;wake up&#34; and my whole are would tingle. On 3/7/2021 I developed a red area around the injection site and my arm swelling was more pronounced.  My arm also feels hot somtimes.    I have continued to take Ibuprofen and place ice on my arm in the evening.  I continue to have the swelling, hot arm, red patch, and pain in my arm as of today.  The &#34;numb&#34; feeling is something that comes and goes.

The area feels warm to the touch, it doesn&#39;t feel painful, but uncomfortable. It is about the diameter of my thumb, albeit not a perfect circular shape.

                                                I was vaccinated Monday evening 3/8. On Tuesday I noticed a small rash on my left arm around the elbow area. By Tuesday evening it had spread over most of my left arm. When I woke up Wednesday 3/10, the rash had spread to my stomach and upper thigh. By Wednesday evening, it haha spread to my chest, neck, back, and legs.

The sleep aid did not help as I only slept a few hours but could not stay asleep due to the pain. I woke up at 7 AM to feed my cat, then tried to lay back down, but was unable to. I went to the toilet feeling nauseous and wretched a few times but did not throw up. I did, however, experience diarrhea that morning and throughout the day. I laid down on the couch and fell in and out of sleep for a few hours. I felt the headache most of the morning, until about 11 AM,. I felt the chills throughout most of the day. I treated my pain with ibuprofen 200mg tablets (3 taken each time, 4-6 hours apart), Pepto-bismol for the nausea and had mostly liquids such as water and juice as well as bread and crackers. I felt much better by around 2 PM, except for the tenderness and swelling in my arm.

                                                When originally obtaining the vaccine, I had little side effect; the only thing I noticed was a slight fever for a few hours and a sore arm for a few days. 8 days after the shot was given, I developed a small swollen welt at the site of injection. I thought it may have been a mosquito bite, as I had spent the evening outside. That evening, I kept an eye on the swelling, and it was about the size of a half-dollar coin by the time I went to bed. When I woke up throughout the night (this is normal, as my sleeping patterns are irregular) I noticed more soreness in my arm. When I awoke for the day, the swelling had grown to be about the size of my hand. It is now sorer, and somewhat itchy, but I am managing with ibuprofen.

The morning after the vaccination, I also had fever, chills, headache, joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue. The fever was relieved somewhat by an ibuprofen, and went away entirely about 24 hours after the injection. Other symptoms subsided more slowly. The second day after the vaccination, I still had a mild headache and some joint and muscle discomfort, and my right arm was still painful, though somewhat improved by evening. The third day after the vaccine (Monday 3/15), I had no symptoms except occasional joint pain and a slight soreness of the vaccination site.

                                                One week after vaccine, injection site became extremely swollen (approx. 2&#34;x3&#34; induration), burning hot to the touch, tender &amp; itchy, arm became numb. General malaise, low grade fever. Site reaction spread down arm, went to urgent care &amp; was told it may be cellulitis &amp; was given antibiotics &amp; told to go to ER if it continued to spread. It spread outside of line that was drawn the next day so I went to ER. They did nothing &amp; told me remain on antibiotics &amp; to see allergist &amp; PCP. Reaction continued to spread, arm/hand numbness &amp; general feeling of illness, slight fever continued for approx. 2 weeks following vaccine. Site reaction fully subsided visually by 1/26 (began 1/15). Allergist suggested it was severe immune reaction to vaccine. Felt generally unwell for approx. 5 weeks following vaccine. Was told I should not get second dose or any covid/flu vaccines in the future. I have history of poor reaction to vaccines/site reactions.

Later that same day around 9:00pm I noticed a uncolored 2 1/2 inch in diameter welt on my arm and it was very very itchy. I took Benadryl and went to bed. March 19, 2021 I woke up and the swelling went down a little but now the area is very red. Slightly itchy.

I may need to seek medica attention if it persists.

She denied that the rash had spread but was uncomfortable and that her throat was burning and really scratchy.   Our nurse here at the health dept. advised her to call her physician now and if symptoms worsened to go to the ER. I called patient this afternoon at 4:30 pm and she said that her doctor had given her a Benadryl shot and had sent her to the ER. She was on her way when I called her so I will call back tomorrow.

                                                I felt arm pain in my left arm Around 4:00 pm, I started reaching for my face but I could not feel my face - it felt numb and tingly. That went on for two hours. There was no other droopiness juts facial numbness. My arm pain lasted for a good three weeks. It caused the lymph nodes under my armpit to swell. The pain went from my axilla Lymph nodes down to my left breast.  I got a pinkish, reddish, itchy rash at the spot on the injection about a week later. I don&#39;t recall the date for the doctor visits - one telehealth and one in person. They wanted me to use Primrose oil to massage the oil. They told me to keep an eye on it. I still continue to get the pain under my arm pit from time to time. I have still been seeing physician about that.

                                                Almost immediately felt warm sensation in left forearm near the elbow that started to become itchy. Then, a day later I noticed my arm was swelling about 3-5 inches from the injection site. Where it was swelling it became red, hard, and warm to the touch. My arm continued to itch in the said area and the size and symptoms persisted for about 2 weeks. I started doing cold compresses and taking Tylenol after week 2, the symptoms seemed to slowly subside over about 3-4 days. I total it took about 2 and a half weeks to rid of the side effects.

She came to the pharmacy today (3-27-21) and showed me the large red area on her arm. She said it is red, tender, and itching.  She said is also warm to the touch. It is a very LARGE area of redness.  I told her to watch it and if it got worse to go the ER/DR.  It is a very large area. She has not seen a doctor about it yet.

                                                Day of vaccine I felt perfectly fine. The next day i woke up with a swollen arm and very painful every time i loved it. Injection site was hot to the touch and it felt like a knot was under my skin. around 10:00am I began to feel feverish all over my body. I began to have the chills and began to feel tired. My body was achy as well and a headache developed. I slept from about 12:30PM to 6:30 PM and took acetaminophen at that time. Feverish feeling and chills broke after pill got into my system. Arm is still in major pain.

                                                On March 30th I developed a raised, swollen red patch at injection site and another raised red patch above. 12 hours later the rash began to itch.

She described it as &#34;swallowing cotton balls&#34;, then &#34;a large lump in her throat&#34;, then &#34;narrowing of her throat so that it felt as if she was breathing through a closing straw.&#34; Patient was having an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. I (the pharmacist) administered an EpiPen once, then 50mg diphenhydramine IM, and called 911. Patient was evaluated by EMS and brought to the hospital for observation.

Around day 14, I noticed a rash that was about 2 in x 1 in. I asked my provider about putting anything on it, but she said not. It lasted about 3 days and resolved. Had 2nd dose and experienced basic symptoms.

                                                I received my first Covid - 19 vaccine on March 25, 2021. The next day I felt extremely dizzy starting around 4:00pm. This was able to be resolved by increasing hydration. The following morning I felt much better with no other side effects. Just over a week later (4/2/21) I woke up around 7:00am and noticed a rash around the injection sight. It is not itchy but it feels warm and hard to the touch. The shape is somewhat of an irregular  oval about two inches long and an inch wide. I also have a smaller circular spot just below the larger spot. The rash is currently only located on my left arm right near the injection site.

Chills subsided enough to allow me to sleep in an hour and 30 minutes. Still experiencing mild left arm pain (concentrated to the injection site now), a 101.5 degree fever, mild chills, body aches, and now I have fatigue and a headache. I have not taken any medication.

This spot turned into hard red bump with a hight temperature that was painful to the touch. Over the course of the next 10 days, the bump increased in size until it was about 5 inches in diameter. On day 9, the swelling and hardness went away but the arm became numb. On day 10, arm feels heavy and sluggish, but the spot has begun fading away from red but is showing a purplish tint growing in it&#39;s spot.

Laying on that affected side is where it hurt. I woke up - vomited twice - nauseous; did visit through insurance on Saturday, the 23rd  - at 8:30 am and Dr. prescribed Zofran for the nausea. Other symptoms: fatigue, headache and fever. Highest temp was 102.9. I only give myself Tylenol when my temperature when my temp is over 102. I took Ibuprofen as needed for the fever - helped the fever to go down. Mid Sunday, the lymph node started - on the left side of my  neck and also under the armpit of that side. It was a quarter coin size of swelling under the armpit. For that I was drinking water and putting warm compress on the affected areas. The first symptoms lasted 3 days (resolved Monday). The lymph node swelling resolved Tuesday.

                                                About three hours after my shot I developed severe muscle cramps in my lower back all the way up to my mid back, this pain lasted 24 hrs. Around 5pm the day after my shot I had a 101 degree fever, a headache and still the severe back pain. I took Tylenol when I noticed I had a fever and went to sleep. I felt much better on Saturday the 10th, two days after my covid shot, but I did notice redness around the injection sight and still had a slight headache and fatigued.

                                                This patient received her first Moderna vaccine in the right deltoid at approximately 6:45pm on 4/19/21, and left the pharmacy around 7pm. By 7:30pm, she had developed a red rash over her chest, neck, and arms. This rash eventually became very itchy and she developed a bad headache. The patient was advised to take Benadryl liquid, which she did. When her lips began to feel tingly, she was advised to go to an urgent care facility. At urgent care, she was also given Pepcid and told to continue the Benadryl. By the next morning, the itching and redness had lessened some, but she still has the bad headache.

                                                About 6 hours after getting my second vaccine, I began feeling itchy (around 5:30 PM CST). I began breaking out in hives everywhere on the body (started in arms, then legs, stomach, chest, backside, EVERYWHERE except the face). At first I wondered if it could be from the outside like allergies but I have never experienced anything like this. I became itchy everywhere and had red little bumps all over and would get bigger if I scratched it. This continued from Friday evening, ALL DAY Saturday and Sunday. I made a telehealth appointment with a doctor regarding this because nothing I did would alleviate the itchiness. I was prescribed two antihistamines: cetirizine and prednisone. I only took the cetirizine Monday night and while it did relieve the itchiness, the effect wore off and to this day (Tuesday evening) I am STILL breaking out in hives.

I took a benadryl and took a nap around 1pm woke up at 4 pm with more hives. I bought Allegra and put calamation lotion on the hives and tried to sleep them off for the next day, on 4/10/21 when I woke up I had severe hives all over my body except for my stomach area, I went to the urgent care and the dr recommended I go to the ER which I was prescribed Prednisone and Hydroxyzine and to take Benadryl when needed. The ER doctor suggested it could be good, detergent, or a different shampoo. But I have never been allergic to anything in my life and have not changed anything and it just so happens I get hives after getting the vaccine.  Now today on 4/20/21 I broke out in mild hives around 2:30 am, took an Allegra and it seems to be gone for now. I hope this is not a reoccurring symptom..

                                                Woke up this morning (one week after first dose) with a  big red mark on my upper bicep that was warm to the touch. The area was swollen, as well as the under arm (lymph node?). Red mark has gotten larger over the course of the day, still swollen, tender, and hot to the touch. No other side effects, other than neck and hip pain the Monday after, but I am unsure it is related. The neck pain limited movement when trying to turn my chin over my right shoulder. The joint pain has gone away.

It came back about eight days after the shot. It was a baseball sized lump under the shot and it was more itchy and tender to touch. I went to the doctor they advised Advil, Ice and Benadryl. I tried those things and it went away after a few days. I got the second shot in the same arm, but I had no problems with my arm.

Fever persisted for approximately 12 hours, despite taking an over the counter fever reducer.  After this, I developed nausea and was unable to eat much for approximately 4-5 days. Being worried that I had contracted COVID before the vaccine, I got a rapid test the day after symptoms began. The COVID test came back negative. On Friday I developed a red, stinging, itching rash on the injection arm. The rash lasted for several days. During this time I also developed joint pain and fatigue. An abnormal amount of fatigue lasted more than a week after the vaccine.

                                                The day after my shot I got hives all over my body. They were giant hives. I started to take allergy medication to help with the irritation but it wasn&#39;t going away. I then called the place I got the vaccine and they hadn&#39;t reached back out to me in a timely manner so I did a virtual appointment. I then was prescribed some sort of Steroids for 5 days. I still have the hives mostly on my back and stomach. The hives are very hot but not ichy, just hurt to touch.

                                                Arm pain, arm swelling, bruising at the site of the injection, loss of grip strength in injection arm, all within 10 minutes of vaccination. Within a few hours, tiredness set in, additional loss of grip strength in both hands, but especially in the arm that received the vaccination. 9 hours after the shot, severe fatigue set in, as well as hot and cold flashes, switching between fever and chills, headache, excessive sweating, weakness, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, body aches, skin pain, and flare-ups of old injuries. I woke with tremendous, debilitating neck pain as well, which was the site of previous whiplash injuries, in both my neck and lower back, and my knees hurt as well. Woke every hour or so throughout the night, severe symptoms. By the next morning after the shot, the fever and chills had stopped, as well as the nausea and vomiting. Fatigue remained, headache on and off, and body aches. By day 3 most symptoms had gone away except for tiredness. By day 4 I started to notice sun sensitivity, and on day 6 have developed what seems to be a heat rash? My forearms are hot, red, sensitive, and reactive as well. Every day since the shot I have gotten tired in the afternoon as well, even if earlier in the day I felt OK. Have had mild shortness of breath in addition, but nothing that has stopped me from regular activity. As a 25 year old, I experienced incredibly severe symptoms, and this was my first shot of Moderna. No known previous exposure to Covid, either. Noticed that symptoms started worsening rapidly around 6 p.m. the day of my shot after taking my borth control pill as well. Wondering if related, or possibly coincidence.

Spread to round patch the next day and faded after that. Googled and description matched known possible side effect known as ?covid arm.? It faded entirely by Monday April 26. I took an antihistamine (cetrizine) every day starting the day I noticed the patch and monitored myself for further issues possibly related. I?ve had a headache, but that could be for any number of reasons not related to the shot.

It started on my right on where I received vaccine and has now spread down both arms, my legs, feet, hands, back of neck, and chin. They are extremely uncomfortable and itchy. It?s been 12 hours since my shot, and rash has only gotten worse. Benadryl and Hydrocortisone Cream isn?t helping much.

                                                4/19 I developed severe hives/rash all over my skin and inside my throat. I felt weak and tired. My throat was also swollen. This reaction is still continuing today 4/30, and I do  not know when it will end. I have been to urgent care twice for steroids, I have taken Benadryl, and Zyrtec but nothing will fully get rid of the reaction. I visited an allergist on 4/29 and she believes that I am having an adverse reaction to the vaccine. She prescribed several antihistamines to counter my reaction to the vaccine, including bendaryl, famotidine, fexofenadine, zyrtec, and an epipen incase my throat starts to close.

                                                Woke up this morning to my hands covered in rough, dead, peeling skin.  It doesn?t hurt much, but it?s really weird. I tried exfoliating and immediately using a moisturizer but it didn?t help at all. The flaking has gotten worse as the day has gone on.

                                                I started to feel symptoms 9 days after my first shot. I woke up to the normal soreness from the injection, but it was itchy and had a few small warm bumps. Throughout the night into the following next two days the site grew from quarter size to 4-6?, with hotness, itching, redness and slight pain.  I took Benadryl and ibuprofen once daily  to help with the itching and pain, and it seems the rash peaked on Saturday, May 23rd, and started to go away drastically by  Sunday, May 24th, evening, with little to almost no rash  Monday, May 25th.

The red circle is raised and tender to touch and very warm.  Additionally I noticed several tiny speckled bruises on my body. Some on my chest and some under my arm. I also have a swollen tender left eye lid. My eye could be vaccine related or not, I just noticed it the morning after I got the shot.
