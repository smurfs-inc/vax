                                                Client came to be vaccinated accompanied by her father on Saturday January 23, 2021. The greeting table in the front was very busy and a lot going on. The client had registered online and had her paper to prove it when she was escorted to he next tables to be registered. There was nothing adverse about her registration form. Date of birth was listed, however, it was not caught that she was less than 18 to receive Moderna. We advertise that it is the Moderna vaccine that we have. Father never said anything and stood off to the side waiting for her to be observed for 15 minutes. On Monday, January 25, I spoke with client who answered phone, to explain what happened and to see if she was OK. States her arm at injection site hurt a little, but nothing else. I said I would call each day to make sure she was OK. Later in the day, she left a message to call her. I called and she wanted to know what vaccine she would get as her second dose. I said it would not be Moderna and that I could find some information and call her back. Then she states she has a lawyer and to whom should she address it to. I said the Health Officer at the city.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

The next day more hives appeared on knees and the ones on feet got worse.  The day after that hives also appeared on hips and elbows.  On 1/27 went to Doctor&#39;s office and received steroid shot to stop the allergic reaction. Took 5-7 days for all the hives to disappear. Based on the allergic reaction to the first dose, doctor recommended not taking the second dose as reaction could be more severe and/or have an asthma attack.

Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

                                                18 year old female came to hospital for chest tightness, choking sensation in the throat as well as skin rash after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.  Initially patient presented to emergency room but subsequently discharged on steroid and Benadryl.  Patient had continued episode of choking as well as chest tightness and skin rash for that patient came back to emergency room.  Patient had received total 5 doses of epi pen because of that.  Patient was admitted to medical floor initially.  Patient was given steroid, Benadryl and famotidine.  Patient had 2 episodes on medical floor where she started feeling choking and chest tightness.  Patient remained stable hemodynamically except for tachycardia.  Patient was transferred to intensive care unit for close monitoring.  D-dimer was negative, urine tox screen was negative, COVID-19 PCR was negative, EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  CT scan of neck was negative.  We had discussed that patient has remained stable hemodynamically in the intensive care unit and discharge planning was discussed and patient was getting ready to be discharged when she had another episode where after drinking soda patient started having that choking sensation, patient remained stable hemodynamically during this episode as well.  Her symptoms had improved.  She looked visibly anxious.  Patient was monitored in the ICU for few more hours and patient remained stable.  I checked back on her and she was able to eat her lunch.  She probably had a allergic reaction to more than a vaccine but subsequent episodes are thought to be secondary to anxiety attack given situation.

She noticed a reaction about 10 days later, and it presented as a red rash on her body. This rash did get worse after the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine on 2/1/21. The rash is red and raised and does itch. It is all on 4 extremities, her abdomen, and her back. It is on her face, and on her scalp. She did a telehealth visit with an MD who prescribed her steroid cream. This did not help, and she has a dermatology appt on 3/30/21.   I wish there was a way I could upload pictures because what I am describing does not do it justice. Her entire body is covered with this rash, and it is causing her a lot of discomfort. She did state the red, raised areas bleed if she scratches them, which she avoids trying to do.

One week from the date of my vaccine, I woke up with a swollen and red arm below the injection site. It was itchy and painful. This has persisted for two days and I saw a physician for it. We are currently monitoring the site for possible cellulitis.

                                                One week after the shot  (1-14-2021) Patient (19 y.o.)reported side pain and appeared constipated, Laxatives given along with Tylenol, on further assessment  Patient was noted to have left leg redness and abdominal fullness.   Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

No drainage at site.  The Wheal reminds me of an old smallpox  vaccine scar.

Patient presents on 1/27/2021 after onset of pain, decreased ROM ongoing since administration.  I was able to visualize ecchymotic area where vaccine was administered and patient has photo evidence.  The physician responsible for the vaccine administration needs to be retrained on where to give deltoid muscle IM injections and to avoid the extremities where recent surgeries occurred (patient had right shoulder labrum repair in October 2020)

She cam back in side the room and we had a nurse assess her, her BP and heart rate were a  little elevated. We gave her some water and had her sit for some extra time while we talked to her. She has a child hood trauma regarding vaccine and had just had a major panic attack before and during her vaccination. We were all  pretty sure she had just worked her self up and was not feeling well because of that and she said as much herself. After about 15-20 more minutes her BP and heart rate were back to normal and although still feeling a little weak she was ready to go home with her mother.

                                                It started with bad arm pain at the site of injection. I went to bed around 12:30 but I couldn?t fall asleep. By 3am I figured the only reason I wasn?t sleep was from the vaccine. I then started to feel extremely nauseous and had chills. At 3:30 am I took my temperature and it was 100.5. I laid in bed until 5am with no sleep still and took my temperature again and it was 103.5. I went back into my bed and fell asleep around 5:30 am. The next day I felt as though I had been hit by a truck. I felt extremely groggy and achy and my temperature when I woke up was around 100. Overall, I felt awful.

She ended up going to the local ED - since she was still very fatigued and was feeling like she was going to pass out - blood work and U/S done - this is where she found out she had been pregnant but had lost the pregnancy (no heart beat).  Per her report - all other blood work was unremarkable.  No other medications given to her during this visit and was just told that she would be &#39;passing the products of conception within this next week&#39;.

                                                7 to 8 days after shot I have been getting an allergic reaction in the left arm (where I received the shot) to the left of the injection site and slightly below. It comes and goes but will flare up and become itchy at random times.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

                                                On the night I received the COVID-19 vaccine, I had a fever that went up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. In the morning 24 hours after I had the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I felt a little better from the night&#39;s fever and ate instant ramen, oranges, acetaminophen, and a vitamin C tablet. This was at about 8:45 AM. A few minutes or a minute after I swallowed the acetaminophen and vitamin C, I got a severe allergic reaction that led to me going to the Emergency Room. I have eaten these things before and am not allergic to acetaminophen, vitamin C, or anything in the instant ramen. The reaction was first felt by a shortness of breath and I could barely breath. Then, hives started to form on my face and my lips and face became extremely swollen. I then ended up throwing up after my mom gave be a Benadryl pill and I drank another Benadryl after.  My face had become less swollen but it was still difficult to breath and hives started to form all over my body so we decided to rush to the Emergency Room. We got to the Emergency Room at about 9:30 AM and the hives on my body were worse. They were able to calm down the reaction by giving me more Benadryl through an IV and steroids. They knew I had the second dose of the vaccine so they did not give me anything that would suppress my immune system. Timewise, it could be the acetaminophen, but I have taken acetaminophen in the past many times before without a reaction.

                                                My entire face was covered with hives. Within 2 hours of the vaccine I developed hives to the bilateral aspect of my face, forehead, cheeks and eyelids. My hives were itchy and red and I have never experienced this before. I did not consume any new food or use any new products. I took Benadryl for the itchiness. I had a telemedicine visit and I also had a Covid-19 test which was negative. I called health and also reported this adverse reaction. Moreover, I had no reaction to my second dose which was on 01-28-2021.

                                                I developed a very large, swollen lymph node under my left axillary.  I have never before had a swollen lymph node in either axillary regions of my arm. It was very painful, I could barely put my arm down because of the pressure of it pressing against the side of my body at rest. It has gotten better, there isn?t as much pain but it is still uncomfortable. The lymph node was/is palpable, and hurt upon touch and rest. The pain was an 7/10, but has now gone down to a 2/10. My arm is also still sore from the injection site, but it is not bad.

                                                Around 2:30-3pm I began feeling tired. I went to lay down and rest and started to get chills and a bad headache along with hot and cold episodes.   I started to sweat but had no fever at the time. This continued all night. I had no appetite after receiving my vaccine. Around 6:30 I started to get a fever of 100.3 and continued chills with headaches. I took Tylenol when needed. My whole body was sore throughout the day and got worse are the night progressed. My fever was in and out but around 9pm I had the highest temp of 101.4. I didn&#39;t get good sleep due to feeling unwell all night. I belive I stared feeling more myself sometime around 9:34am. But was still feeling a bit warm. But felt way better as the day progressed. My left arm where I received my shot is still very sore. And I still don&#39;t have an appetite.

I went to the doctors, he prescribed a steroid, the rash lightened however  back pain started, accompanied with stomach aches. Now I have a heaviness on my chest that hurts. It feels like my rib cage or my bones hurt.

Approximately 2 hours later, she began developing a reddened area on her arm at the injection site which was hot to touch and became itchy.  She reached out to our onsite nurse on 08MAR21.  She iced the area and took Benadryl.  She was told to follow-up with our onsite nurse if her condition didn&#39;t improve.  On 10MAR21, she reported she has been taking Benadryl HS and the area is &#34;almost completely cleared up.&#34;

                                                1 week after recieving the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, I bumped my right arm about 2 inches below the injection site. Throughout the course of the day, my arm progressively became swollen and sore, to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it much or sleep on it. The next day it got progressively better on its own, and then I began taking an antibiotic prescribed by my doctor that helped it heal the rest of the way. I&#39;m not positive if the rest of the healing was on its own, or directly because of the antibiotic.

On 3/12/21, she started feeling jaw pain on same side of injection and shoulder pain intensified plus numbness.  Patient says the pain and numbness  comes and goes. She is due for her next  dose on Saturday, March 28 but decided to wait  a little bit longer before she gets her second dose.

I sat with her for about 30 to 40 minutes to make sure she was maintaining normal breathing.  She did take some oral Diphenhydramine as was very itchy and red. She did have friend with her and we instructed her to go to ER if got worse.  Next day 3/24/21 patient called and said she had a productive cough and was advised by staff pharmacist to go to Dr.  She called back and said did go to Dr. and was prescribed steroids and antihistamine (was on steroid at time of vaccination but we were unaware) and Dr told patient not to get 2nd vaccination. Patient was doing better but not completely recovered

Diet and environment are unchanged. I?m on immunosuppressants I don?t know if this would effect or be related to my hives. I?m on day 3 of having them and I?m not sure if it?s related to the vaccine.  My doctor prescribed a weeks worth of steroids to see if it would have any affect of the hives.

It was hot, raised and itchy and about an inch and a half wide and long. I drew a line around it. The next day it was less itchy and hot but had gone about half an inch outside the initial lines. The third/ fourth day it was barely raised at all but had gotten even larger, now about 1.5-2inches outside the initial lines in some areas. It is now barely raised, barely red and has not gotten any larger since yesterday.

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

On 1/6/21, the rash worsened, resulting in patient going to the ER. Benadryl was prescribed and she was told to follow up with her primary MD.

Pt also reports that she experienced headache that started 3 hours post vaccination and lasted 3 full days (but she does suffer from chronic headaches).

                                                Pt reported that at about 7pm the day of her vaccine she developed a rash on her left arm/leg. It was itchy and so she took a Benadryl. She said her &#34;throat felt thicker&#34; but the Benadryl helped. She went to sleep and was fine. When she woke up the next morning on 1-6-2021 she reported the rash had spread. When she got to work and found me about 9:30 am to ask if that was normal I encouraged her to call her PCP and take a Benadryl. At that time she was having no difficulty breathing. She chose to call her PCP and not take a Benadryl as it makes her sleepy.  After she called her PCP she ended up leaving work. I found out later that her breathing had become labored and her neck/throat was starting to swell. Per her report, her PCP gave her epi and steroids, and R/X her an epi pen. She took her medicine and Benadryl around the clock and returned to work on 1-8-2021. When I spoke to her on that day she stated all of her symptoms had resolved, but her lymph nodes in her neck were still a little swollen.

                                                The first two days after injection it was painful to lift arm above 30 degrees and hurt upon palpation and I had an overall tiredness. A week after the injection on 1/13/2021 I developed a raised, red rash surrounding the injection site (2in x 4 in). The skin that was inflamed was 101.2 degrees fahrenheit.  The intense rash lasted around 24 hours and subsided after 3 treatments of Benadryl cream and one dose of oral Benadryl. The skin is still slightly raised and has a slight redness to it today (1/15/2021) but is much better than before.

Soon after in the evening the patient had rash and hives on her upper torso and neck.  The hives spread the next day to eventually cover her entire body.  The pt. took a Benadryl and went to the hospital because of the severity of the hives and itching on day 2.   The staff told her that she should use hydrocortisone cream and should possibly not get the second dose of the vaccination.  The pt. continued to use both the Benadryl and hydrocortisone the following day, but still the hives persisted.   Pt. is on Day 4 and will let us know further details on her condition as time goes on.

                                                A little over a week after receiving the vaccine I have developed a rash around the injection site. It is a circular rash that is slightly raised, mildly itchy, and warm. I am not experiencing pain.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine at 3:50pm on 01/25/2021. Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

The injection site was swollen and red in addition to general muscle pain from the shot.  This continued until about 48 hours after the vaccination.

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

I went back into the room and still couldn&#39;t breathe so they sat me down and told me my whole body was bright red and they stuck me with an epipen. The whole reaction probably lasted a  little less than a minute from the time it happened to when they stuck me with the epipen.

She also stated that it felt like her tongue was too big for her mouth. She also stated that it looked like there was a mosquito bite at the site of administration. She took a benadryl (unknown strength) about 1 hour after developing the breathing symptoms, and an hour later, she was starting to feel better. As of 24 hours after, the administration site reaction is not resolved.

                                                After 8 days of my shot (today), I noticed I was pretty itchy on my arm at the injection site. When I finally got a good look at it, it was red and had, what seems to be, little hives around it. It?s also a little tiny bit swollen at that area. Very warm to the touch and I can now feel this continuous, residual heat around it now that it?s later on in the day.   Since it?s only the first day I noticed it, the size of the area is still rather small. I don?t know if it will progress to be any bigger than it is now or if its appearance will change in the future.

Then, on Feb 13th a rash started to reappear that was warm to the touch and itchy and burning. I applied cortisone but rash on injection site kept growing. On Feb 14th, I woke up and rash was a bit smaller but every two hours I would have a tingling sensation like when your foot falls asleep but it went up my shoulder and back area up to my neck and occurred every 2 hours. I then was advised to take claratin, add more cortisone, and take Benadryl as well. The itchiness stoped. My rash is still there but it?s very light compared to feb 13th.

This was NOT wittnessed; she does NOT recall passing out or hitting her head. A co-worker noticed something wasn&#39;t right &amp; had her sit down. They called my wife who picked her up &amp; brought home &amp; rested. Approximately 5.5 hours later, after feeling &#34;better,&#34; she got up to get something to eat. While returning to bed (to rest &amp; eat the small container of applesause) she felt as though she were going to pass out again &amp; quickly sat down on the steps. However, she did not call for me (I was in the room nextdoor) for a few minutes... seemingly having &#34;zoned out&#34; but she does not think she lost consciousness.

Most of the swelling went down after 24 hours, but 4 days later I still have a very large rash that extends from my shoulder to my elbow. It is red and has clear borders. It is still itchy and slightly warm.

She felt better after 30 minutes and proceeded to go eat in her bedroom.  She was nervous and anxious prior to the vaccine and states that she thought that had something to do with it.  She then experienced a 10 second bout of muscle tension in her face and jaw which caused her to be unable to talk or speak for a few seconds.  She was brought back down to the hall for evaluation.  She felt as if she was having a stroke and that got her more worked up.  She denies lower body weakness.  She states that her head feels heavy and she complains of general fatigue.  No n/v.  No headache or blurry vision.

Hives were symmetrical in nature and mirrored a ?covid rash? or urticaria. Swelling intensified even while on Benadryl. Only steroid began to help diminish redness after 24 hours on 80mg of prednisone.   Began 3/10, worsened exponentially until taking prednisone on 3/13. Now (3/14) healing but still experiencing itchiness and red bumps.

This lasted until I woke up the next day, about 40 hours after the shot, I felt physically weak the next day and still had arm soreness at the site of injection but no pain, headache, fever, or chills (3/14). Felt completely back to normal, still some slight pain on the arm at the site of injection, about 64 hours after the shot (3/15).

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had a really awful headache and swollen arm, that was incredibly touch-sensitive. Around 3 pm that day, 25 hours after the injection I was hit with severe nausea. About an hour later, I began vomiting and had diarrhea. For some time, I was unable to keep water down. I called a 24-hour nurse line, and they advised contacting my doctor&#39;s emergency line. I did, they said if I couldn&#39;t make it through the night without keeping water down I needed to go to the hospital. Luckily, right before bed I drank some water and was able to make it through the night. The next morning, I had a telehealth visit with someone from my doctors office to review symptoms. Today I have had waves of nausea, but no vomiting. I have had diarrhea, and I had a spontaneous period that was very heavy and two weeks early today (2 days post vaccine).

I slept with my mom in fear of having episode again. Around 2:45 am, my mom woke to me shaking like I was having a seizure. it lasted about 30 secs. she called 911 and i was checked out by paramedics, who said my vitals were fine and I should flollow up with medical care. My mom and I agreed that perhaps I needed stress dosing of Cortef. I took stress dosage and have been taking stress dosage all day and so far no more episodes.  Now waiting for Doctor to call me back and advise.

The next day (2.5 days after the vaccine), I was feeling better other than some soreness in my injection site.

                                                Minutes after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, patient complained of difficulty breathing.  I asked if she was wheezing and she said no.  A doctor in the clinic came over and even though it wasn&#39;t time for patient and her sister to leave (based on 15-minutes after receiving the vaccine) he initially suggested that they might be fine to go, but after patient told him of her symptoms and at my urging he decided to have her stay a little longer.   I think it was at this time that he had someone check her pulse.  I don&#39;t know what the pulse reading was.  He stepped away and shortly afterwards patient started complaining that her throat felt strange and was making it hard to breathe.  The doctor immediately came back over, found patient was having difficulty breathing and holding herself upright in the chair.  I held her by the shoulders to keep her from falling while the doctor also steadied her and asked a worker in the room for an epi-pen.  The worker didn&#39;t seem to react much to the request so he told her louder that he needed an epi-pen.  She started searching her area and the doctor started yelling across the room to others that he needed an epi-pen.  It seemed like others initially took the demand less urgently than they should, but eventually someone came with an epi-pen.  By this time I don&#39;t think patient was very conscious, if at all.  Sometime during this time the doctor also instructed someone to call 911.  The doctor tried using the epi-pen but at first he had some kind of cap on it that prevented it from working.  He removed the cap and not finding an easy way to have a sterilized injection site he injected the epi-pen through patient&#39;s jeans.  Soon afterwards a cot was brought out and workers had me step aside as they took patient and put her on the cot.  Patient seemed to gradually become more aware of her surroundings and it wasn&#39;t long before she appeared to me to be fully conscious once again.  They checked her blood pressure and pulse and maybe did other tests during this time.  Eventually the ambulance arrived and patient was very clear with everyone that she did not want to incur the expenses of riding in the ambulance and I offered to bring her wherever they suggested that she should go.  They watched and evaluated her for a while and eventually had her sign the form declining the ambulance transportation.  They suggested that she make an appointment with her doctor but did not suggest that we take patient to an emergency room.  We departed and patient did not afterward  seem to experience any symptoms from the vaccine other than some of the general feelings of being sick, soreness at the injection site, etc. that others report with the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Reaction started out with a localized 3-4 inch inflamed reaction. It looked very similar to hives. This was on Friday, March 19th, 2021 around 9 PM. I went to sleep and woke up the next morning and it was still there. I took benadryl and one ibuprofen to help the inflammation and the reaction, but it only got worse following this. I then had intense tactile and mechanical allodynia, which is often associated with my diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but this has been very intense. The allodynia had been occurring across my left hand up to my elbow, but has now moved to both of my arms, my neck, my entire back (more severely around the ribs), my chest, and my feet. I am very fatigued and feel feverish. My current temperature is only 99.2, but the pain is still active. Today is Sunday, March 21st, 2021. I got the vaccine on Saturday, March 13th, 2021 and this reaction is following the vaccine about a week after.

                                                The syringe was larger and looked full. It took a long time for medication to go into the arm due to the amount of liquid injected into the muscle.  Right away the full left arm and breast were painful.  The arm pain continued to get worse and felt like she hit her funny bone but more extreme and this pain lasted all night into the next day.  She was unable to sleep due to the full arm pain.  The significant pain in the breast area lasted all day into the next day too. Also, felt chills and body aches starting that evening into the next day and night. We did not know the dose was only supposed to be 0.5 ml at the time of injection. We suspect she received at least 5 ml instead of the recommended 0.5ml.The name of the nurse that administered the vaccine is written on the vaccine card but not sure of spelling. RN?

                                                First day I had immediate swelling at the injection site, red circle form around the site of injection following up with an itch that lasted for 3 days. Along on those immediate symptoms I got the injection on my right arm and I experienced pain shooting up from my right arm into my neck and currently still have those pains from time to time when I move my right arm at an elevated angle. Day 4 of the vaccine I woke up one morning with swollen glands, congestion, swollen nasal glands, low grade fever of 100 degree F, very itchy irritated throat and hard to swallow, visited a clinic to see if I possibly had flu or strep but all my test results returned negative, also I had a covid test done and it was negative, I have never contracted covid 19 prior to vaccine and current day. Additionally, symptoms of congestion worsened and I am now experiencing some laryngitis due to the swelling of my lymph nodes, only sinus medication lessens the congestion to manage, I feel very fatigue, and experiencing some migraines.  Today only marks 1 weeks since the vaccine

                                                I received an allergy immunotherapy shot the day before my first dose of the vaccine and instantly felt nauseous and extremely tired after receiving the vaccine, which continued for two days after receiving tut. Three days later, I woke up struggling to breathe (but not anaphylactic), covered in hives, itchy all over, shaking, disoriented, and chilled but not truly feverish.  I reported this to my allergist, who prescribed prednisone and suggested the vaccine combined with immunotherapy were too much for my immune system for one week. The hives, itchiness, and difficulty breathing lasted about four days. I struggled with fatigue and nausea for over two weeks, stopping all school and work in the meantime. After my second dose, I feel just a bit tired and sore, so I think this truly was a bad reaction to the two injections combined rather than to the vaccine itself. Still, it was a debilitating experience,  and I would recommend considering putting out guidance that other immunotherapy patients space out their allergy injections and vaccines farther than I did.

                                                Fainting; Injection site soreness in arm; nauseous; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer  concerning a 21-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced, fainting (syncope), injection site soreness in arm (vaccination site pain), and nausea (nausea).  The patient&#39;s medical history included vasovagal condition that cause heart rate and blood pressure to drop due to stress on body and dehydration resulting in fainting. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 09 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 09 Feb 2021, the patient was fine until about 11 pm after which she experienced arm soreness on the injection site and felt nauseous.   On 10 Feb 2021, at 5 am in the morning, the patient fainted. The patient assumed that shot might have added stress to her body which most likely caused her to faint.   No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the event as patient would be receiving second dose on 09 Mar 2021.  The outcome of events, fainted (syncope), injection site soreness in arm (vaccination site pain), and nauseous (nausea), were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events of syncope, vaccination site pain, and nausea, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

Rash will dissipate and reappear 1-2 times daily since initial formation. Very itchy. Exclusive to the deltoid muscle where the vaccine was injected.

The next morning 12/29/2020 I woke up with a migraine and still had severe pain in my arm. That night (12/29/2020) I began feeling aches and pains throughout my body and felt that into the next morning (12/30/2020). The evening of 12/30/2020 I noticed a dollar coin sized red spot on my arm that was warm to the touch and was slightly raised. (By this time my arm pain had decreased but was still present.) The red spot had grown slightly by 12/31/2020 but not much. Friday 01/01/2021 I hadn&#39;t payed much attention to the spot but it looked the same. The morning of 01/02/2021 I woke up and had noticed that the spot had taken over a large portion of the outer bicep on my right arm.

On 12/28/2020 noticed the pain was back and I now have a medium sized lump in my armpit that was causing pain. On 12/31/2020 began to have a rash around the injection site that was increasing in size and limiting arm mobility. PCH EH sent CG to WorkMed and CG was given Rx for Keflex which was completed on 01/07/2021--CG stated symptoms are greatly improve.

                                                I received the Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/29. I had some minor swelling and soreness the first couple days after receiving the vaccine, but these symptoms both went away after a couple of days. A week later on 1/5, I noticed that the area where I had been injected was very swollen, red and itchy. It was localized to this year. There was some slight bruising around the top of where the swelling started. The area was not sore. There is still some redness and itching on 1/7 but the swelling has mostly gone down. I work in a community health center and had a PA I work with look at the reaction. I took some Benadryl as directed on 1/5 but have not treated the symptoms further.

                                                Immediately after vaccination, the upper left arm had a small welt and the arm and shoulder.was very painful--she was unable to lift her arm. The next day, she was quite ill; she was extremely fatigued and slept  20 hours. The following day the symptoms disappeared. A week later the site of the vaccination became hot and a welt began to form. A day later, the welt expanded and is continuing to expand and is currently 3 inches in diameter. She is experiencing fatigue additionally. *Please note that her menses have begun 2 weeks before it should.

Used HCT cream TID and took zyrtec 10 mg at work yesterday. The rash looks a lot better today. Not itchy anymore.  The area is tender but not as red as it was. No discharge/pus.  No numbness or tingling.  T97.6  Pt denies any other sxs except for SOB for about 30 min intervals over the first 2-3 days after the vaccine. Pt checked pulse ox when feeling short of breath and it was 96%. She states she&#39;s not sure if it was from anxiety.

                                                I developed a swollen supraclavicular lymph node above my left collarbone. It appeared just a few days after receiving the vaccine. No other side effects were noted aside from a sore arm and some itchiness around the injection site that lasted for 5 days after getting the vaccine. The lymph node is still swollen but is not worsening or painful. My sore arm and the itchiness have improved and are no longer an issue.

                                                I recieved the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/5/21 and did not experience any adverse reactions in the days following. Then, on 1/13/21 (8 days post vaccine) I noticed hives covering most of my body. My face was tingling and my lips were swollen. I took an antihistamine that evening hoping it would go away. The day after 1/14/21 I woke up with the hives all over my body, especially on my face. They were very severe and itchy. I went to my dermatologist and they recommended a steroid cream and oral antihistamine to help reduce the itching. It is now 1/15/20, and the hives are still covering most of my body with severe hives on my face.

                                                For two days after my vaccine, I experienced only the normal discomfort at the site of injection. There was no redness and minimal swelling, and all symptoms had vanished completely after two days. However, one week after the injection date,  I experienced a renewal of discomfort at the site of injection, accompanied by swelling, redness, and itchiness. So far, these are my only symptoms. It has about 18 hours since these new symptoms appeared, and they seem to be improving slightly.

Those symptoms subsidized after 2 days. A week after the vaccine (1/19/2021), a lump appeared on my shoulder where the injection was done. The area is red, itchy and warm. Those symptoms have been observed for 2 days now.

                                                8 days after I received the moderna  vaccine, I noted a red, indurated rash/hive at the vaccine site. I was told by a provider that this delayed reaction was noted in some of the Moderna vaccine trials and given that I had no other symptoms (no fever, no warmth or signs of cellulitis) it would most likely go away in 3-5 days.  The next morning I woke up and my body was covered in hives. It is manageable with Benadryl. My roommate also had the exact same reaction, same timing, symptoms, etc and we both got the Moderna vaccine, same location, same lot, same time. Neither of us have allergies, and the other apartment mate has no symptoms (and has not received the vaccine).

She reported the itching resolved after the medications and then she is still complaining of breast pain.  She noticed 2 drops of fluid out of her right nipple.  I do not necessarily know that this is an allergic reaction I am just not sure what to make of the coincidence with the Covid immunization it could be entirely unrelated.  Advised follow-up with her PCP regarding these issues.  Return precautions discussed.  She verbalized agreement and understanding with plan of care.  Sent home from ED.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had gotten the these three red, circle marks on my left arm, below and diagonal from the injection site on Wednesday, 01/20/2021. On the 21st I noticed these three red circles grew to where they merged into one large spot. I drew a pen line around the spot to monitor the growth. Today, 22nd, I noticed it grew past the pen line. I have drawn another pen line around the new growth and will continue to supervise it. No itching, pain. A little heat from it.

I feel like a giant solid mass in my arm where I received the vaccine. I feel okay. I don&#39;t know if I have a fever.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

                                                One week after vaccination, there was swelling in the armpit of the same arm of injection. The swelling was tender, but went away after about 2 days. About 3-4 days later, a red, tender rash developed in the armpit of the same arm of injection. The rash is dry and burns to the touch. There is also a small patch of rash on the right armpit (not arm of injection). The rash on the left armpit completely covers the area.

Rash then spread across chest.  No itching, no pain.  No hives. She said her heart was racing when she first noticed rash but attributed this to anxiety.  Checked pulse and O2 Saturation about 10 minutes after symptoms began.  Pulse 88, O2 sat 98.  She was offered benadryl but declined.

                                                28 hours post vaccine I noticed a rash on my chest and upper back.   The rash was not raised and did not itch, but there was a mild tingling sensation to it.  40 hours post vaccine the rash  included my neck, stomach, upper back, and chest.   The rash was not raised and did not itch, but there was a mild tingling sensation to it.  The rash seemed to be the most intense between 40 to 44 hours post vaccine.  Following 44 hours post vaccine the rash began to gradually lighten and the tingling disappeared.  At 52 hours post vaccine the rash was barely noticeable in color with no tingling.

                                                Inflamed supraclavian lymph node and local site injection inflammation. Stated lymph node became inflammed the day after injection, which subsequently was misinterpreted by a physician as a potential aneurysm (pulsating mass), resulting in unnecessary hopsitalization. With reference to the site injection, left deltoid became red, itchy, and hot initally  surrounding local site only. However, as days progressed, reddening spread radially to extend to a final diameter of approxiamtely 5 inches, which also required medical intervention. I was presecribed steroids and anitbiotics which alleviated said symptoms. The symtpoms went away 3 weeks after first dose injection. Physicians advised against taking second dose.

The stiffness turned into nerve problems and I felt hot and tingly on my neck, back and head for several days. 8 days later from the vaccination day i got a huge rash on my left arm. On top of that my armpit area was severely sore . Soreness and pain from the arm continued 2 weeks later.

I advised her to call her doctor to get it checked out and to report and adverse events to the website (which I provided to her).

                                                Severe injection site pain (aching) approximately 3 hours after injection on 2/2. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 2200 to take the edge off of the pain in order to fall asleep. Beginning at 0600 on 2/3: Temp of 100 F, chills, body aches, headache. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 1000 which lowered temp and reduced other symptoms for approximately two hours. Symptoms returned at 1200 with temp reaching 100.2 F along with chills, headache, and body aches that were more intense in the shoulder/neck area. Used a heating pad along my back, shoulders, and neck which helped with the body aches. Slept from 1500 to 1800 and woke up with an intense frontal headache with pain shooting through my eyes as well. Temp was 100.7 F. Took 400 mg ibuprofen which made the symptoms more bearable. Tried to stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Also had two servings of soup. Symptoms seemed to lessen by 2200. The only symptoms lingering today, 2/4, are a slight headache, fatigue, and mental fog. Otherwise, condition has improved tremendously.

However, 10 days later, I started experiencing mild sore throat and fever, headaches, and moderate aches and muscle weakness. Day 11 after the vaccine, I noticed a red, asymptomatic ring around the injection site. I have never had a reaction to any vaccine or shot before. In total, I experienced fever, sore throat, muscle weakness, fatigue for 4 days after the symptoms started.

                                                At 6:30PM on 2/6 (29.5 hours after I received my 2nd Moderna vaccine dose), I developed a small cluster of hives on my left arm around the crease of my elbow (4-5 inches away from the injection site). The hives continued to spread outward until they covered about 25% of my arm 2-3 hours after the hives first appeared. This was the height of the pain/swelling/itchiness. The hives gradually moved upward along my arm and are currently an inch or two below my injection site (5 hours after the adverse effects began).

Taking an aspirin alleviated most of the symptoms to where I was more functional. I did call into work and skip a meeting the day after.

This lump went away after some time on its own.   Today, 02/06/21, the itchiness and pain returned, and what looked like a ?ridge? shape under my skin appeared on my arm at the site where the shot was administered.  It?s just bothersome but doesn?t impair my regular functionality. I intend to take a Benadryl and stay hydrated. Noticed I?ve been excessively thirsty today, much more than usual.

I developed hives on my forehead, cheeks, neck, chest, and arms. The fingers on both my hands and my lips were tingling.  Treatment: I was rushed to the ER and given an IV steroid, IV fluids (2 bags), and IV benadryl.   Outcome: All the reactions went away within 4 hours and I was discharged from the ER. I was advised to take benadryl for 48 hours afterwards as needed and given a 5 day course of prednisone; 2 tablets taken daily.

                                                I got my first dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine on Wednesday February 3rd. I was completely fine, definitely experienced a sore arm for 2-3 days. Noticed my injection site was pretty low to where you would normally put an IM injection. Also noticed, swelling locally around the injection site every day after getting the COVID vaccine. The j je tino site felt warm to the touch and was still swollen. Around Friday night, I started to get really itchy. Didn?t think much of it. Until I took a look on Saturday afternoon. My top half of my back, my neck and left ear where covered in small weird hives/bumps and was red and itchy. I took some Benadryl, and hoped it went away. It didn?t. Sunday morning my left ear was getting even more swollen, and this time the rash wasn?t all on my top back, but instead, traveled down my spine. This is when I decided to head to the ER since no urgent care was open, and they ruled it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave me a steroid and Benadryl injection IM, and am reporting this the morning after. I currently haven?t felt any itching or have noticed much swelling/redness. I think it?s also important to note that I?ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything, this my first ever, that I can recall.

Patient was monitored for 30 minutes and assessed before departure.

                                                The first couple of days I had a very sore arm and I couldn?t raise it above my stomach. That went away so I thought that it was fine, however, two days ago I looked in the mirror and I had a large red circle around the injection site. It is itchy, red, swollen, and sore. It has been over a week since I received the vaccine so I was a bit worried about it.

                                                The reaction is due to the SECOND dose in the series. I had a fever of 102.5 along with body aches, chills, etc, the day following the vaccine (2/9), but that resolved within 24 hours. The second day after was fine (2/10). The third day after I developed a deep red rash like pattern extending down my arm more than halfway down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was extremely high, just below the top of my shoulder and immediately below the body part of my shoulder, so the extent of the redness is ~6inches long.  It is extremely painful, warm to the touch, and slightly swollen. I went to the urgent care where I was diagnosed with cellulitis. I was prescribed doxycycline 100mg PO BID x5days. I am reporting this on the day of the reaction, and it is unknown how it will respond to the antibiotics or if it will get any worse.

                                                When the person had given me the shot, it was so painful and he had kept in my arm for a while. It was nothing like the first one. He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Pain in about 4 on a 1-10 scale. Feels mostly like a bruise is being pushed on. I do have very sensitive skin so it is probably a slight allergic reaction. The doctor did an awesome job with the shot (10/10 hope she does it again). I feel great other than my arm being a little sore. No fever, headaches, etc. My arm has get slightly tingly today but nothing concerning. Definitely not a bad enough reaction to deter from getting the 2nd dose! :D

I have taken Benadryl that helped significantly started taking on Friday(3/12/21). Lymph nodes are still swelling and injection area is starting to itch.

Right arm was consistently sore and hard to lift above head. About 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, my right arm, shoulder, upper back, hand, fingers, knee, ankle, foot, and toes all began to feel tight and lose sensation. By March 12, I was walking with a limp and struggled to move my right arm at all.

                                                My legs became very itchy at 11:30 pm on Monday 3/15/21. I woke up at 8 am on Tuesday 3/16/2021 and noticed a large rash covering my legs, from my feet all the way up to my hips. The rash was large and blotchy, I have had allergic reactions before but nothing like this one and it was extremely itchy. I called my primary physician and allergist, they said to go to an ER or urgent care. I went to an urgent care at 12 pm on 3/16/2021 where they gave me a 125 mg steroid shot and prescribed prednisone and .5% Triamcinolone. By about 3 pm the rash on my legs was mostly gone but left bruising. At 3 am on Wednesday 3/17/2021 I woke up with an extremely itchy neck and face, I went to see what was happening and noticed the same rash from the day prior now on my face and neck. I put the prescribed cream on and took Zyrtec and eventually went back to bed. I woke up at 6:30 am with extremely itchy sides. I went to check on my face and neck, but they were clear, now the rash was all over my shoulders, sides, back, and hips. I felt fine other than the rash, applied the cream and took the meds, and went to work. At work, I started to become itchier on my sides, lower back, and arms. I went to put more cream on and the rash on my stomach was worse as well as my arms were covered. At 1 pm my stomach, back, and sides were less itchy but the outside of my left leg was itchy and started to have the rash again. I went to my physician&#39;s office at 3:30 pm where she said there is nothing else that I can do but go to the ER because I have asthma and I described needing to take more energy to take a deep breath

                                                Vaccine was injected into my left arm muscle. I have a Nexplanon birth control implant in the same arm on the inside of my left arm. Within a few hours of getting the shot, the place on my arm where the implant is started burning and was blindingly painful to the touch. It felt like the implant was ripped out then re-inserted and was very tender. Symptoms persisted for 24 hours. I have no pain now. I assume it was from muscular swelling, but I think it is something to be aware of.

I have had horrible hives that are not allowing me to live my life without taking Benadryl around the clock for 6 days so far. I developed a bright red circle on my left arm where I got the vaccine on 6th day of rash. I went to the dermatologist and there was no treatment.  The hives come and go every few hours.

                                                About an hour or hour and half after getting  my vaccine, my head became all fuzzy as though I had just finished drinking three alcoholic drinks. I am not someone that can handle my alcohol very well so by that point I&#39;m really out of it. JUST TO BE CLEAR though I was NOT drinking alcohol. It&#39;s just a metaphor. I could not think clear and was having difficulty communicating beyond simple words. About 30 minutes after this all started, I made the decision to not drive for the rest of the day because I felt my reaction time had decreased substantially.  While all of the head stuff was happening, my arm was also hurting, which I expected. However, the pain didn&#39;t stay localized to my deltoid. Instead it radiated down my arm and into my hand. It felt as though my hand had been stabbed with a knife, so my entire arm hurt but the focal points were in my hand and the injection site. The next day the effects were gone but I had a headache. Not a bad headache but it wasn&#39;t localized to a single part of my head.

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

The patient also noted &#34;tingling&#34; in her right arm where she received the vaccine.  In addition, there was localized erythema at the injection site with about 5 cm in diameter.  I gave the patient 37 mg of Benadryl and the edema immediately was reduced in addition to the erythema resolved.  She had no more tingling.  I observed her for 30 minutes and all was fine with the patient.  I then checked on her 1 hour later and all was good.

                                                About 5:45 pm on Saturday, January 2, 2021 my inner left eye began to feel itchy and irritated like there was something in it. I touched my eye and rubbed it for approximately 30 minutes, but it still felt like I had something poking my inner eyelid. I looked in the mirror and saw my inner, upper, left eyelid was swollen and slowly getting worse. I tried applying a warm compress for 10 minutes, but it did not seem to help. I was getting ready for a shower and saw hives on my hips and inner thighs. I felt itchy in other places of my body as well. I saw hives on both of my upper arms, my back, and my neck. I took one 25 mg Benadryl and got in the shower. As I was showering, I felt my left upper lip begin to tingle and swell. I rushed to the ER immediately. I arrived around 7:25 pm. As I was waiting for the ER doctor, I noticed my lip and eye swelling were almost back to normal, but I still had hives and they were spreading. The ER doctor gave me Benedryl and Solumedrol in an IV around 9 pm. I left the ER around 10 pm. I had no more swelling on my eye and lip and my hives were slowly diminishing.

The itchiness and rash are new today, however a lump has been present since injection. The rash is directly above the lump. It may be unrelated, but I&#39;ve also been unusually drowsy (noticed before taking the benedryl).  I took benedryl and applied lotion to the rash. My pregnancy began July 4th and I was 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the vaccine. My estimated due date is March 25th, 2021. At the time of the adverse reaction, I am 29 weeks pregnant.

Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

The following day, the lump was still there, it was red and hot, but not painful. The redness had spread towards my chest but did not go past my armpit. The size of the lump has decreased since then, nearly gone today on 01/07/2021.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

Took 1 Aleve for the pain. Then on day 7 axillary pain went away and a rash started to form on arm where vaccine was given. Day 8 rash spread at was bright red. Around noon on day 8  hives popped up next to left eye. On day 8 did a virtual doctor appointment and the NP prescribed antibiotics because she said the &#34;rash&#34; is cellulitis.  At this time took zytec to help with the hives.

Left arm pain starting about 11 hours after shot. Difficult to move arm without intense pain and intense pain at the slightest touch of the arm on or around the vaccination spot. Starting the morning after the vaccination, my glands in my neck were tender and aching like they do when I?m fighting off a cold, I had body aches that you would get if you had a fever for the entire day all over my body. I took ibuprofen that night and they started to go away and I felt hot like I was breaking a fever. I woke up the next morning which is 2 days after the vaccination and felt completely back to normal besides residual arm pain. This pain is bearable and I can move my arm with only a dull pain and I can touch the spot without intense pain however it is still painful.

                                                On 1/4/2020 at roughly 07:00 PM, a dull ache started in my right arm where the vaccine was injected, it radiated from my right shoulder, to my right shoulder blade. My arm felt very heavy. There was also a small hard lump beginning to form with a little heat at the injection site. I had difficulty sleeping due to the aching pain. On 1/5/2020, I woke up at 06:30 AM, the lump had grown in size, and was much more red and hot to the touch, in an oval shape. By roughly 11:30 AM same day, it began to itch, I had checked it and the lump had raised significantly. Hot to the touch. The dull ache had begun radiating into my right armpit as well as down to my right elbow. By 06:00 PM, same day, the aching had continued,  the lump was still very raised, itchy, red, and hot. It looked like a large hive. By 06:30 AM on 1/6/2020, the dull ache had mostly subsided, my shoulder blade still felt uncomfortable. The itching continued. The redness spread in size, however the swelling of the lump had gone down slightly. By 06:30 AM on 1/7/2020, the lump had mostly gone down in size significantly, the dull ache had subsided completely, the redness had gone away. By 1/8/2020, 10:00 PM, the lump and swelling are gone, no ache, no itch, still a slight discoloration where lump was.

                                                Employee noticed bilateral hives on her lower legs on 01/05/2021. She took Benadryl and applied steroid cream with little resolution of her symptoms. She contacted her PCP who told her to seek evaluation at the urgent care. She went to the urgent care on 01/05/21 and was tested for COVID (negative) and was given an Rx for steroid cream. CG called me back on 01/07/21 stating that she now has developed a &#34;circular rash&#34; around her injection site, which her PCP was able to assess. The CG reports that her PCP told her she is ok to receive the second dose, but with close monitoring and to pre-medicate with Benadryl.

I had arm discomfort initially from the vaccine, but that when away.   I am on day 13 since injection. I feel normal other than the  red ring that continues to spread.  I have been taking photos and making the site.  The area inside the ring is warmer compared to my other deltoid on the right side. I am schedule for the next vaccine on the 1/26/21.  I just wanted to make sure I would still qualify to get the second dose/ safe? I can send pictures as well. I just wasn&#39;t able to attach an image.

By the next morning, rash expanded to 9.5 cm by 6.0 cm but was without pruritis or wheals. Denies additional areas of urticaria or associated symptoms. Denies previous history of allergies to vaccines.

                                                Around 9:00-9:30pm on Jan 16th (vaccination date of Jan 8th), I noticed my arm in the area of the injection site had swelled, turned red/pink, and felt itchy. Area is approximately 8mm in length and 4-6mm in height, irregular shape. Area feels tight, hard, and significantly warmer than remainder of arm. No fever, but site registers approximately 98F, which is above forehead temperature. Given my history of delayed reactions to insect bites, I felt reporting may be necessary. No medical treatment sought as of 10:05pm on Sat Jan 16th, but I will call primary care provider/urgent care center if symptoms worsen or if taking over the counter loratidine 10mg does not improve swelling, itching, and redness.

Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

                                                At first, immediately after the vaccination I felt super sore in my right arm and fatigued. Then after a few days, it went away. Now on 01/16/2021, I started getting a cough, a sore throat, a  fever, and extremely tired. Then the next day the symptoms got worse and now I had a stuffy nose, inner ear pain, nausea, muscle aches all over my body, dizzyness, and chills. This continued into Sunday and now Monday.

                                                Following the second phase around 5pm the intense feeling being extremely cold and despite being under 4 covers and a heated blanket I did not find relief. At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                Immediately following the vaccine there was nausea after eating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain which lasted about 8 days. 9 days after receiving the vaccine the injection site area got itchy, hot and swollen. Redness appeared about an hour after icing the area down. Benadryl was taken within 30 minutes of symptoms starting and swelling did go down moderately, but redness and heat from area remained. Today being day 10 after the vaccine, the redness, swelling, hot temperature and itching are still present. The area is about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide. Redness is in the shape of a ring with the center of the swelling area being white and the outer edges being red. None of the symptoms have worsened since day 9 and self care with Benadryl and icing is being continued.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, I had redness around the injection site and a sore arm for about 2-3 days. I received the shot on a Tuesday, and by the weekend my arm felt fine. One week later (Monday 25th), I felt like I had a light fever. My temperature was 99.1F. Tuesday, my left arm where I received the injection was SO SUPER itchy. When I looked at it, there was a huge, red, swollen, bump. The area was about the size of a credit card. The area was also HOT to the touch even though the rest of my arm felt like a normal temperature. From Tuesday 26th through Wednesday 27th (time of reporting), I still have the big, red, hot bump at the injection site, and my fever fluctuates in between 99.1-100.4F. I contacted my doctor who believes it is most likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He has advised me to take benadryl and tylenol, and if I still have the fever tomorrow, he will test me for strep, flu, and COVID. I have not taken the benadryl and tylenol long enough to see if there is any sort of impact. I should also mention that I get tested weekly for COVID at work, and my test from Monday January 25 has come back as negative.

Approximately one week after the vaccine, I developed hives at injection site. Hives turned into another welt that continued to spread until I was given steroids to take. The steroids did cause the reaction to stop and go away.

                                                Within about 20 minutes post injection, patient stated she felt &#34;itchy&#34;. I gave her diphenhydramine and she swallowed it. At about 30 minutes post injection, she stated she had small bumps on her bilateral arms. They were hard for me to discern but she also claimed the bumps were painful.  I asked about any labored breathing or chest tightening and she denied both. After about ~45-50, she still stated the same itchiness and pain. Visually there was no change in my opinion. Patient then conferred with  supervisors at her employment about her next steps. Her PCP was closed and she was deciding if she wanted to go to urgent care. That&#39;s the last interaction I had.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

                                                Starting 3 days ago (approximately 10 days after vaccine) I started having muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was given in similar to the soreness right after the vaccine was given.  A few hours after the soreness was noticed I noticed red-raised hives in the injection site. Over all symptoms (soreness to touch same as the soreness right after vaccine was given, itching, redness, raised hives, and warm to touch in the area of redness). The next day the symptoms remained about the same but area of raised-red-hives now seems to be a more defined 4-5 inch long red oval in the area the vaccine was given. 3rd day redness seemed lighter in color but still a pretty defined oval with warmness to touch the soreness was a little better by the 3rd day. I started taking Amoxicillin 500 mg that I had at home on the 3rd day. Today, 4th day, overall seems to be getting better still some soreness, still a red oval but is getting lighter, still soreness but defiantly better than it was. My doctor had me start Keflex 500 mg Q 6 hours for 7 days I started taking that today.

Currently taking Zyrtec to see if the hives go away - bumps all over arms, legs, back - itchy! Hives has been happening for 1-2 days so far.

                                                Moderate pain in injection site for first two days (02/02/2021, 02/03/2021). Nausea, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat, low-grade fever (~99°F) and persistent headache, and took Theraflu nighttime before bed on day two (02/03/2021). Temperature of 99.7°F throughout day three (02/04/2021); also, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat with swollen lymph nodes and tonsils with white spots (did at-home test for strep-A, got a negative result), and persistent headache?this night I also took Theraflu nighttime. Day 4 (02/05/2021), I woke up around 7AM  with severe nausea and went back to sleep after having ginger ale; throughout the early afternoon I had mild lower back and knee pain, same throat and tonsil situation, mild headache, and diarrhea. I ended up drinking a lot of water and had a glass of emergen-c as well as taking two pepto bismol tablets. Less than an hour later, I threw up everything I?d consumed throughout the day (water, hot tea, and emergen-c, no food due to nausea). Tried eating plain white rice and drinking  beer that evening but I couldn?t keep it down. Day 5 (today, 02/06/2022), I woke up with only lower back pain, same tonsil/throat situation, headache, and a slightly higher fever- 100.2°F. So far no nausea.

After 2nd shot on 02/06/21, I had most symptoms listed. I got the 2nd dose at 9:03am and once I woke up from a nap at 1pm, most of the side effects had already started. I had severe pain at the injection site where I was unable to dress myself or do normal activities, severe muscle pain and soreness, severe chills, a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a mild headache, severe dehydration that remained throughout the day and night even though I drank almost 2 gallons of water, stomach pain and bloating, and nausea and vomiting that occurred in the middle of the night at 2am, and extreme fatigue. Even though I had fatigue, I was unable to sleep due to the pain. I finally took pain medicine at 8am on 2/07/21 to help myself go to sleep as well since I was awake for over 24 hours. I slept for 6 hours and woke up still having chills, muscle soreness, a slight fever, a mild headache, and pain at the injection site where I am still unable to lift my left arm and put clothes on.

The majority of these symptoms started around 12 hours after the vaccination, with fever, chills, headache and dizziness being the most prominent. Ibuprofen (200mg) was taken about 18 hours in (as was advised to only take within the first 24 hours). Most of the symptoms are gone now after 24 hours of vaccination and taking ibuprofen. While most other symptoms are gone, there is still continued fatigue, and slight headache and nausea.

Finally cooled down at 3:00 PM and checked temperature was normal again (97.8 °F). Arm was normal temperature at 3 PM as well, stiffness did not go away until 1/31/21.

                                                The day following the shot I had a lot of arm pain, a large knot, redness, and heat at the injection site. Within 24 hours of those symptoms they subsided with Tylenol/Ibuprofen. On day 8 following the shot, I began to have an itchy sensation at the injection site. Within hours the injection site began to swell to a raised lime size knot on my skin, which continued to itch, was red, warm, and the raised skin had a few bumps on it. Again I used Ibuprofen/Tylenol and the swelling, redness, and itchiness decreased within 24 hours.

Rash was red and circular with a lighter color in the center and about an inch in width and height. Rash was not painful, firm, warm, or itchy. Rash grew vertically throughout the day to about 3 inches in hight. Patient took an oral antihistamine (alegra) at 7pm. The following morning at 8am rash reverted toward original shape and size. Rash was 99% gone by 11am that second day.

For unknown reason the patient arrived to vaccine clinic on 2/9/21 without allergy skin testing or follow up. She reportedly told them that she was &#34;&#34;cleared by Occ health&#34;&#34; after her first reaction and the administering RN said that there was no flag on her chart so she was given the vaccine.  Unfortunately, immediately after she got it, she developed throat tightening and got zyrtec. The reaction progressed very quickly (minutes) to diaphoresis, panic, grabbing at throat saying she was suffocating, nausea, and difficulty verbalizing. She was diffusely red but no hives. They couldn&#39;t get a BP and O2 sat and temp were normal but they put her on a non-rebreather and gave her Epi. Rapid response was called and she was taken to the ED.

                                                Friday morning I woke up extremely fatigued. I saw stars in my vision and I had to lay in bed all day. I didn?t have energy to even eat. Saturday evening or Sunday morning I noticed red splotches along my torso. Sunday they began to itch and I still have them along my neck, back, upper and lower torso, and a few on my legs. I haven?t changed any environmental factors (no new lotions, creams, hair products, diet, or perfumes). Today I used Benadryl cream, but in the past I?ve been putting my regular, non-scented Aveno lotion and coconut oil.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I was in the shower at 5:45pm when my left arm began to itch.  I scratched my arm a few times.  Then, I looked at my arm and noticed that it was red.  There was a red area in the exact place where I received my Covid vaccination 8 days earlier.  There were also red scratch marks from where I itched the site.  A few minutes later, the itching had subsided, but the red mark was still visible.  I got out of the shower and took pictures of this mark.  The mark was on my left arm, where I received my Covid vaccination, and was in the shape of a defined square/oval.  At the time of this report, it has been approximately 3 hours since I first noticed this reaction.  At this time, the red mark is still visible, but the it does not itch.  The red mark on my arm looks similar to images of &#34;Covid Arm&#34; I have seen reported online.  Additionally, a few days (1-3 days) before this reaction, I had the feeling of discomfort in my left armpit.  From my personal experience, this feeling was consistent with the feeling of a swollen lymph node under my armpit area.  I felt this feeling for approximately 1 day total.  I thought nothing of the discomfort at the time.  The uncomfortable feeling in my armpit subsided approximately 1-2 days before the skin reaction on my arm occurred.  I do not know if these events are related, but they occurred in the same arm (left arm) where I received my Covid vaccination.

Over the next few days, I became incredibly itchy and developed a rash on both of my arms. I now have what I think is considered, &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. There is a red circle around the injection site that is swollen, red, and tender. I then noticed the inside of my mouth was sore and I had blisters developing on the roof of my mouth near my gums. My throat is super sore and swollen and has a yellow pocket on the back of my throat. I am also having body aches under my arms near my ribs and back.

I began scratching and when I realized it was my shot I immediately stopped. I then researched to see if this was a symptom and from what I saw it was. I didn?t feel comfortable taking any medication so I just put ice on the  shot spot. The strength of the itch would vary and at times the spot would get very hot. Towards the end of the night, my whole body began to get hot so I took a shower. The shower extremely helped. I was also able to sleep without the need to itch. It?s now the next morning and the itch is slightly there, but not completely

                                                About 2 weeks after getting the first vaccine shot, the skin on my index finger of my right hand was extremely itchy. I scratched it and thought it was a bite or something. The itchy rash is all over my right hand, one spot on my left hand, and on both of my feet. While I was looking up what the rash could be, nothing really resembled the rash. Then today I saw articles about ?COVID toe?. This COVID toe rash matches my rash exactly by look and feel. I was worried I had COVID so I got a rapid test today. The results came up negative but I did have the antibodies. I believe I got this ?COVID toe? rash from the vaccine. The rash red raised patches with some purple and it is very itchy and has a burning sensation.

                                                Rash around injection site, was originally bumpy but subsided to smooth after the use of hydrocortisone cream. Rash developed on the injection site 7 days after 1st dose of Moderna. I had gone swimming the day the redness began which may have triggered the response. Additional small rashes arose on my forearm but quickly subsided with cortisone cream. However, rash on the injection site persists despite the use of hydrocortisone cream.  Redness and warmth persist. Doctor has prescribed antibiotics in case of skin infection and zyrtec.

Arm was very sore, hot to the touch, and swollen for nearly 3 weeks following the injection.  Second shot on 3/5 R arm, also developed a small red rash but was smaller and went away within a week. Within 24 hours of getting the vaccine, a high fever developed, fatigue, weakness, nausea, pain throughout my body, and migraines.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

                                                Received her Moderna vaccine on March 12 at approximately 5pm.  Within moments her arm and face began to itch.  The nurse administered Benadryl.  The symptoms did not go away or worsen so she left when released.  Around 7 the symptoms had progressed to tongue feeling heavy, sore throat, and some difficulty breathing (although her O2 fluctuated between 96-99).  She went to the ER, they administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroids.  Within a couple hours the symptoms had subsided.  As directed, we continued Benadryl and Pepcid for 24 hours.  After being off the Benadryl and Pepcid for 12 -15 hours the symptoms returned, she took one dose of both and now seems to be fine.

                                                A week after my first shot, I developed a rash. It was on my injection site, both of my upper arms, and my butt. The rash is kind of red and blotchy, and very itch. It also first looked like hives. It started to go away after a couple of days, but then came back on my arms and chest. It has been about two weeks now and the rash has not gone away.

When I looked at my arm there was a large, red splotch over the vaccination site. The red splotch was warm to touch. It continues to be itchy periodically. It has been about 11 hours since I first notice the red area and it does not seem to have improved at all.

                                                I received a BCG shot about 2 decades ago. I have a small scar on my arm from this shot. After the covid vaccine, the scar on that arm got red/swollen. It is the second day and it is still red. I have no redness where the covid vaccine was administered, just redness where the scar from my bcg shot is. Is this sone kind of reaction?

                                                On Saturday morning, I woke up with a red rash on the left side of my face. Throughout the day, the rash turned into itchy, blisters. I followed up with my primary care physician who diagnosed me with Shingles. Stating it could have been a correlation to the vaccine that compromised my immune system. I am on methyllpredinsone  and valacyclovir HCL.

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                On the morning of 1/8/2021 (exactly 6 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine), I woke up with large hives concentrated mostly on my upper body (face, neck, chest, stomach). I tried taking various antihistamines (excluding Benadryl, which would later prove effective) to combat the hives, but they were largely ineffective. The hives shifted throughout the day, starting in my upper body and working their way down to my lower extremities. The next day, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I woke up with worse hives (now all over my body, mostly concentrated on my stomach, hips, and legs) and angioedema in my face. At this point, I went to the hospital and received a course of IV fluids/steroids/Benadryl/anti-nausea medication and all symptoms subsisted. Symptoms returned a few hours after discharge, where I continued an oral regimen of the aforementioned medications. The next day, 8 days after the initial dose, my symptoms were equally severe and coupled with gastrointestinal distress, feverishness (likely due to dehydration from the Benadryl) and nausea. This morning (1/11/2021), 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my hives have largely subsisted. In summation, starting 6 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced 3 full days and nights of severe hives and swelling.

The event occurred apparently few hours after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 026L2DA) administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

My skin felt hot but minimally itchy. The insides of my hands and burn when I wash them and they feel really sore. The bottoms of my feet also felt like they were burning when I took a shower. Nothing in my diet or hygiene products have changes. I took a half dose of Benadryl at 11am today and the hives are still there along with the pain in my hands when washing them. I coordinated with my PCP and they recommended self monitoring and Benadryl.

Two days after injection, arm pain remained the same as the day before and some tiredness experienced.  Skin red and raised in a 2in radius around injection site. Third day after injection, arm pain reduced, redness gone away.  No pain by the fifth day.  7 days after injection, skin is still raised around injection site, redness returned and is now itchy, and increased tiredness.

Hurt to raise above my shoulder. This went on till about 1/9/21. Then it went away nothing at my infection site then it came back which is what my concern is same as 1/7/21 itchy, swollen, red and bruised. Why I?m reporting is I?m wondering if I should take my 2nd dose or not from these reactions just at the injection site and only fatigue. This is Day 10. I also took pictures 1/8/21 and 1/15/21

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

                                                On day 7 after receiving the vaccine, I noticed a small itchy lump in the muscle about 2 inches below the injection site.  I tried to rub the lump out slightly.  Throughout the day and the next, the skin became red and itchy and spread to a circle that is about 3in by 3 in.  Last night, I took ibuprofen and Benadryl.  The redness decreased slightly in the morning but has come back over the past few hours.  It is still itchy.  There is no longer a lump.

Ache-type pain radiates down the arm and across the upper back. For the last 2 days, it hurts whether or not I?m moving it. The vaccine was given far too high in the arm.

                                                Exactly 7 days post vaccine, the injection site started to swell and turn very red and hot to the touch. Over the course of a few days it was getting worse, starting to mimic cellulitis. I went to the ER on the 8th day, was treated with a course Cephalexin. On the 10th day it continued to spread, I went back to the ER and was taken off antibiotics. It is now day 12 and the swelling has subsided, it is no longer hot to the touch. Some redness remains as well as itchiness. Topical creams (hydrocortisone) seem to relieve itch.

                                                Pt c/o itching and tingling at site of injection.  Upon inspection RN observed redness, swelling, and irritation where pt had been scratching the site.  Offered to give pt benadryl on site, but pt refused because it &#34;knocks her out&#34; for 13 hours.  Advised to take a non-drowsy antihistamine when able, use cold compress, and stop scratching the site.  Pt was asked if she was having any other issues at that time, which she denied.  Telephone call made to patient at 4:18pm to follow up.  Pt stated she started to have an itchy throat and throat swelling and went to the hospital.  There she was offered Benadryl but declined.  She was given a steroid injection because she was having &#34;difficulty breathing&#34;.  Pt states ER doctor recommended a non-drowsy OTC antihistamine, and was unable to tell her if the difficulty breathing was an allergic reaction or due to anxiety.  Recommended following up with 2nd dose in 4 weeks but to see her PCP before that time to discuss.  Pt does not have PCP, so I recommended that she establish care and have an appt prior to her 2nd dose

                                                My lefr bicep from shoulder to elbow became extremely itchy, red, hot to touch, and slightly painful. After going to urgent care, I used a topical medication for the itch and Benadryl for the first dew days and then switching over to allergy medicine. Over a week the symptoms subsided.

These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

                                                A few hours after the first dose (1/15), a welt grew around the injection site about the size of a silver dollar.  This went away after three days. Arm was sore for the first two days.  One week later (1/22), injection site became itchy, red and was very warm to the touch.  A welt formed as well. It started out the size of a silver dollar, and over the course of  48 hours the welt, itchiness, and redness grew to  the size of a large russet potato (Friday 1/22- Saturday1/23).  It was the most red around the injection site, with the most red being about the size of a silver dollar.  After 48 hours, it remained itchy, red, and had a welt  for the next 24 hours  (Sunday 1/24). The next morning (Monday 1/25) redness and swelling were gone but site was still a little itchy.  Site was only slightly tender throughout these three days but not painful. No other side effects were noticed i.e. fever, chills, chest pain.  Slight dizziness was felt if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything.

                                                On day 1 I woke up in the morning with all the typical symptoms of the vaccine. However, I noticed a burn like rash developed on only the arm where I received the vaccine. It would flare up from time to time and lasted about a week. Before reaching out to the clinic and providers, I was taking Benadryl nightly. I then used a steroid cream, which eventually helped resolve the issue. The rash was not like normal. It was not a red hive. It was a white cluster of hives that looked like blisters.

After this I noticed I would get stomach pain intermittently. This has not gone away yet (today&#39;s date is 1/28/20). The stomach pain has been intermittent, not related to certain foods, and hurts sometimes when I don&#39;t even eat. It has progressed into getting severely bloated every time I eat any foods. The bloating lasts ~1-2 hours after consumption. No matter how big or small the meal or snack is, or what the food is, it results in me being bloated.

Sudden confusion, burning heat and hives and burning red rash spreading from injection site, up neck and throat and down arm to hand. 5 days after the injection, a severe allergic reaction occurred where my entire body broke into hives and a red burning rash, again starting at the injection site. Throat tightness, itchiness in scalp and groin, and difficulty concentrating (all my usual symptoms of anaphylaxis) occurred. Advised by health care provider to take Benadryl immediately and to have epi-pens on hand. Loratadine was prescribed.

Normally I stay up for a bit, but I felt achy and fatigued so I went to bed early. I woke up around 10am with a fever of 101.4 degrees, administered acetaminophen and went back to sleep. Woke up at 1pm and temp had dropped to 100.3, administered acetaminophen again and slept some more. My temp hovered around 100.3 until about 3pm on 01/29/21 when it dropped to 99.8. Around 6pm on 01/29/21 and about 48 hours after vaccination, my temp dropped to 98.9 and I went back to work. Along with fever I experienced headache, chills, skin sensitivity (likely due to the fever as that&#39;s a typical comorbidity for me), and body aches. I also had minor injection site side effects including redness and pain.

Woke up next morning with my fever maintained at 101 and a pounding throbbing headache. The injection site is also hard and red, with the bump increasing in size.

The bump on my arm however is growing in size and more painful.

My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 3pm 1/13/21. I was fine for the 30 minutes after, not even sore at the injection site.  Around 6pm, my muscles started aching, but not painful enough to be concerned.  At 3am 1/14/21, I woke up in pain in every muscle. Enough to wake me, but not terrible.  At 7am, I noticed a pinpoint pain in my armpit, and my muscles still ached.  At 9:30am, I took ibuprofen to attempt to curb the pain a bit.  Around 10am, it got so painful I was limping, and having trouble bending down or reaching above shoulder height.  At 11:30am, I noticed the pinpoint pain in my armpit had gotten worse, and there is a hard, approximately quarter-sized round lump in this spot. Very painful.  At 2:30, I went to move my shirt sleeve and the pain at the injection site was so intense I screamed when I touched it.  This pain continued until 1/16/21 when I woke up feeling entirely normal.  Since 1/16/2021, my hands have been randomly stiffening, either completely stretched out and dropping anything in them, or closing tight enough to leave fingernail marks on my palms. I will also reach to grab things and my hands will sometimes bend into odd shapes, instead of what I intended for them to do. This began at 1-2 times a day, and is becoming more often. It is now up to 2-4 times daily.

I went to two doctors; the first being prompt care, the second being an emergency room doctor. My rash has been present for fives day today (Feb 6th), with no sign of healing. This rash is bliserous. It is on my face, arms, hands, wrists and a few splotches here and there on my torso and hips. I am currently taking steroids, they are not helping. This rash is absolutely miserable and unlike anything I have ever experienced .

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                The first vaccine I only had mild arm pain which went away after a few days, exactly 7 days later I had a delayed localized reaction (extreme swelling size of a golf ball, redness, itching, hot to the touch). I spoke with my primary and he recommended to still get the second vaccine. The second vaccine the swelling came on almost immediately (about 2 hours after). It has now been two days since I have had the shot and my arm is now double the size of my muscle. (I am petite, 5?3 and 107 lbs) so my arms are tiny. My arm is red, hot to the touch, swollen and itchy. I have had a fever of 102.8, the lowest I have gotten it down is 101.2 with around the clock Tylenol. Other side effects: vomiting, chills, high fever, EXTREME joint pain. I?m concerned about the localized reaction (I would call it localized allergic reaction). I have photos I?m not sure if I can send them.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. I am currently experiencing redness the size of a silver dollar on and around the area of where my injection was. Also I am experiencing heat coming off the red area and itchiness. Also there are times where my forearm feels as though the blood flow is being constrained. This has been happening already for over 8 days and am concerned because it is not going away.

It is mildly pruritic but otherwise not bothersome

After 2 weeks, it progressed to my neck, but was manageable with over the counter lotion. After the second shot a month later, the itching progressed to my chest and arms. It?s become painfully itchy and I believe it to be eczema. However, I have never had this skin condition in the past. I have kept the skin clean and tried many treatments short of going to a doctor. Rubbing alcohol, witch hazel, eucerin cream, hydrocortisone cream, Benadryl anti itch cream, Benadryl, washing my bedding, and cutting my hair away from the affected areas provided no relief.  It?s been 2 months since the first symptoms and nothing has changed. In fact, it?s progressively gotten worse.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

On 03/07/21, exactly 10 days post my vaccine I developed hives/welts on both hands, both elbows , both knees, and toes  that were elevated. I also developed some minor swelling but no fever, no pain just los of itchiness. I was given a vaccine of Medrol to calm down the sxs and seem to be doing okay.

                                                Severe swelling of the area around the vaccine site noticeable 3/12/21 around 1 pm. Swelling persisted throughout the rest of the day. Cold ice pack was held to the shoulder ~8 pm for about 15-20 minutes to try to reduce the swelling, with no observable effect. Swelling had stopped by 3/13/2021 upon waking up. Redness around the vaccine site in approximately an oval with max diameter of ~ 3 inches was noticed on the night of 3/12/2021 and was similarly red throughout the entirety of 3/13/2021. The site of the vaccine was slightly itchy and tender. By 3/14/2021 the redness was mostly gone, with the diameter reduced to ~1 inch and looking more brown than red (like an old bruise).

This progressively got worse during the day, including a hard lump and was itchy. Approx. 6 hours later, I became fatigued and had body aches all over. At 30 hours post second vaccine, I started to run a temperature. It got up to 101.5 F, I took Tylenol and went to sleep. By the morning, it was gone. The next 2 days, I had a headache and very sore arm. On day 3 I developed a very sore armpit/under arm area on the same arm as I received the vaccine. As I&#39;m writing this (4 days later), my arm is still sore &amp; itchy and my underarm area is still sore, but no fatigue or fever.

No loss of breathing or swallowing. Pt took 25mg of Benadryl which stopped the swelling within the hour.  By 20 minutes, left side of face from top of head to collarbone became numb which persisted over the next 72 hours, with numbness/discomfort lasting through the week after the injection (today is 1 week). Twitching of fingers, arms, and legs also began around minute 20 and subsided about an hour after injection. No weakness of muscles or droopiness. Pt also experienced severe pain at injection site over the following 48 hours, immobilizing the left arm.

The raised knot was tender to touch. I visited the clinic to alert the nurse of my reaction. I was told to take benadryl. I took one benadryl  per day on both Tuesday, March 16 - Wednesday, March 17.  By Thursday, March 18, 2021, I did not experience anymore itching and the raised knot was no longer present. I am no longer taking benadryl.

                                                When I got home from work, I fell asleep, and when I woke up, I was itchy all over. I took a benadryl, and then I went to sleep. When I woke up the next morning, I still felt itchy all over. I worked from home all day today, and after seeing that no one had experienced itching all over online, I decided to schedule an appointment with my doctor for later in the afternoon (after work). Until then, I tried to use some anti-itch cream to help relieve some of the itchiness and overall discomfort. It did not help at all. By the time I went to the doctor, my arms were splotchy and my legs were a little splotchy. I had not really noticed it because I was working in very low lighting all day, but when I went in the doctor&#39;s office, the nurse asked about it. It was definitely NOT normal, and the doctor checked both of my arms, my back, my tummy, and my legs. I had some slight splotching on my legs, but my back and tummy were okay. Both of my arms had the worst of it. The doctor then gave me a steroid shot and a prescription to help with the allergic reaction.

Denies shortness of breath and swelling of her lips, tongue and face. She reports that she had a previous anaphylactic reaction to a meningitis vaccine. She does not have an epi pen. She started to feel like her throat was getting hoarse, so she used her albuterol inhaler. It seemed to help after a few minutes. She was also given benadryl 25mg capsule and famotidine 20mg tablet to help with itching. Physical exam was WNL, no swelling of lips, tongue or face noted. No urticaria. Lungs CTA bilaterally. Heart RRR. She was monitored until a little after 10:00am and reported that she felt like her symptoms were not worsening. Denied shortness of breath. She was heading to the school to study, so she was advised to study in a public area and to let doctor or someone else at the school know what happened so someone could check on her.

                                                Mild muscle soreness in right arm (injection site) beginning within an hour post-injection, noticeable with movement. Took 400mg of ibuprofen before bed.  At 10.5 hours post-injection (middle of night), right arm soreness was moderate-to-severe at rest and severe, almost unbearable, with movement. Mild muscle soreness and joint pain were present throughout the body; joint pain (wrist, elbows, and knees) was an issue prior to injection and was exacerbated during the event.  I also experienced chills and sharp headache pains. Took 400mg of ibuprofen, 1000mg of acetaminophen, and secured right arm with a pillow, which allowed me to fall back asleep.   At 17.5 hours (following morning), muscle soreness was present in right arm alone and was mild at rest, moderate with movement. All other symptoms were gone. Experienced fatigue that afternoon (approx. 24 hours post-injection), treated effectively with a short nap and vitamin D (through sun exposure).  On the 2nd full day post-injection, right arm muscle soreness is minimal with movement.

Redness, swelling, itching and slight pain at the area of vaccination on my left arm.  I had all of these when I got the vaccine, they started to die down and then came back around a week after the vaccine was administered. I had no other adverse reactions or signs of allergic reaction to the vaccine.

When she came out of bathroom she fainted, paramedics were summoned. Mother took patient to Emergency Room(ER) 20 April 2021, after taking her first to urgent care (who directed mother to take patient to the ER), ER sent her home saying it was just a little stomach bug, but no one else in the family got this &#34;bug&#34;.  Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

                                                I felt fine the rest of the day after I received the vaccine.  However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

After one dose of 650 mg acetaminophen my temperature went back down to 98.6 F. The next day 1/7/21 I did not have a fever; I still had mild chills and headache and pain at the site of injection. For the pain I took 1,000 mg of acetaminophen at morning and at night which eased the pain. The following day 1/8/20 I did not have headache or chills and had very mild pain which was tolerable.

                                                Initially, there was soreness, swelling, and redness (all around upper arm - a bit below deltoid) around injection site over the course of a few days. The area was warm to the touch compared to the rest of the arm. All symptoms went away after 5 days. Exactly 7 days later, a little bit of the soreness came back and there was a redness marking the size of a 50 cent coin. The next day, the soreness grew and the redness spread and the area became warm to the touch again. I talked to a doctor over video chat to talk about what I should do - I was advised to use an ice compress, which I did a few times on and off. The next day (today), redness spread, but soreness and feeling warm to the touch stayed the same. I went to urgent care and was given 7-day antibiotics and told to use Claritin/Zyrtec to lower my histamines. If anything progresses, I should let the provider know.

On Tuesday 1/5/2021 developed hives on feet and ankles. Dizziness worsened and hives had spread to hands and wrists the following day. Upon arriving to work on Thursday 1/7/2021, hives had progressively gotten worse and I was tachycardic. Called employee health where I was instructedto go to the ED. Was tachycardic 100-130 bpm and hypertensive 156/112mmHg upon arrival to the ED. Received IV Benadryl and Decadron for the reaction/hives. Viotals were normal upon discharge. Continued with Prednisone and benadryl. Taking Meclizine to help with dizziness.

I developed a low fever of 101.1F and had chills. By the  next morning your symptoms were relieved.  I did get diagnosed last Tuesday with Covid which was one week after the Moderna vaccine. A few days after I got diagnosed with Covid, the swelling returned at the injection site.   As of today I have no redness or swelling anymore at the injection site.

                                                After receiving the vaccine 1/9 in my left arm, I had normal side effects of chills, body aches, and fatigue. On 1/14, I noticed the left supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged, no pain with palpitation. On 1/15 the underside of my left arm was itchy but no visible rash. On 1/16 the arm was still itchy and the lymph node was more enlarged. No neck or axillary nodes were enlarged. On 1/17 in the morning I woke up with a large red rash on my left deltoid. It was not itchy, but as the day went on was more red, raised, and warm. The node in my neck was causing some neck discomfort. I presented to Urgent Care and was treated for a local reaction. I was given a steroid cream to use on my arm and was told to take an OTC antihistamine. I have been using the cream for 2 days and so far the rash is resolving but is still visible. The node has not yet decreased in size.

                                                Began noticing itchiness of the hands arms and shoulder on the morning of 1/16. Itchiness has continued on since 1/16 intermittently. On 1/19 it was noticed that injection site was red,  slightly raised and warm. On 1/19 I also noticed that the armpit of the vaccinated arm felt very sore and tender to touch. On 1/20 that soreness has spread down to elbow and redness has remained at injection site.

                                                Starting 01/16/2021, there was itchiness and a cluster of red papules/wheals that showed up on my right back. The rash continued to spread the next few days with increasing papules and itchiness. The rash is localized to my torso. Most are on my right abdomen and right back but is now spreading to my left side and upper back. There are also a few under and on my right breast and below both my armpit areas. The rash is still erythematous, with some that are papular and some appearing like vesicles. There is still itchiness and some stinging sensation. I am currently on Hydroxyzine 25MG at night and Zyrtec OTC during day but it has only been 2 days since I started the meds. The itch does wake me up at night time. So far the antihistamines have helped a bit with the itch. At the same time, I appear to have a sore throat though it feels more like a mild swelling of my throat as whenever I swallow it feels sore.

Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

                                                I started to notice on Tuesday, January 19th, that there was a red bump on my arm. It looked more like a mosquito bite to me and was not bigger than a quarter. It didn?t feel itchy but I thought nothing of it. I noticed when I got home it was twice as big but I still felt no pain. It appeared that my arm was also swollen. The following day on Wednesday, it has grown in size again covering my arm, maybe the size of four quarters. Throughout the day it felt a bit hot, especially when I touched it. It did not feel itchy and I didn?t feel any pain. I felt a bit tired this day so I?m not sure if it was because of it. The redness has gone down today (Friday, January 22nd) however the mark is still big and in the shape of a square now. The outer part of the mark is more red and raised up, like it has a red border.

It is slightly swollen and mildly tender but not itchy or painful otherwise. I should note that I had a rather significant amount of swelling and pain for the first few days after the injection, but it subsided after 4-5 days.

After a week of receiving vaccine: got noticeably more itchy, and swollen.  Redness (seemed to be like a rash with no hives) started to grow in size everyday. Used Benadryl which didn?t seem to stop it.   Now it?s been two weeks since I?ve received the shot and rash is still here, currently using cortizone-10 to help with itchiness

                                                I first got symptoms on Jan 19th with extreme muscle soreness from my shoulders to my toes with hives on my thighs and what felt like a bug bite on my knuckle and a circular bite on my left forearm.  The muscle soreness was there for 3 days.  It was very hard to walk for a while cause of just the soreness.  I still feel a little in my ankles and toes still but fully recovered.

It had a knot on it and a red ring about 3 inches around the injection site. I placed a cold pack on my arm for 15-20 minutes. The area was still hot to touch for another 12-24 hours. The hotness has subsided and most of the itching, but my arm still feels sore and has about a 2.5 inch red area around it. Note that my swelling, redness and itching had completely subsided before this particular shower. I did not use any different products in my shower than I had used the days previously following my injection.

It was somewhat itchy for 2 days, and continue to grew in size for 4 days. The rash was improved by taking over the counter allergy medicine (Allegra 24 hour). It was slightly raised and swollen the first 2 days, but decreased over the following days although the rash itself got larger.  I did not seek medical attention because I did not have any other symptoms or side effects with the rash, and was able to self-treat with allergy meds.

                                                Despite not having any abnormal reactions immediately following the vaccine (except for pain at site of injection, muscle aches, chills - which went away after 3 days), a week after the vaccine, I noticed that my left arm was hard around the injection, and a bit itchy. I massaged it a bit, and it started hurting - that night, I woke up from the pain, and had to take ibuprofen to sleep (probably 4/10). The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better. This went on all of Friday as well - I took some Benadryl, and that seemed to make it better (or it might have just made me sleepy enough that I didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not sure). I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness. Sunday, the redness in both areas continued to fade, but the bumps were noticeable and more itchy than before. The hardness seems to have resolved almost completely, although the area is still a bit sore when massaged.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

I put cold compresses on it that afternoon and took a Benadryl for a couple of days and it resolved on its own.

                                                7 days after receiving the vaccine, I developed a large, warm red blotch about 3-4in in diameter on my left deltoid. The following day, this blotch spread more than an inch down my arm and developed a prominent red ring around the border.  For a couple days, I took Zyrtec, thinking I may have been bitten by something, which had no effect. 10 days after getting the vaccine, I had an in-person appointment with my PCP who examined my arm and reported to me that this has been seen in patients who received the Moderna vaccine, usually appearing 5-7 days following vaccine administration. Today (11 days after the vaccine), the blotch continues to spread but appears less red and is clearing in the center where it originated. No fever, minimal swelling, hot/warm to the touch at times, no itching, border is slightly raised at times. I was told to monitor and call if I see red streaks traveling from the area indicating infections.

                                                Woke up around 5AM with a severe headache and tenderness at injection site. Throat was also very dry. Was not able to go back to sleep due to pain. Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

Had shoulder soreness day 2 post vaccine and was taking Motrin and Tylenol with some relief. Pain continued to get better. On day 9 post vaccine, pain returned with intensity and was seen at urgent care on 1/9. Shoulder was swollen and red at the time, so urgent care NP diagnosed cellulitis and I was prescribed Keflex, along with instruction to continue taking Motrin, Tylenol. Called out of work on 1/11 d/t shoulder pain/decreased range of motion. Today (1/13) pain is much better but still having some pain/discomfort in the shoulder.

                                                I received the vaccine around 2:30/3 PM. The same night I began feeling as if my throat was itchy around 11 PM. I took a Zyrtec because I thought my friends dog was giving me a little allergies. 20 minutes later my throat itch got progressively worse to where I started to feel a little wheezy and harder to breathe. My arm where the vaccine was felt itchy. I had a rash all on my left arm and upper chest where I had received the vaccine. Immediately, I took a benadryl then went to sleep. Around 3 AM I woke up uncontrollably shivering. My fiance was able to get me a heater because I was so chilled with shivers but was sweating profusely. These shivers lasted about an hour to where I finally just went to sleep. I woke up around 7 AM with a pounding headache so I finally decided to take my temperature. It was 102 F. I ran a fever all day and brought it down to 100 with ibuprofen.  I ran a slight fever the next day as well with extreme fatigue.

I had severe chills, severe body aches, a mild fever, and extreme redness and swelling at the injection site. The side effects kept me out of work for one shift. The chills, body aches, and fever subsided within 36 hours, the severe redness and swelling at the injection site has continued to persist. I took Tylenol 1g q8hr for the side effects.

Itchy, red, hot to the touch. Tried benadryl- this did not work well enough so employee health NP prescribed Atarax. I took this for 3 days and the rash started to go down.

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

                                                I received the first part of the Moderna vaccine 1/9/21 in my left arm. On Thursday 1/14 I noticed an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node on the left side. On Friday 1/15 I had some itching on my arm but no visible rash. On Sunday 1/17 there was a large visible rash localized to my left deltoid. The lymph node was causing some neck discomfort as well. I presented to the Urgent Care as was given steroid cream to apply and I have also been instructed to take an OTC antihistamine.

Later that same day at 8 pm in the evening  my right arm where i received the injection started hurting. I had a small bump around the injection site It was also tender to the touch. I Iced my arm I also applied hot compress to the injection site. I also had some chills as well. I took acetaminophen to relieve the discomfort. Today is 1/2/2021 and i am feeling a lot better. My arm has stopped bothering me. I don&#39;t have a bump around the injection site and it isn&#39;t tender to the touch. I have also stopped taking the acetaminophen and i don&#39;t have any chills. I only had this reaction for one day.

The nurses administering the COVID vaccines suggested that I call the on-call allergist. He said not to worry. He recommended that I take an allergy pill each day until the rash/bump went away. He also said to ice the rash/bump and massage the area. 8 days after the vaccination, the rash welted, remained red and itchy, and grew about 6 times larger than the day before. The nurses administering the COVID vaccine called the same on-call allergist that I spoke to the day before and he recommended to take the allergy pill twice a day and continue the ice and massage of the area. 9 days after the vaccination, the rash started to get better. 10 days after the vaccination, the rash was mostly gone. 11 days after the vaccination, the rash was all gone.

                                                Very itchy arm that has persisted, this far, to a month after getting the vaccine. At the injection site and around that general portion of my upper arm. Sometimes it&#39;s perfectly fine, sometimes it&#39;s red or pink and either will or will not be itchy as well. If I scratch at it too much, which I try really hard not to but it&#39;s really hard not to, and then the little rash-looking areas turns into a small area of mini skin hives. Still redish/pink and itchy. Then I try not to mess with it for the most part, but it&#39;s just consisted since then. Idk if this is a me problem, specifically cause I got some weird skin hive stuff going on actually on my eyes at night (randomly) that randomly occur. And that started way before I got the vaccine. With the hives on my arms, it will persist for a while at a time and go away before coming right back again as itchy as ever. It&#39;s been basically every single day since I got my vaccine that these side effects have been going on. #StillSupportIt lol. (:

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

                                                On 2/2 I woke up with extreme fatigue, headache, body aches, joint pain, and temperature of 100.5. This lasted for 24 hours. On 2/3 my arm felt very warm, so I looked at it in a mirror and found a large, round/hexagonal area of swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness. Today is 2/6 and it continues to spread the redness, swelling, and warmth down towards my elbow. It occasionally itches, but is usually painful and stings.

Now, (3 days after injection) swelling still present. Still hot and hard to the touch and size remains the same. Pain and redness mostly resolved. Now starting to itch.

                                                Arm pain - extreme. I couldn&#39;t fully move my arm which lasted 24 hours. And then it lessened so I could use it but still pain for three or four days. Redness on injection site - just a big, red spot (not rash). Red spot went away and then a big white spot - six days for white spots. Almost like my arm wasn&#39;t getting blood - just white like that for a few days. Headache - still have it - minor enough when I wake up but when I go to bed that every other day I&#39;m still taking medicine for it; nausea; fever; chills; hot flashes - lasted 5 or six days; fatigue - still have a little fatigue. It is better than it was. At first I was sleeping 15-16 hours a day. Still have to go to bed earlier than normal. Stomach pain - those are gone now; runny nose; loss of appetite; brain fog - I knew what I wanted to say or do but couldn&#39;t. Advil was taken and I tried Tylenol, too. I iced my arm. I did a humidifier.

Rash cleared up mostly in 2 days before steroid cream was even used. Circles were drawn around rash splotches to check if spreading. Rash did spread outside of one of the circles, but has since cleared up.

The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

I did not take any medications to treat these symptoms and they have faded away for the most part. There is significantly less redness and no longer an urge to scratch.  I have not experienced any other serious adverse reactions. I was advised to see an allergist, however, my insurance requires that I see my PCP to get a prior auth/referral for an allergy specialist. The allergist that is contracted with the Super POD has a 50&#43; person waitlist and I will be going to my local urgent care to see a provider.

                                                On 2/23/2021, 1 week after my first shot of the vaccination (on 2/16/2021), I experienced an slightly itchy arm right around the injection sight. Later in the day I noticed that same area turn red. The following day the reddened, itchy, area became slightly darker in color but less red and had a darker ring around the edge of the discolored area. The next day the discolored area looked the same. By Friday (2/26/2021) the discolored area began to go away but the ring around it was still prominent.

At this time on 2/28/2021, I still have the raised red mark on my area but it has lightened and it is still itching. My lymph nodes are still swollen and a headache is still present as well as fatigue but the sore throat has mostly resolved.

                                                pt stated that 10 minutes after receiving the covid vax her throat started closing so she went to the ER.  She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

By day 1 after the vaccine I also had hives and a rash at the injection site. A week after my second dose, I also had more hives pop up on my face and a bit at the injection site. And every few weeks, I have a few come up at the injection site and on my face, and then they go away.

I also had severely painful swollen axillary lymph nodes on the same side that I received my injection. I was not able to work or do any of my daily activities for almost three days. Then on day 7 after receiving my first vaccine dose, I developed a itchy, painful, red rash and hives surrounding the injection site (about a two to three inch radius around the injection site. I also got hives and red itchy painful skin on my face. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed prednisone and a week of pepside and zyrtec. After a week I stopped taking the allergy meds and then the hives came back, so I kept taking the allergy meds until my second vaccine dose.

As the days passed the rash spread all over my body it continued to be itchy, inflamed &amp; red but the itchiness was the worst. I seen my doctor on unspecified date and he prescribed me medication &amp; gave me a steroid shot &amp; steroid pills. This lasted for about 2 months.  I still have like a scar because of the rash on the vaccine site but it doesn&#39;t bother me.

I noticed swelling in my arm and began taking Ibuprofen.  Sometimes my arm would begin to &#34;wake up&#34; and my whole are would tingle. On 3/7/2021 I developed a red area around the injection site and my arm swelling was more pronounced.  My arm also feels hot somtimes.    I have continued to take Ibuprofen and place ice on my arm in the evening.  I continue to have the swelling, hot arm, red patch, and pain in my arm as of today.  The &#34;numb&#34; feeling is something that comes and goes.

                                                There is a rash that has appeared on my left arm surrounding the injection site. It started to feel uncomfortable on Monday, March 8th, and then today it felt a  little bit itchy. When I looked in the mirror, I saw a red rash. The area feels warm to the touch, it doesn&#39;t feel painful, but uncomfortable. It is about the diameter of my thumb, albeit not a perfect circular shape.

By Tuesday evening it had spread over most of my left arm. When I woke up Wednesday 3/10, the rash had spread to my stomach and upper thigh. By Wednesday evening, it haha spread to my chest, neck, back, and legs.

The sleep aid did not help as I only slept a few hours but could not stay asleep due to the pain. I woke up at 7 AM to feed my cat, then tried to lay back down, but was unable to. I went to the toilet feeling nauseous and wretched a few times but did not throw up. I did, however, experience diarrhea that morning and throughout the day. I laid down on the couch and fell in and out of sleep for a few hours. I felt the headache most of the morning, until about 11 AM,. I felt the chills throughout most of the day. I treated my pain with ibuprofen 200mg tablets (3 taken each time, 4-6 hours apart), Pepto-bismol for the nausea and had mostly liquids such as water and juice as well as bread and crackers. I felt much better by around 2 PM, except for the tenderness and swelling in my arm.

                                                When originally obtaining the vaccine, I had little side effect; the only thing I noticed was a slight fever for a few hours and a sore arm for a few days. 8 days after the shot was given, I developed a small swollen welt at the site of injection. I thought it may have been a mosquito bite, as I had spent the evening outside. That evening, I kept an eye on the swelling, and it was about the size of a half-dollar coin by the time I went to bed. When I woke up throughout the night (this is normal, as my sleeping patterns are irregular) I noticed more soreness in my arm. When I awoke for the day, the swelling had grown to be about the size of my hand. It is now sorer, and somewhat itchy, but I am managing with ibuprofen.

The morning after the vaccination, I also had fever, chills, headache, joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue. The fever was relieved somewhat by an ibuprofen, and went away entirely about 24 hours after the injection. Other symptoms subsided more slowly. The second day after the vaccination, I still had a mild headache and some joint and muscle discomfort, and my right arm was still painful, though somewhat improved by evening. The third day after the vaccine (Monday 3/15), I had no symptoms except occasional joint pain and a slight soreness of the vaccination site.

General malaise, low grade fever. Site reaction spread down arm, went to urgent care &amp; was told it may be cellulitis &amp; was given antibiotics &amp; told to go to ER if it continued to spread. It spread outside of line that was drawn the next day so I went to ER. They did nothing &amp; told me remain on antibiotics &amp; to see allergist &amp; PCP. Reaction continued to spread, arm/hand numbness &amp; general feeling of illness, slight fever continued for approx. 2 weeks following vaccine. Site reaction fully subsided visually by 1/26 (began 1/15). Allergist suggested it was severe immune reaction to vaccine. Felt generally unwell for approx. 5 weeks following vaccine. Was told I should not get second dose or any covid/flu vaccines in the future. I have history of poor reaction to vaccines/site reactions.

                                                March 18, 2021 I noticed my arm was itchy but only had a few small bumps. Later that same day around 9:00pm I noticed a uncolored 2 1/2 inch in diameter welt on my arm and it was very very itchy. I took Benadryl and went to bed. March 19, 2021 I woke up and the swelling went down a little but now the area is very red. Slightly itchy.

Diarrhea has persisted since hours after the vaccine, almost a month later including painful stomach cramping. These gastrointestinal symptoms were not present beforehand and appeared at the same time as the other side effect but the GI issues have not resolved or even lessened. I may need to seek medica attention if it persists.

She denied that the rash had spread but was uncomfortable and that her throat was burning and really scratchy.   Our nurse here at the health dept. advised her to call her physician now and if symptoms worsened to go to the ER. I called patient this afternoon at 4:30 pm and she said that her doctor had given her a Benadryl shot and had sent her to the ER. She was on her way when I called her so I will call back tomorrow.

                                                I felt arm pain in my left arm Around 4:00 pm, I started reaching for my face but I could not feel my face - it felt numb and tingly. That went on for two hours. There was no other droopiness juts facial numbness. My arm pain lasted for a good three weeks. It caused the lymph nodes under my armpit to swell. The pain went from my axilla Lymph nodes down to my left breast.  I got a pinkish, reddish, itchy rash at the spot on the injection about a week later. I don&#39;t recall the date for the doctor visits - one telehealth and one in person. They wanted me to use Primrose oil to massage the oil. They told me to keep an eye on it. I still continue to get the pain under my arm pit from time to time. I have still been seeing physician about that.

Then, a day later I noticed my arm was swelling about 3-5 inches from the injection site. Where it was swelling it became red, hard, and warm to the touch. My arm continued to itch in the said area and the size and symptoms persisted for about 2 weeks. I started doing cold compresses and taking Tylenol after week 2, the symptoms seemed to slowly subside over about 3-4 days. I total it took about 2 and a half weeks to rid of the side effects.

Injection site was hot to the touch and it felt like a knot was under my skin. around 10:00am I began to feel feverish all over my body. I began to have the chills and began to feel tired. My body was achy as well and a headache developed. I slept from about 12:30PM to 6:30 PM and took acetaminophen at that time. Feverish feeling and chills broke after pill got into my system. Arm is still in major pain.
