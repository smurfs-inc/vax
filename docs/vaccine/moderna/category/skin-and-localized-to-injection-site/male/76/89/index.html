                                                Rash and itch developed at the spot of the inoculation about 10 days after the shot. Treating with benadryl cream. Primary care physician was informed and said it was not serious. He advised taking Claritin if the cream didn&#39;t work. So far the itching has abated.

                                                About 8pm I began t experience total body itching.  At 11pm the itching was too much to allow for sleep.  I took two Gabapintin 300mg.  At 4AM I went to sleep.  I contactedmy dermatologist.  He suggested the vaccine may have started a Grover&#39;s response.  He asked that I add Zyrtec (over the counter) to my meds.  He asked that I continue hydrating my skin with Vanicream cream.  I folllowed his advice.  The itching stopped on Sunday.  I continued with the Zyrtec but stopped the Gabapintin.   Today, Tuesday, I am having muscle tightening, especially in my legs.

Extreme pain in area of left arm/shoulder where the vaccine was given. Arm severely ached for 48 hours in any position, was very tender/painful to touch, and difficult to use or move. I&#39;m pretty tough where pain is concerned with past injuries (broken leg in 17 pieces, severely sprained ankles, broken ribs, broken tail bone from horse accident. This vaccination arm pain was right up there with the worst.

Then, 7 days after receiving vaccine, I developed a pruritic swelling a few inches below injection site.  Next day (day 8) noted 4-5&#34; diameter area of slight swelling and erythema below injection site.  Pruritis  became mild ache. No warmth.  Note: when I received vaccine there was a little acute bleeding from injection site,  then over next few days I developed a 2&#34; diameter dark ecchymosis at site, still present on day 10, possibly lighter.  On day 10 note minimal swelling and erythema extending dow n from injection site in a rough triangle ~ 5-6&#34; high with apex just below injection site, seems to be resolving.

I reported it to public health the day after onset, but they never called back to get the appropriate information. It resolved with no after effects, but I saw an article today that it was an uncommon reaction (&#34;delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity&#34;), but thought I would report it for your data base. I&#39;d be interested if this should cause any concern regarding the second injection, like getting it in the other arm.

After showering the next day I noticed a red area about 4 inches wide and 8 inches long with slight swelling and itching.  The swelling and itching was not noticed in the days immediately following the shot.  I will contact my doctor about the situation and follow up with them if the condition gets worse or does not go away.

                                                Beginning approximately 72 hours after receiving his first dose of the Moderna, he noted redness around the injection site of the left arm. He said the area felt warm to the touch and was slightly itchy. This lasted for 3-4 days before it resolved on its own without treatment.  Today (13 days post vaccination) he noted the rash on the left arm return but it was fainter than when it first came up around 72 hours after vaccination. He states the area today is 3.5 inches by 1.5 inches in size on the left arm only.  He denies other symptoms or changes in  skin care routine.

Presented to ED with newly diagnosed AML, in MDS with WBC counts ~250, 000.    He had a normal (EX ANEMIA) CBC on Jan-21. He had COVID vaccine #1 on Jan-25.  About 4-days later he developed diffuse dermititis and severe fatigue. He had an  ED visit on Feb-8 for these issues and was prescribed Prednisone and Cefalexin  (completed Feb-15).  CBC was NOT done at that ED visit. He called HEME clininc  on Feb-16 (see also the Hematology Note) stating that he was just NOT feeling  well in general with increased fatigue and DOE. He noted that the dermatitis was  mostly resolved. We rechecked CBC on Feb-17 (results available about 4-PM) that  indicated ACUTE LEUKEMIA.  Presents to the MC with MDS on FEB18.

The itching started once the redness appeared.  My physician prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream  and Benedryl.  I have been using the cream for 2 days and the redness is fading away.  The itching has stopped.  Seems to be improving.  Scheduled to get 2nd dose on  March 2 at 11:30 AM at the same location.

                                                One week after the second shot I started to get bumps on my neck, that was on a Friday night.  By Sunday it was much worse so I went to the emergency care facility and the Dr. told me I had shingles and prescribed  Valacyclovir for 7 days.  I reached out to people on an App and explained my side effect.  There were over 9 people that also had the shingles after the second dose.  They didn&#39;t necessarily get the shot from the same pharmacy.   It is obvious that there is a direct correlation between the two.

                                                Patient&#39;s report: About one week after the immunization, I noticed a burning sensation within an ~3 inch diameter region on my back near my right shoulder blade.  The pain was a constant 1 to 2 on a 10 point scale--tolerable but concerning.  My wife inspected the affected region every night for about a week and saw no sign of inflammation or bruising.  She applied lotion once per night for several nights and that might have slightly reduced the pain.  I tried Tylenol only once and it seemed to have no effect. The pain has persisted, but seems to be reducing in strength to barely perceptible now.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

I had my doctor check it in case it was infected  or a reaction  from the vaccine.  He felt it was a reaction to the vaccine.  The site doesn&#39;t hurt and it&#39;s not warm.  The site isn&#39;t changing from when I first noticed it 2 weeks ago.

This continued about 1 1/2 hrs. then he could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom; thus wetting himself multiple times during the night; Patient was restless for about 5 hrs. but still could not get up even with me (his spouse) trying to help.  He also could not understand how to help move his body to keep from falling out of bed (never fell out but I could not get his entire body on the bed until our daughter arrived around 9:30 am.  It took our grandson who is 6&#39;5&#34; tall &amp; 275 lbs. to help get patient up and walked him into our sunroon.  throughout the day, patient could not stand without help &amp; continued to urinate on himself.  He could, however, feed himself breakfast &amp; lunch.  At 7:30 pm grandson and daughter had to walk patient into bedroom.  patient could not walk without us telling him how and pushing his feet forward.  It took both grandson and daughter to pull him onto the bed as he collapsed when he got to the bed.  Patient slept until approximately midnight. at that time our daughter helped him to the bathroom and helped to change his underwear and tshirt which was wet from having a fever.  Afterward, patient was able to go to the bathroom by himself but was very tired.  He was able to walk outside with the help of a cane on 2/5/21 2 pm.  On 2/6/21, patient complained of his back hurting and itching.  We discovered he had shingles!  Not a full body rash but shingles on his left side around his waist.

                                                I had my (Moderna) first dose yesterday.  Within ~6 hour the soreness level of the shoulder joint (but not especially the site of the jab) zoomed up to intense.  So much so, that simply lifting my arm slow-motion to the level of my eyes caused intense pain spasms.  Last night and this morning were equally severe.  Within the last hour or so, the pain level has diminished a bit.  NOTE: I know how people rate pain is super subjective.  In my case working as a geologist in a quarry a number of years ago, I was struck and pinned by a large boulder.  The ER crew would not give me a pain killer, so that they could monitor how the Jaw of Life was working (it broke, the boulder was too heavy), so I not surprisingly passed out several times from the pain level before being extricated.  Needless to say, this compound fracture of the tibia and fibula accident was a 10 of 10 pain level.  Yesterday&#39;s CV-19 jab pain level was an 8-9 of 10.  Nothing I read before yesterday&#39;s jab, Fauci et al, prepared me for this pain level.  So, is this normal???  My POV is, I think, atypical in this matter of pain. Should I be concerned about a return to normalcy right now (today / tomorrow) as well as for the second dose??  I HOPE THAT A MEDICAL PERSON WILL RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL - NOT SOME BOILER PLATE WORDS.

                                                It was itching. The outside of my upper arm was itchy and I rubbed it and scratched it a little and the itchiness seemed to be centered at the injection site. The itchiness lasted for about 3 days. I have not been itchy today which is the 4th day so it seems to have gone away. It was not irritating me all of the time, I could concentrate on other things and be oblivious to it. But sometimes when I rubbed it I could feel a little bit of swelling again at the injection site. When I looked at it there was some redness that could have been caused by my rubbing or scratching, some redness on the skin.  I tried to located swelling when it first appeared but couldn&#39;t find any and I didn&#39;t notice any that was worrying.

Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It didn&#39;t itch, it hurt when something was dragged over it, like a finger or clothing.  It was deep, deep red and some parts of his body there was no regular skin showing.  Took him to ER, where tests were run, showing his liver counts were way off.  Biopsy was taken of the rash.  It was determined that the rash was similar to Stevens-Johnson and he was admitted for 2.5 days.  They put him on large doses of steroids, which helped the rash.  All labs were headed in the right direction except his liver panel.  He was sent home and returned to doctor in 3 days to run panels again.  All were headed in right direction, even the liver.  He will see his cardiologist to be put back on his heart medicines.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

He said that he did some home remedies. Per pt, the rash lasted for 8 days. He is ok now.

                                                Neurological, including trigeminal neuralgia and one Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms.  Tried to complete online at library on 2/24/2021 but timed out at 20 minutes.  Item #18:  CDC asked to report any Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms (also trigeminal neuralgia is related to BP).  48 hrs post vax, mid-afternoon Sat, Feb 6th: Suddenly unable to comprehend book I was reading;  and  there was a physical sensation of irritation just inside my skull, wrapping around my brain (meninges?) -  it did not intrude into brain.  Felt lack of &#39;presence&#39; in room.  Slightly unstable on my feet.  Believed these were related to vaccine, would soon abate, but, also, that this would be no way to go through life!   These lasted 2-3 hours.  (I neither drink alcohol or take recreational drugs.)  About that time, a &#39;twinging&#39; precursor to trigeminal neuralgia began   uncertain whether it was TN?  Recurred every 3 hrs.  But then awakened at 6:30 a.m. by two painful TN jabs, repeated more strongly at 9:40 a,m.  At about 12:30 pm, return of light &#39;twinging&#39; sensation, then nothing  no recurrence.  3rd TN episode in 3 years, the briefest, the only one not requiring oxcarbazepine.  Checked for Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms (which I&#39;ve never had):  The left side of my mouth wasn&#39;t producing any saliva at all  none.  This improved very slowly, continuing for 5 or 6 days; by far the longest lasting symptom.  About Monday, the 8th, experienced an expanded  time warp driving to library  took forever to reach two roundabouts.  Lucid, alert, vision &amp; reactions normal.  Speed was a mile or two above limit.  No euphoria or nystagmus.  At library, conversation and work seemed normal.  Around the same time I had about an 18 hour complete memory loss with regard to medications.  Two dose periods in succession.    On Monday, Feb 8th, I called our 4 day a week neurologist.  He said the symptoms    were an immune response to the vaccine but that he&#39;s never seen them together before.  It was scary.  I&#39;m not going to take the second dose at this time.  And will depend upon PCP.       Filling out this form because you&#39;ve asked about any adverse reaction related to Bell&#39;s Palsy (which TN is closely related to).  I wonder how many others have experienced trigeminal neuralgia symptoms following vaccination?  It&#39;s a cumulative disease and devastating in advanced forms.  :-(

                                                After nearly 2.5 months I still have pain in my upper left arm near the injection site and in the right arm from the second dose. This makes it difficult to put on jackets, shirts, etc without significant pain and also interrupts my sleep. This pain is constant but aggravated by movement. I would rate it 7 on a 10 scale. I am wonder if this might be SIRVA or something similar. I have never had issues with vaccinations previously.

I had a red area about the size of an apple. Telephone conversation on 3/16/2021 with family physicians&#39; office resulted in treatment to use TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE CREAM, .1% twice a day. Cream reduced itching for approximately 4 to 5 hours after each application.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included flecainide acetate and finasteride.  On 29 Jan 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 004M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 04 Feb 2021, the patient felt kind of sleepy.  On 05 Feb 2021, his left eye was covered with blood inside and he felt itchiness at the injection site.   On 07 Feb 2021, the injection site became very red and was oval in shape and it was about two an half by four inches. On that same day, his blood pressure was high at 160/90.  He said his normal blood pressure was 20/70.  Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The event of blood pressure was high at 160/90 was not resolved at the time of this report.   The outcome of  left eye blood covered inside, kind of sleepy, itching around injection site, and  injection site reddish and oval shaped was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

No other side effects noticed and felt fine.  8 days later on Jan 28, developed a large elongated 4&#34; by 2&#34; itchy red rash at the injection site (upper left arm). As of today Jan 31, 3 days later, I still have the rash and so far not diminishing. Feel fine otherwise, no fever or pain,  just annoying and unsightly rash.

Around that same time the patient sprayed his home with pest control. Patient called his PCP and reported that they could not tell if the rash was from the bug spray or the Moderna vaccine. The patient&#39;s PCP advised him it would be fine for him to receive his second vaccine, but to take Zytec 10mg x1 the day of his second vaccine and to observed for 30 minutes after that vaccine was given. Patient did not have any problems immediately after the second moderna vaccine on 2/1/2021.

Yesterday (January 31st), I noticed for the first time  a redness on my left arm surrounding the injection site.  I had just bathed and the hot water may have made the redness more apparent.  Today when I bathed I again noticed the red patch and took a photo of it, which I will share if requested.   I am reporting this so that you can include this instance in your tracking of &#34;Covid Arm&#34;, about which there has been some reporting in USA Today and other newspapers.

However, a week ago I developed a rash on my right foot &amp; lower leg.  It got worse and so I visited with my dermatologist. He immediately diagnosed it as SHINGLES.  The only reason I can think of that brought the attack on seems to be the vaccine??  I?m scheduled for the second booster shot on Feb 11th and quite frankly, I?m worried.    Have other vaccinated folks complained about getting Shingles?  Do you have information about getting the second shot and how that affects getting Shingles?  Thanks for your assistance.

                                                About 4 hours after his vaccine, the injection site starting hurting, but not bad.  He could not sleep on it at night as he felt like he was sleeping on a red hot pocker.  On Saturday he was extremely tired in the afternoon.  Had to come in from yard work as he could not function.  He also had pain in his neck and shoulders.  On Sunday he the feelings were going away, but his muscles started aching.  On Monday he felt really strange, felt like he was in a fog, and his muscles ached.  He could not get relaxed, did his normal Monday chores, laundry and house cleaning.  He then tried to relax but his muscles and nerves were very tense.  He went to bed around 9:30 on Monday, fell asleep and awoke at 2:00 AM and could not go back to sleep his muscles in his arms and legs were in spasm and his arm would jump like a shock reaction and jump off of the mattress, as well as his leg.  It was worse on the left side than the right arm.  This went on every 10-15 minutes for about 3-4 hours.  Around 4:00 AM this morning it eased off to sleep and woke up at 10 and felt better today.  He hasn&#39;t had any more of the seizure type feelings in his arms or legs.  He did speak with Moderna who told him that he was the 4th one with this reaction and to report this to us.

I asked my wife if my face was  red and she said, ?yes?. I felt somewhat weak and paramedic called the Dr over.  We talked and he determined that I had not eaten.  Walked me around car, put me in the passenger seat.  My wife  then drove.  I was a little disoriented late but didn?t complain. Since then I have felt like I did in July 2019 when I had coronial virus.  Felt bad, 93oxygen, 77 heart beat which is high for me.   Friday I did not get out of bed nor went outside. Sat more of the SamE.  Woke up at midnight sat and felt better.  I?m better but weak.

He complained of headaches and it was hurting all over. He was very weak and had chills. He had labored breathing. His nephrostomy was bleeding a lot in the tubes so they had to hospitalize him. He went to hospital on 27-Apr-2021 and was currently in the hospital. He had blood transfusions and he was very dehydrated. He was put on IV saline. He took Eliquis but doctors wanted to stop it because his kidneys were not in good shape.  Company comment: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He did not complain of discomfort.  He did not not complain of being tired.   We do not know when it first appeared.  It was not there the first few days, then we quit checking.  As of now, 5pm, it seems less red than earlier today.

                                                I had Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on Wednesday February 3 at 11:30 AM . After the vaccine I went home and had virtually no pain. Around 10PM that night I felt some pain in the toes on my left foot. When I looked, I noticed that my toes were red and appeared slightly swollen.   My big toe was the worst. It was sensitive to the touch and very red. I also felt a short intermittent sharp pain that would last a second or two. It would happen every 3-4 minutes. The next day the redness was gone on all but my big toe.  As I write this today Saturday February 6 at at 11 AM. My big toe is still sore, but does appear a bit better.   I have had gout once in the past. So, gout or Covid ?   The people at were great.

Today, 02/08 2021, the itching and redness have substantially declined to the point that I have discontinued the hydrocortisone treatment.

They did a biopsy on the area on right leg and I feel like ants are crawling all over me and biting. on my back there&#39;s no redness but it feels like ants biting and itching. the doctor&#39;s stated there&#39;s no bacterial or fungal infection. This attack is from the knee down both arms and back only and the doctor had no other treatment for it other than cortisone cream and nothing seems to stop it.

Moderna Dose #2:   About 7 hours post-injection I experienced a temperature (101 F peak) and mild chills, a short-term mild headache, mild muscle /joint aches, and an ache at the injection site.  These effects lasted for about 36 hours and then were gone.  I would compare them to a mild 2-day case of the flu.

This spontaneous case was reported by a physician assistant (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of RASH (rash from the elbows to the wrists in both arms) in a 79-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 004M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history reported. ). Concomitant products included SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) for an unknown indication.    On 01-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 11-Feb-2021, the patient experienced RASH (rash from the elbows to the wrists in both arms) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PERIPHERAL SWELLING (Moderna arm) and RASH MACULAR (a very red splotch that was 4x3inches for the first 3 days but know it has been spreading reaching). At the time of the report, RASH (rash from the elbows to the wrists in both arms), PERIPHERAL SWELLING (Moderna arm) and RASH MACULAR (a very red splotch that was 4x3inches for the first 3 days but know it has been spreading reaching) outcome was unknown.

Over the next few days the pain got worse so that I couldn&#39;t lie on that side of my body. The symptoms progressed towards my shoulder and neck and other lymph nodes became painful. The next phase a few days later was red spots and blisters around the injection site on my chest near my neck on my left side. At the present time the blisters have mostly gone away but they&#39;ve been replaced by welts where the red spots were these are swollen and red. All of these symptoms are accompanied by fatigue and muscle pain also around my left shoulder. I have been treating it for the past 3 days with ice and am now taking an antihistamine Benadryl.

Also, pain at injection site, across shoulder and lower neck for approx 24 hours after shot.

Was given Tylenol and temp went up to 104.  She called the doctor at 2:00 PM, told her to see the doctor.  Lethargy and weakness.  Tested him for COVID and flu and still had fever.  Was negative for both, told to alternate Tylenol and Ibuprofen, went down to 102.  At 6:30 PM went up to 103.8, at that point she called the doctor, could not speak to him until 6:45 PM instructed to bath down with warm rag, and was told it was probably a reaction to the vaccine.  Was called in a steroid pack.  He went to bed running about 103.6 at 8:30 PM.  Was able to get up, was given more Tylenol/Ibuprofen and his fever finally broke around 101 about 4:00 AM.  Got up this morning and does feel better.  Running around 100-101 temp.  The vaccine is the only thing that has been different in his normal routine.  Still has warmth to the injection site, red.

He pressed on it and it burst open and water came out of it.

He did not take anything for it.

Pt had area of erythema, 11.5cm X 7.5cm, oval shaped on his right arm, At the top of the oval, there was a more hard and reddened area, 4cm circular, and the area around it was more diffuse, lightening to the edge. Pt denies &#34;any real itching&#34; but did c/o tenderness when pressed on. Pt states that the first 7 days after his vaccine there was no reaction, visibly, at all. He had a &#34;bit&#34; of soreness after shot, like he expected, then nothing until day 8.  He did use ice on the area from the 1/20/21 through 1/28/21, when he came to our office.  Nurse initially viewed area, had PA also look. PA felt after her examination that the area was urticarial, and prescribed prednisone and Benadryl orally, and advised pt to use hydrocortisone 1% cream up to 4 times daily. Pt returned the next day, area was much less red, smaller in size, and less swollen and hard.  He was advised to use Benadryl orally and hydrocortisone 1% topically, prophylactically, after his second injection.

This went on for 2 more days. Temperature ranged from 100.2 to 101.6.  Friday morning (2/5) woke with fever of 101 but soon dropped down to 99. As the day went on temperature became normal and has stayed that way. Lost 3 pounds and still feeling very tired.  Arm at injection site was swollen and very hard.

Same symptoms, though milder, persisted through 2/11 i.e. 10 days after vaccination. I am completing this form on behalf of my husband, who has vision problems.  We got our vaccination at the same time and place.  I had exactly the same symptoms at the same time, i.e. 9 and 10 days after vaccination.  (I don&#39;t plan to fill out a second report for myself - sorry!)

                                                Severe hives accompanied by shivering, significant itching,  three fainting  episodes close together about 8 hours after the onset of the hives and very low blood pressure following the fainting episode.  At home treatment taken on phone advise from Doctorr with Benadryl and Fomantadine with no effect.  Prednisone now prescribed.  Doctor had suggested a visit to ER but this was taken as the patient was more stable at this time.  Potential life threatening event due to the fainiting and low blood pressure/heart rate.  These symptoms have occured on previous occassions  as a result of virus and other infections.

                                                On 02/17/2021, patient received the second dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine in the left arm. Approximately 3 days post-administration, patient developed pain, swelling and erythema of the shoulder extending to the posterior/proximal anterior sections of the arm. Patient was unable to move arm due to swelling and presented to the Medical Center Emergency Department on 02/22/2021. A CT of the extremities revealed cellulitis, myositis, and possible fasciitis without abscesses. Subsequent MRI found myositis and cellulitis without evidence of osteomyelitis. Patient began to develop erthematous blotches and an Infectious disease consult was placed. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin). After cultures were obtained, patient was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. Two sets of blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics and a left arm swab showed no growth (finalized). On 02/26/2021 patient underwent incision and debridement of left arm with findings of edematous soft tissue without abscess or necrosis. On 02/28/2021 all antibiotics were discontinued per Infectious Disease provider due to lack of concern for infection.

In the afternoon, around 3:30pm he was in the bedroom to change clothes and got severely weak and fell.  He felt like he was going to vomit too.  He was so weak that he could not get up off the floor by himself.  My son lifted him up.  He also noticed Friday night that there was a bubble where the vaccine was given in his arm.  02/27/2021, the bubble had burst and liquid was coming out.  It was an open wound which was sore and really red.  He also had a headache and continued weakness.  02/28/2021, he still had a headache and the arm was sore.  03/01/2021, felt pretty good.

The patient took diphenhydramine and the hives disappeared that morning. Later that day, the patient developed difficulty breathing and the hives appeared on his left arm from the elbow to shoulder.  The patient went to the emergency room and was hospitalized overnight due to breathing issues. He was given diphenhydramine and steroids and was released from the hospital on 26 Jan 2021.    On 27 Jan 2021, the hives reappeared from the patient&#39;s hands, spreading to the arms, shoulders, head, neck, and face. He described some of the hives as being nearly a quarter-inch high and he stated they looked like water blisters.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient went to the emergency room again because he was having a lot of trouble breathing.   On an unknown date, the patient&#39;s legs had also itched but there were no spots.

He has very thin skin and suffered several skin tears.  We applied pressure and bandaged wounds and observed pt for 30 minutes.  He did not hit his head.  Followed up with pt&#39;s wife next day and she reported that his arm was sore, but no other complaints.  I recommended they see a Dr. for his skin tears.

When you scratch it it flakes off.  He has been putting on lotion to moisturize it and antiitch medicine hydrocortisone on it, and it stops the itching for a while but then it comes back.   Still having the same symptoms and has an appointment with his dermatologist on 2/11/21.  He said that it feels like dead skin that you can take your fingernails and just peel it off.

                                                Pt broke out in a rash over his entire the day after receiving the vax.  Pt had office visit w/ PCP on 1/20/2021 which was  then referred to a Dermatologist.  Doctor took biopsy that showed he was allergic to something and was told that it could be the vax but it could also be from something else as well.  Pt was told to change soaps and detergents.  He was prescribed Aquaphor healing ointment, Claritin,  Fluocinolone.  Pt still has the rash on his entire body.

These conditions lasted for one week, until my Orthopedist (whom I saw for follow-up knee replacement) prescribed a Medrol Doz-pak, which finally gave me relief.

Liquid oxycodone given and did not help much either.  Nebulizer given x 2.  More oxycodone given and after 1 hour was able breath easier but still struggled all night.  Refused to go to hospital due to not wanting to die in hospital.  Nebulizer given again at 3 am.  Arm and legs jerking really hard.  Boost given.  4 am fell asleep.  6 am did another nebulizer tx.  Oxycodone given.  Still struggling with breathing and albuterol.  Continued this  the next 10 days.  Slept in recliner every night.  SOB with activity and eating.  Went back and forth with walker to bathroom and did not have to use a walker prior.  Arm was very red and had a rash.  Also had a bad headach.  Called doctor and said to go to ER but refused due to not wanting to die in hospital.  28 days later is using Nebulizer 3 times a day instead of 6.  Now just started not using walker.  Was shoveling snow prior to shot.

He took those for almost 2 months without any problem until he got his shot.  He took his pill at 10:00 when he went to bed, woke him up around 12:30 AM and had severe itching all over his back, and his mouth, tooth area felt like they fell asleep.  Got some water and rinsed his mouth and felt that it was something he ate.  Again for the next 2 nights after taking his blood pressure medicine he was woken up with the same feeling (like it was asleep).  It did not affect his swallowing.  He then called his doctor and he put him back on his other medicine, and not having any trouble since switching back to Atenolol.  He is scheduled for the 2nd vaccine on 2/25/21.   Has an APT with his PCP 2/16/21.

It gradually disappeared over the following 3 days. In the 1st night after the injection, the immune system started fighting the vaccine, culminating in 39°C fever the following morning. Dozing in bed in polar dress under a triple blanket the entire day got the fever down to below 38°C. It was gone the next morning below 37°C.

                                                Shoulder area around injection site was swollen, inflamed, itchy and very warm to touch. My doctor looked at it and prescribed Z-pac antibiotic as he thought it might be infected. While the symptoms subsided a bit, they did not go away until after the antibiotic was used up. Since then I have had much loss of strength in both arms while trying to use them reaching above my head. I have to push my left arm up with my right hand to get dishes off the second shelf in the cupboard. The doctor then took blood samples and did a urine analysis but found nothing. He sent me to the ER to have a CT scan of the abdomin and IV fluids. While there they took more blood samples and found nothing. I am also having lower back pains

                                                Moderna COVID-19. Vaccine EUA Exactly 12 hours after my injection, 1:30 am, I awoke with a severe coughing attack. In addition, my chest was wheezing and felt as if &#34;bubbles&#34; were in my chest. My arm felt very hot and tender at the injection site. This attack lasted for half an hour. I went back to sleep and awoke the following morning feeling very weak and confused. Feeling extremely fatigued, all I wanted to do was sleep. I also lost my appetite. The next day, I had occasional coughing which subsided with my over the counter cough medicine.

I used Cortizone cream and took Benedryl.    Five days later my wife had a reaction in her arm, but it did  not swell , only got pink the size of an  lemon.    I only wanted to know if this was just a delayed reaction when I called your number, but was informed I needed to fill this form out &amp; call my doctor.  I never felt bad at any time.

                                                9 days after vaccination area of injection started itching and became red. A little bit warm also. There seems to be a small bump. Before that there were no symptoms whatsoever.  I do not feel any other reactions. Because of the original reaction to the vaccine which was none whatsoever, I was surprised by the redness and itching some 9 nine days later and decided to report it just in case it has some meaning.

                                                So around 1/30/2021 I started itching all over my body and little red color bumps starting to come to up. I still got some bumps but it seems like they are getting better.  I have tried to taking Benadryl.

                                                Squeezing headaches started Sunday afternoon and ended late Tuesday or Wednesday morning.  On Wednesday, I had what I thought was a bug bite on my forehead but my wife said it looked like a broken blister.  Thursday morning I had more blisters on the right side of my head (Forehead to the back of the my hairline).  and went to a doctor.  We all thought it ws a burn from a barbecue blow back on Sunday but the ophthalmologist a week later diagnosed it as Shingles.  A week later the wound care specialist also said it was shingles..  I am starting the 6th week of Shingles.

The skin has pimples on it and I&#39;ve had it for almost a week. I am putting cortisone cream on it to relieve the itching but so far it has done much to do so.

Started 5 days after injection at initial injection site, was as big as tennis ball and has increased substantially every day since. Used cortisone to subdue itching but went to pcp Dr to examine the site. She prescribed cetirizine and cephalexin for 5 days. Itching has stopped but rash is still large and present. Will revisit with Dr on 2/25/2021.

Symptoms did not improve and was later given Keflex 500mg PO Q6hr for possible cellulitis in setting of tinea pedis. First dose of vaccine was 29Jan2021.   Patient had second dose of MODERNA COVID-19 vaccine on 26Feb2021. About 48 hours after vaccination, he reported worsened swelling and redness at his left ankle (in setting of improvement since starting antibiotics). The recurrence of redness and swelling started to improve about 6 days later, where he came back to Internal medicine clinic for repeat evaluation.

                                                Nine days after receiving the shot, patient broke out in hives on his abdomen. The hospital told him to take Benadryl which did not reduce the hives. The hives continued to spread over his abdomen and become itchier. On day 11 after the shot, his lips began to swell. On day 12, January 26, he went to the emergency room due to the lip swelling and hives. They prescribed 10mg Cetirizine HCL twice per day. He took it for three days. The lip swelling went down and the hives started to subside the day he started to take the Cetirizine.  Note: He had two hives appear on his chest within 24 hours of the second dose. That was COVID-19 (Moderna) 013M20A on February 11, 2021. He immediately took the Citirizine for three days and they did not get any worse and cleared up.

Within a few hours, my left hand began to tingle and my right leg felt stiff. I experienced a loss of balance that made walking difficult.  For the next 24 hours I became very fatigued. But two days after the vaccination, I have begun to regain my strength.

When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.
