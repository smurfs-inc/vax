At 4AM I went to sleep.  I contactedmy dermatologist.  He suggested the vaccine may have started a Grover&#39;s response.  He asked that I add Zyrtec (over the counter) to my meds.  He asked that I continue hydrating my skin with Vanicream cream.  I folllowed his advice.  The itching stopped on Sunday.  I continued with the Zyrtec but stopped the Gabapintin.   Today, Tuesday, I am having muscle tightening, especially in my legs.

Then, 7 days after receiving vaccine, I developed a pruritic swelling a few inches below injection site.  Next day (day 8) noted 4-5&#34; diameter area of slight swelling and erythema below injection site.  Pruritis  became mild ache. No warmth.  Note: when I received vaccine there was a little acute bleeding from injection site,  then over next few days I developed a 2&#34; diameter dark ecchymosis at site, still present on day 10, possibly lighter.  On day 10 note minimal swelling and erythema extending dow n from injection site in a rough triangle ~ 5-6&#34; high with apex just below injection site, seems to be resolving.

The rash is almost completely gone, and chills and weak feeling resolved when the patient woke the next day.

I reported it to public health the day after onset, but they never called back to get the appropriate information. It resolved with no after effects, but I saw an article today that it was an uncommon reaction (&#34;delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity&#34;), but thought I would report it for your data base. I&#39;d be interested if this should cause any concern regarding the second injection, like getting it in the other arm.

                                                Beginning approximately 72 hours after receiving his first dose of the Moderna, he noted redness around the injection site of the left arm. He said the area felt warm to the touch and was slightly itchy. This lasted for 3-4 days before it resolved on its own without treatment.  Today (13 days post vaccination) he noted the rash on the left arm return but it was fainter than when it first came up around 72 hours after vaccination. He states the area today is 3.5 inches by 1.5 inches in size on the left arm only.  He denies other symptoms or changes in  skin care routine.

                                                Several days after receiving my vaccination with the Moderna product I developed a significant rash of both hands on the dorsal side. It is non-blanching and it&#39;s only mildly tender and itchy. It was on my neck a little initially, but that has cleared.

                                                One week after the second shot I started to get bumps on my neck, that was on a Friday night.  By Sunday it was much worse so I went to the emergency care facility and the Dr. told me I had shingles and prescribed  Valacyclovir for 7 days.  I reached out to people on an App and explained my side effect.  There were over 9 people that also had the shingles after the second dose.  They didn&#39;t necessarily get the shot from the same pharmacy.   It is obvious that there is a direct correlation between the two.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

I had my doctor check it in case it was infected  or a reaction  from the vaccine.  He felt it was a reaction to the vaccine.  The site doesn&#39;t hurt and it&#39;s not warm.  The site isn&#39;t changing from when I first noticed it 2 weeks ago.

The outside of my upper arm was itchy and I rubbed it and scratched it a little and the itchiness seemed to be centered at the injection site. The itchiness lasted for about 3 days. I have not been itchy today which is the 4th day so it seems to have gone away. It was not irritating me all of the time, I could concentrate on other things and be oblivious to it. But sometimes when I rubbed it I could feel a little bit of swelling again at the injection site. When I looked at it there was some redness that could have been caused by my rubbing or scratching, some redness on the skin.  I tried to located swelling when it first appeared but couldn&#39;t find any and I didn&#39;t notice any that was worrying.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It didn&#39;t itch, it hurt when something was dragged over it, like a finger or clothing.  It was deep, deep red and some parts of his body there was no regular skin showing.  Took him to ER, where tests were run, showing his liver counts were way off.  Biopsy was taken of the rash.  It was determined that the rash was similar to Stevens-Johnson and he was admitted for 2.5 days.  They put him on large doses of steroids, which helped the rash.  All labs were headed in the right direction except his liver panel.  He was sent home and returned to doctor in 3 days to run panels again.  All were headed in right direction, even the liver.  He will see his cardiologist to be put back on his heart medicines.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

                                                Only mild tenderness at injection site first two days after first dose Moderna vaccination on Jan 20, 2021.  No other side effects noticed and felt fine.  8 days later on Jan 28, developed a large elongated 4&#34; by 2&#34; itchy red rash at the injection site (upper left arm). As of today Jan 31, 3 days later, I still have the rash and so far not diminishing. Feel fine otherwise, no fever or pain,  just annoying and unsightly rash.

Around that same time the patient sprayed his home with pest control. Patient called his PCP and reported that they could not tell if the rash was from the bug spray or the Moderna vaccine. The patient&#39;s PCP advised him it would be fine for him to receive his second vaccine, but to take Zytec 10mg x1 the day of his second vaccine and to observed for 30 minutes after that vaccine was given. Patient did not have any problems immediately after the second moderna vaccine on 2/1/2021.

However, a week ago I developed a rash on my right foot &amp; lower leg.  It got worse and so I visited with my dermatologist. He immediately diagnosed it as SHINGLES.  The only reason I can think of that brought the attack on seems to be the vaccine??  I?m scheduled for the second booster shot on Feb 11th and quite frankly, I?m worried.    Have other vaccinated folks complained about getting Shingles?  Do you have information about getting the second shot and how that affects getting Shingles?  Thanks for your assistance.

He could not sleep on it at night as he felt like he was sleeping on a red hot pocker.  On Saturday he was extremely tired in the afternoon.  Had to come in from yard work as he could not function.  He also had pain in his neck and shoulders.  On Sunday he the feelings were going away, but his muscles started aching.  On Monday he felt really strange, felt like he was in a fog, and his muscles ached.  He could not get relaxed, did his normal Monday chores, laundry and house cleaning.  He then tried to relax but his muscles and nerves were very tense.  He went to bed around 9:30 on Monday, fell asleep and awoke at 2:00 AM and could not go back to sleep his muscles in his arms and legs were in spasm and his arm would jump like a shock reaction and jump off of the mattress, as well as his leg.  It was worse on the left side than the right arm.  This went on every 10-15 minutes for about 3-4 hours.  Around 4:00 AM this morning it eased off to sleep and woke up at 10 and felt better today.  He hasn&#39;t had any more of the seizure type feelings in his arms or legs.  He did speak with Moderna who told him that he was the 4th one with this reaction and to report this to us.

                                                I had Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on Wednesday February 3 at 11:30 AM . After the vaccine I went home and had virtually no pain. Around 10PM that night I felt some pain in the toes on my left foot. When I looked, I noticed that my toes were red and appeared slightly swollen.   My big toe was the worst. It was sensitive to the touch and very red. I also felt a short intermittent sharp pain that would last a second or two. It would happen every 3-4 minutes. The next day the redness was gone on all but my big toe.  As I write this today Saturday February 6 at at 11 AM. My big toe is still sore, but does appear a bit better.

They did a biopsy on the area on right leg and I feel like ants are crawling all over me and biting. on my back there&#39;s no redness but it feels like ants biting and itching. the doctor&#39;s stated there&#39;s no bacterial or fungal infection. This attack is from the knee down both arms and back only and the doctor had no other treatment for it other than cortisone cream and nothing seems to stop it.

Moderna Dose #2:   About 7 hours post-injection I experienced a temperature (101 F peak) and mild chills, a short-term mild headache, mild muscle /joint aches, and an ache at the injection site.  These effects lasted for about 36 hours and then were gone.  I would compare them to a mild 2-day case of the flu.

(Vaccine was given approx 1:40pm) lasted about 30 minutes then it calmed down to more normal heart rate. Next morning bad headache 5-10am. Took Tylenol for it. Also, pain at injection site, across shoulder and lower neck for approx 24 hours after shot.

Was given Tylenol and temp went up to 104.  She called the doctor at 2:00 PM, told her to see the doctor.  Lethargy and weakness.  Tested him for COVID and flu and still had fever.  Was negative for both, told to alternate Tylenol and Ibuprofen, went down to 102.  At 6:30 PM went up to 103.8, at that point she called the doctor, could not speak to him until 6:45 PM instructed to bath down with warm rag, and was told it was probably a reaction to the vaccine.  Was called in a steroid pack.  He went to bed running about 103.6 at 8:30 PM.  Was able to get up, was given more Tylenol/Ibuprofen and his fever finally broke around 101 about 4:00 AM.  Got up this morning and does feel better.  Running around 100-101 temp.  The vaccine is the only thing that has been different in his normal routine.  Still has warmth to the injection site, red.

At home treatment taken on phone advise from Doctorr with Benadryl and Fomantadine with no effect.  Prednisone now prescribed.  Doctor had suggested a visit to ER but this was taken as the patient was more stable at this time.  Potential life threatening event due to the fainiting and low blood pressure/heart rate.

Approximately 3 days post-administration, patient developed pain, swelling and erythema of the shoulder extending to the posterior/proximal anterior sections of the arm. Patient was unable to move arm due to swelling and presented to the Medical Center Emergency Department on 02/22/2021. A CT of the extremities revealed cellulitis, myositis, and possible fasciitis without abscesses. Subsequent MRI found myositis and cellulitis without evidence of osteomyelitis. Patient began to develop erthematous blotches and an Infectious disease consult was placed. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin). After cultures were obtained, patient was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. Two sets of blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics and a left arm swab showed no growth (finalized). On 02/26/2021 patient underwent incision and debridement of left arm with findings of edematous soft tissue without abscess or necrosis. On 02/28/2021 all antibiotics were discontinued per Infectious Disease provider due to lack of concern for infection.

He took those for almost 2 months without any problem until he got his shot.  He took his pill at 10:00 when he went to bed, woke him up around 12:30 AM and had severe itching all over his back, and his mouth, tooth area felt like they fell asleep.  Got some water and rinsed his mouth and felt that it was something he ate.  Again for the next 2 nights after taking his blood pressure medicine he was woken up with the same feeling (like it was asleep).  It did not affect his swallowing.  He then called his doctor and he put him back on his other medicine, and not having any trouble since switching back to Atenolol.  He is scheduled for the 2nd vaccine on 2/25/21.   Has an APT with his PCP 2/16/21.

In addition, my chest was wheezing and felt as if &#34;bubbles&#34; were in my chest. My arm felt very hot and tender at the injection site. This attack lasted for half an hour. I went back to sleep and awoke the following morning feeling very weak and confused. Feeling extremely fatigued, all I wanted to do was sleep. I also lost my appetite. The next day, I had occasional coughing which subsided with my over the counter cough medicine.

I used Cortizone cream and took Benedryl.    Five days later my wife had a reaction in her arm, but it did  not swell , only got pink the size of an  lemon.    I only wanted to know if this was just a delayed reaction when I called your number, but was informed I needed to fill this form out &amp; call my doctor.  I never felt bad at any time.

On Wednesday, I had what I thought was a bug bite on my forehead but my wife said it looked like a broken blister.  Thursday morning I had more blisters on the right side of my head (Forehead to the back of the my hairline).  and went to a doctor.  We all thought it ws a burn from a barbecue blow back on Sunday but the ophthalmologist a week later diagnosed it as Shingles.  A week later the wound care specialist also said it was shingles..  I am starting the 6th week of Shingles.

Started 5 days after injection at initial injection site, was as big as tennis ball and has increased substantially every day since. Used cortisone to subdue itching but went to pcp Dr to examine the site. She prescribed cetirizine and cephalexin for 5 days. Itching has stopped but rash is still large and present. Will revisit with Dr on 2/25/2021.

It was initially treated as potential gout through the Emergency Room with low dose prednisone burst. Symptoms did not improve and was later given Keflex 500mg PO Q6hr for possible cellulitis in setting of tinea pedis. First dose of vaccine was 29Jan2021.   Patient had second dose of MODERNA COVID-19 vaccine on 26Feb2021. About 48 hours after vaccination, he reported worsened swelling and redness at his left ankle (in setting of improvement since starting antibiotics). The recurrence of redness and swelling started to improve about 6 days later, where he came back to Internal medicine clinic for repeat evaluation.

                                                I did have and still have soreness of shoulder where I got the injection. That I can expect to stay. When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.
