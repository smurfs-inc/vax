At 4AM I went to sleep.  I contactedmy dermatologist.  He suggested the vaccine may have started a Grover&#39;s response.  He asked that I add Zyrtec (over the counter) to my meds.  He asked that I continue hydrating my skin with Vanicream cream.  I folllowed his advice.  The itching stopped on Sunday.  I continued with the Zyrtec but stopped the Gabapintin.   Today, Tuesday, I am having muscle tightening, especially in my legs.

Extreme pain in area of left arm/shoulder where the vaccine was given. Arm severely ached for 48 hours in any position, was very tender/painful to touch, and difficult to use or move. I&#39;m pretty tough where pain is concerned with past injuries (broken leg in 17 pieces, severely sprained ankles, broken ribs, broken tail bone from horse accident.

I reported it to public health the day after onset, but they never called back to get the appropriate information. It resolved with no after effects, but I saw an article today that it was an uncommon reaction (&#34;delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity&#34;), but thought I would report it for your data base. I&#39;d be interested if this should cause any concern regarding the second injection, like getting it in the other arm.

Medical history included being mentally challenged. Concomitant medication included unspecified cholesterol medication, two unspecified blood pressure medications, baby aspirin, vitamin D, and lorazepam.  On 04 Feb 2020, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 05 Feb 2021, the patient experienced bleeding from a pencil eraser red looking spot on the right ankle, had lost a lot of blood.  The bleeding had stopped and no treatment was reported.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event of hemorrhage was considered resolved. The outcome of the event erythema was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Further information has been requested.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

                                                Notice minor sensitivity when touch injection site.  Some swelling and slight redness around the injection site and site is warm.  I am also aware of slight itching feeling.  I do not have fever.  None of these are severe but rather I am aware of them and wonder if I should still experience them since I received the first dose on 1/7/2021.  Do I need to be concerned or contact my primary physician?

                                                felt like crap; became hot; left hand suddenly started jerking and left hand was having spasms; Vasovagal Syncope, Post Immunization Reaction; became cold; sweaty; sore arm; achy; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 77-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction (syncope vasovagal).  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

At home treatment taken on phone advise from Doctorr with Benadryl and Fomantadine with no effect.  Prednisone now prescribed.  Doctor had suggested a visit to ER but this was taken as the patient was more stable at this time.  Potential life threatening event due to the fainiting and low blood pressure/heart rate.  These symptoms have occured on previous occassions  as a result of virus and other infections.

Approximately 3 days post-administration, patient developed pain, swelling and erythema of the shoulder extending to the posterior/proximal anterior sections of the arm. Patient was unable to move arm due to swelling and presented to the Medical Center Emergency Department on 02/22/2021. A CT of the extremities revealed cellulitis, myositis, and possible fasciitis without abscesses. Subsequent MRI found myositis and cellulitis without evidence of osteomyelitis. Patient began to develop erthematous blotches and an Infectious disease consult was placed. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin). After cultures were obtained, patient was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. Two sets of blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics and a left arm swab showed no growth (finalized). On 02/26/2021 patient underwent incision and debridement of left arm with findings of edematous soft tissue without abscess or necrosis. On 02/28/2021 all antibiotics were discontinued per Infectious Disease provider due to lack of concern for infection.

The patient&#39;s medical history included afib (atrial fibrillation). Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included finasteride, warfarin, sotalol, simvastatin, mesalamine, metoprolol, and oxygen.   On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient reported that he felt a little nausea for the first few days after vaccine administration.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 1:00 AM with hives on his right arm from the elbow to the shoulder. He stated the hives were painful to touch. The patient took diphenhydramine and the hives disappeared that morning. Later that day, the patient developed difficulty breathing and the hives appeared on his left arm from the elbow to shoulder.  The patient went to the emergency room and was hospitalized overnight due to breathing issues. He was given diphenhydramine and steroids and was released from the hospital on 26 Jan 2021.    On 27 Jan 2021, the hives reappeared from the patient&#39;s hands, spreading to the arms, shoulders, head, neck, and face. He described some of the hives as being nearly a quarter-inch high and he stated they looked like water blisters.

                                                The injection site began to hurt the evening of the day of the injection.  I did not sleep well that night and was generally achy and fatigued the next day.  Additionally I had a very dry mouth .  By that evening I began to feel better although I was still a little tired but by the next day began to feel normal.  The injection site is still tender (day 3) but getting better.

                                                Rash at the injection site almost down  to elbow and around to the underside of the arm with extreme itching. Started 5 days after injection at initial injection site, was as big as tennis ball and has increased substantially every day since. Used cortisone to subdue itching but went to pcp Dr to examine the site. She prescribed cetirizine and cephalexin for 5 days. Itching has stopped but rash is still large and present. Will revisit with Dr on 2/25/2021.

Within a few hours, my left hand began to tingle and my right leg felt stiff. I experienced a loss of balance that made walking difficult.  For the next 24 hours I became very fatigued. But two days after the vaccination, I have begun to regain my strength.

                                                I did have and still have soreness of shoulder where I got the injection. That I can expect to stay. When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.
