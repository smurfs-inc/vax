                                                Right after the injection, I felt an electric shock feeling in my hand. This was followed by right hand numbness  and tingling in the entire hand. This symptoms of numbness and tingling decreased in severity, but now has been stable: every day, I am experiencing numbness of the right hand, extending from my wrist and involving my palm and my pinky and ring finger.  The feeling is not decreased by Tylenol.

I had severe body aches, headache, muscle weakness, worse cough, injection site pain and swelling, chills, weakness/tiredness,  I felt like I had been hit by a car. I just tried to sleep and drink Gator Aid. The second day out from vaccination I felt much better. Just slight headache, body aches,  weakness.  My injection site started to hurt later in the second day. It still hurts today-seven days out from administration.

Took Prednisone for the next 7 days with hydroxixyne which totally alleviated all symptoms. Also I went to my Primary Care MD for f/u. After treatment hives started again, then I started to take benadryl orally which kept my symptoms in check but today it came back worse again despite medication.

He also stated that his arm was very painful after the injection.

                                                About eight hours after the injection, I noticed some hearing impairment in my left ear.  Sounds are muffled, almost as if I have water trapped in the ear canal.  I noticed this right before I went to bed, and the hearing loss is still present and similar in magnitude this morning.  There is no pain, and the hearing in my right ear seems to be normal, although I can&#39;t rule out some slight loss on that side.  Aside from a slightly sore arm at the injection site, I&#39;ve had no other side effects (e.g., no fever) from the vaccination.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

He had bloodwork done 48 hrs after vaccination prior to giving blood. He was told that he was &#34;positive for HIV and leukemia&#34; based on that bloodwork. He was then seen by PCP and had repeat labs which were normal. He denies any further symptoms. The PCP attributed the false positive lab results to having the COVID vaccine 48 hrs prior to initial labwork.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included preexisting conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. No relevant concomitants were reported.   On unk Feb 2021 (during the first week of February), prior to onset of symptoms, the patient received their first dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 026L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for the prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   On unknown date, the patient experienced a rash, but no other reaction. He reported taking no other medication when he had  received his first dose.   On 17 Feb 2021, the patient was hospitalized for his pre-existing conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. He was discharged on 21 Feb 2021. No treatment information was provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, rash, pre-existing heart failure and kidney failure red, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality the serious events kidney failure and heart failure are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 but possibly related to the consumer&#39;s pre-existing conditions of renal failure and cardiac failure, while the non-serious event of rash may be possibly related to mRNA-1273.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine on Monday 1/11/21. There was swelling and pain at the injection site which lasted about 4 days. There was NO redness or rash at the injection site for a week. On 1/18/21 in the evening, suddenly a rash appeared which was warmer than the surrounding area. It was tender and about the size of a half dollar. It rapidly grew in size, on 1/20/21 it is now about 3x3.5 inches across and is still growing. I have called the Public Health Dept where I got the vaccination, without getting a response (3 times). I called Moderna, and was given a case Number: MOD21-09316. Batch number was 025J20-2A. They were not able to tell me anything beyond what I could read online. (It is odd that my injection site reaction was delayed a week.) I emailed my doctor and attached a photo. I am waiting to hear back.

                                                Pt received 1st dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 01/04/2021 in L deltoid. Came back to clinic at 0800 on 01/06/2021 c/o excruciating pain in entire L arm radiating to neck, chest, and around his upper and lower back. States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

                                                Within 24 hours, I began experiencing bouts of severe pruritis starting in the lower extremities. Rash developed in areas of excoriation due to severe itching, pinpoint red macules.  The episodes of pruritis were not responsive to Benadryl Zyrtec or Claritin. For two nights I took Vistaril with mild relief. Medrol dose pack was ineffective. Over the next week the episodes increased in intensity and frequency and were often accompanied by localized redness and superficial swelling of the skin and hive like raised areas of the skin as in urticaria. The areas of localized pruritis migrated  over a period  lasting  7 to 10 days,  first to inner surfaces of both my arms, then to my lower back, and then to my upper back over scapulae and shoulders. Concurrently, the pruritis and rash began resolving in the lower extremities and then on the inner aspect of my upper extremities. Currently,  the intensity and frequency of the pruritis has decreased significantly  and is now localized to my upper back.   Yesterday was the first day that I did not require antihistamines.

It is 90% better at the time of this report approximately 4 days after the first symptoms.

                                                Injection was given very close to the shoulder joint in my left arm, as a result within a few hours a very sharp pain in my shoulder caused me to be unable to lift my left arm without extreme pain, not muscle pain. By 4:00 pm I was sapped of energy. During the night I developed chills and ran a fever of 100.4 F. By Sunday morning I felt nauseous, but did not vomit. At 2:00pm 12/10/2020 my fever has lowered and the nausea has subsided, but the shoulder joint is still very sore.

Discomfort lasted 3 -4 days  About 7 days after injection a very itchy rash developed on my left arm, chest, and right arm. The rash are small, prickly red spots that cover most of the area on my arms and upper chest.  It is so itchy that I broke the skin while scratching in my sleep. I googled the condition and find that my symptoms do not match most others as it is not localized at the injection site.

I was concerned until I read a helpful article at website which said to report it to you, assist you with research. The article says it goes away in 3-7 days, so I will mark &#34;No&#34; under &#34;is patient recovered&#34; below, as it has not yet.

I did not go to the ER and my wife has the lot number in her purse with her right now.

                                                This is to report my reaction to the Covid19 vaccination. Yesterday, January 26, 2021, I took the Covid19 vaccination at 2:50 pm. Around 10:00 pm I started to feel soreness running up my arm to my shoulder and down to my forearm from the injection site. All night, the pain kept getting worse. By 3:00 am the pain reached a level 8 with any movement jumping to an intolerable level 10, the worst pain I&#39;ve ever experienced from any vaccination I&#39;ve ever have taken. Needless to say, I was in pain all night. I have no other symptoms at this time. Should I be concerned?

HCP approached vehicle where a 68yo white male was sitting in his vehicle on the driver side. Quick assessment revealed erythema of the face and angioedema. Pt was able to speak clearly, was CTA and had RRR. 911 was called. BP 160/90.  EpiPen dose 1 was injected into right vastus lateralis and pt reported improvement at 1057.  HCP asked for injectable diphenhydramine. HCP continued to monitor pt with RRR and CTA but erythema and angioedema began again along with swollen tongue so EpiPen dose 2 was injected into right vastus lateralis. 50mg IM diphenhydramine was injected into the right deltoid while fire rescue began to arrive on scene. Pt did not report difficulty breathing. Pt did report previous anaphylaxis to fire ant bites/stings and did report being allergic to bee stings. Fire rescue transported patient without difficulty. HCP called pt later that night at 2030 who reported doing better but still having tongue swelling.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                Two days after injection a small circle of redness below the skin developed at the injection site.  The circle continued to expand over the next 12 days.  It is now about the size of a grapefruit.  The area is slightly warm to the touch and tends to be a little itchy at times.  It does  not seem to be healing.  Should I seek medical attention?

                                                After receiving the 1st dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine about 11:30 am on 2/18/21: 1. About 4:00 pm that same afternoon I started to feel some soreness around the injection area and a slight headache. 2. By about 7:00 pm that same evening the soreness and headache had increased and I was feeling general body achiness. It was much worse sitting or standing so I ate a small dinner and then went to bed to lie down. I felt much better to be prone. 3. I normally go to sleep between 11 pm to 1 am but fell asleep around 8:20 pm. When I go to sleep that early I often wake up during the night and will be awake for a few hours before falling asleep again. That is what happened. I slept about 3.5 to 4 hours then was up for about 3 hours then went to sleep again for about 3 to 4 hours. I think I got about 7 hours sleep which was good since my typical is about 6 hours. 4. I woke up the morning of one day after and still felt the same, that is, my arm was very sore, and somewhat swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness, and it was worse sitting and standing and much better lying down prone. Other than getting something to eat I stayed prone most of the day until later afternoon when I did manage to be sitting up for several hours. 5. By the time I went to sleep that night, again a little earlier than normal but maybe around 10 pm, my arm was very sore, and pretty swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness. 6. By the time I awoke on the morning two days after the vaccination, that is 2/20/21, everything was reduced but still there, that is, my arm was still sore and swollen but much less from the peak, and I had a mild headache and the body aches were pretty much gone. 7. By the time I awoke on the morning of 3 days after, that is 2/21/21, I felt normal.

                                                Developed a hard rather large welt red swollen bump 4&#34; below left breast nipple and an additional smaller one 1&#34; to the right and redness trailing downward and to the sides.  I was in the 15 minute waiting area they send you to after you receive the shot.  I first noticed an itching and then felt the welt under my shirt, stuck my hand in my shirt and felt the welt developing.  Concerned, I approached the two paramedics there and they looked at it and said it looked like a bug bite but I am pretty sure it is not a bug bite and that is related to the vaccine. It&#39;s two days later and the welt is still there although smaller but still hard and still itching and sensitive to the touch but the redness that was extending outward is gone and now it consists of the main bump and the smaller one only.  The smaller one looks like a big pimple and the large one is about 1/2 &#34; in diameter with redness around that.  When researching on the internet I stumbled on this site and thought I needed to report it and am still wondering if it is anything serious.

I am only reporting this because the clinic gave us a card to use with a smart phone to report any different occurrence.  I do not have a smart phone so I am using this approach, in case you want this information.

                                                Upon waking at about 7a.m. on 1/1/21,  I stood up and stepped with the right leg; as the left leg followed I experienced acute pain in the left hip joint and the leg buckled under weight. I hobbled/hopped to the hall as the pain moved predominately to the left calf as I leaned on the wall for support rubbing both thigh and calf and yelling to my wife.Over a few minutes, I regained mobility and have not experienced that since. I have had discomfort(sharp aching) in the left hip joint and left calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to have a numbing/tingling from the injection site down to my left elbow as well as down the left side of my leg. There&#39;s a general feeling of &#34;weakness&#34; in my upper left arm. I&#39;ve reported this to our Infection Control Nurse (who administered the vaccination) anecdotally after waiting a few weeks to see if things went away. Her advisement was to go ahead and report in to VAERS.

The patient&#39;s medical history included a kidney transplant. Concomitant product use was not provided.   On 19 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 029L20A) in the left arm for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.   The patient had some mild soreness at the site of the injection which lasted one to two days. On 21 Jan 2021, he experienced some ear ringing in his right ear which was followed by hearing loss that lasted six hours. Both the ear ringing and hearing loss resolved by the next morning.   On 24 Jan 2021, the patient had ringing in his left ear, but it was not associated with hearing loss. The patient stated he thinks the tromethamine hydrochloride in the vaccine may have induced his hearing loss. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, hearing loss in right ear and ear ringing in right ear, were considered resolved on 22 Jan 2021. The event, mild soreness at the site of injection, was considered resolved on an unknown date Jan 2021. The outcome for the event, ringing in left ear, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71- year old male patient who experienced hearing loss in right ear/deafness unilateral, ear ringing in right ear/tinnitus, ringing in left ear/tinnitus, and mild soreness at the site of injection/injection site pain, all within 4 days after administration of Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273). Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I felt fine the next morning save fore some soreness just below the injection site.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

Then, 12 days after the vaccination, a red rash started to be seen at the area where the injection was. That area felt warm. The nest two days, including today, the rash started to spread, covering a major part of the upper part of my arm. The arm is warm to the touch. I plan to go to a medical clinic tomorrow, as I am now, visiting my daughter and grandchildren, until January 24.

(&#43;) dermatographia. Over the last week there has been some improvement but 2 new papules developed on L inner thigh and R upper arm. No treatment. as it didn&#39;t bother me enough. Saw my dermatologist yesterday for routine f/u and he confirmed that Dermatologists are seeing an urticarial rash 1-3 weeks after the vaccine.. The question is: should I get the second shot in a week?

The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

                                                Awakened from sound sleep in morning of January 6th (~8 days post vaccination) with intense pruritis (itching) of left shoulder and arm (injection site  and bicep region). When I arose in the morning, I noticed a wide (approximately 3-inch  band) of erythema (redness) extending from injection site in left shoulder and extending along outer aspect of bicep to about 2 inches above antecubital fossa (bend of elbow).   I applied roll-on topical anesthetic (4% lidocaine) and 1% hydrocortisone cream, which diminished but did not completely eliminate the itching. Last night, I added OTC Benadryl 25 mg orally, 1 dose. Today, itching is less, but still present. On upper left arm and shoulder the erythema is slightly less, while redness is more intense, but sharply demarcated  at the base of the bicep  (about 1 inch above the elbow crease.    Seems likely this is a delayed allergic reaction. Unless instructed otherwise, will likely not proceed with second dose of vaccine.

                                                Transverse myelitis with GAD enhancing lesion on MRI C3-C5. Strength was 5/5 symmetrically in the lower extremities, but he had significant weakness in the upper extremities left worse than right. Generally 4-/5 proximally on the right, 4/5 distally; left deltoid, biceps, triceps were 2-3/5, 4-/5 at the wrist and hand. Sensation is largely impaired on the right in a patchy distribution to light touch, temperature, pinprick, vibratory (impaired significantly on the right) and proprioception. Romberg testing was positive.

I awoke with a bit of swelling, light redness, and a slight itch at the vaccination site.  I understand this is called &#34;COVID arm&#34; and am only reporting it for research purposes.  The swelling has not increased and I have no real pain.  I have no concerns about this reaction.

                                                I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for covid 19 on December 9, 2020 as a participant in the study program.  I am a board crtified family physician. Beginning about 12 hours after the Moderna vaccine, I became fatigued, feverish (99.1) , ached in the thighs and calves, and had a 2-3 hour salty taste triggering thirst. The injection site became very tender but there was no inflammation nor rash.   All symptoms resolved on awakening 9:00 am 1/8/21.

He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet. Denies difficulty with swallowing, breathing or speech. No shooting pains down his legs, no change in sensation in saddle area, no loss of control of bowel or urinary movements.
