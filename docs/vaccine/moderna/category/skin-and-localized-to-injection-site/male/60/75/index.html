Significant lethargy all day 1/22/2021. Pain/nausea gone by 6PM but lethargy remained.  Slept most of the day. Symptoms gone by following morning (1/23/2021), so roughly 36 hours.

I simply wish to share my reaction for the sake of the statistics. The evening after I took the first shot of the vaccine I had a hard red bump on my arm near the injection site. My arm ached that night, and was notably better already in the morning, without aches the following day. The blister was gone the next day. I&#39;m relatively healthy, trail run and get strenuous exercise usually  twice a week.

                                                Injection was put in the fatty tissue and not in the actual muscle tissue  - it may have been administered too low in my arm. Everything was fine for first five days - and I noticed where the shot mark was and I noticed a lighter ring around it and about 3 or 4 days later - ring around it that was four inches in size- it was warm to the touch; swollen. Inner part was bright red and about five inches out it was lighter - it looked like an infection. I sent a photo to my doctor and asked him and was put on antibiotic  - about a week - just in case. It may have helped a little - after the antibiotics, I could still see it was there (although no swelling anymore).

                                                A few days after my first dosage, I started getting incredible itching all over my back, as well as some on my arms and chest. I tried to ignor it but I found myself scratching and scratching. I tried all sorts of creams and washes. I hadn?t changed any soap or clothes. I put in for a dermatologist consult with my PCP. I couldn?t imagine this was from the vaccination so I hadn?t even brought it up. I finally got a derm appt for 01/25/2021.  My first Moderna vaccine was 01/27/2021 and my second Moderna vaccine was 01/24/2021. When I went to my first appt, I was told it appeared to be allergic. I did not even tell her that I had the second Moderna vaccine the day before because I didn?t think there could be a connection. I had a derm f/u on 03/25/2021. The allergic rash was no longer diffuse but in patches, mostly on back and some on chest. She thought is could be eczema, something I never had on my body. A biopsy was taken.

In March 2021, Blood lactate dehydrogenase (122-222): 381 (High) high. In March 2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) Findings consistent with pulmonary edema.. In March 2021, Glomerular filtration rate: 19 (Low) eGFR - 19. In March 2021, International normalised ratio: 1.13 (Inconclusive) INR - 1.13. In March 2021, Platelet count: 84000 (Low) 84000/uL. In March 2021, Serum ferritin (24-336): 2400 (High) 2400 mg/ml. In March 2021, Ultrasound liver: abnormal (abnormal) Ultrasound of the liver confirmed liver cirrhosis..     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter considered THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia) and PURPURA (Purpuric rash) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation), NAUSEA (nausea), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools), PYREXIA (Fever) and CHILLS (Chills).    Concomitant medications were not provided.  Hepatitis panel showed a heavy viral load of more than 11 (no reference range was provided).  Per reporter, on presentation to the emergency room the patient was afebrile, had a blood pressure 183/106 mmHg, pulse rate of 82 per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Treatment included anti-hypertensives and intravenous diuretics. On day 3 of hospitalization, patient left the hospital against medical advice.  Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273. However, the reporter also indicated it could have been precipitated by the underlying thrombocytopenia, liver cirrhosis and Hepatitis C infection.

                                                10 days after receiving vaccine I experience spread hives and throat itchiness. Went to ED. Took Prednisone for the next 7 days with hydroxixyne which totally alleviated all symptoms. Also I went to my Primary Care MD for f/u. After treatment hives started again, then I started to take benadryl orally which kept my symptoms in check but today it came back worse again despite medication.

                                                February 2, I developed 30 red, raised, itchy welts all over my body, including arms, legs, back stomach. Welts were dime sized. No breathing difficulty,  Began benadryl 50 mg q 6 hours  around the clock for one week. Benadryl did not cause the welts to subside.  Welts worsened into larger 2x2 areas of redness and itching.   Contacted my physician, who prescribed a medrol dose pak.  Took from 2/1 to 2/5.  Welts improved but did not go away.  2/10/2021 - welts are still developing, Have 6 new welts today 2/10/21... taking benadryl but not improving .  Will call my doc back this date

I did not receive an automated ?health check-in? text today so I was unable to report it. The size of the swelling has not changed but there is a constant itch.

I woke up at 2:30 a.m. and thought I&#39;d been hit by a truck, my whole body was aching like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced. I also got chills and was shaking I thought I was on one of those machines that shake paint cans. I also had (and still do) a headache. The body aches subsided about 10:00 p.m. (03/03/2021). It is now about 5:00 p.m. on Thursday 03/04/2021 and I still have a slight headache and I am fatigued but starting to get some energy. On my left arm where I got my shot it is very warm, red, and about the size of a goose egg in the area I got the shot.

But  about Friday, my  right hand began to ache a bit. It became excruciating by Sunday.  My right elbow and my right ribs also hurt, but the joints in my right hand were on fire. I could not open, close, or flex it without severe joint pain. It was sore even to the touch especially at the joints.  The hand appeared to be a bit swollen as well. I took ibuprofen and it helped a bit. By Monday morning it was much better, but my hand still aches some.

                                                After first shot in series, I developed slight headache, minor weakness, minor shoulder pain.    After second shot in series, 8 hours post-injection, I developed headache, moderate to severe joint pain throughout, fever around 100, extreme fatigue and weakness, slight difficulty breathing.  Went to bed for 19 hours and began to feel better with recovery in two days.  14 days post-injection, I developed a systemic rash throughout my body. Consulted with my PC physician. Was prescribed  Medrol Dose Pack.  This had very minor effect on rash.  Returned to physician for consult upon completion of steroid series.  I then received a steroid shot intramuscular in right hip and one week oral steroid protocol.  This achieved a more positive result, almost clearing up the rash.  I had a consult with a dermatologist on 03/02/2021 who confirmed the opinion that the rash was probably a side effect of the Moderna vaccine.  The rash has returned fully as of 3/14/2021.

                                                Woke from sleep at 12:45 a.m. on 3/19 with severe pain at injection site. Got up to urinate and take Tylenol. While in bathroom, became dizzy, broke into sweats, and felt I was about to faint. I went to my knees holding onto counter. My wife came in to help me in bathroom. She observed I was incoherent but uttering moaning sounds and breathing heavily. She called 911. While on phone I came to and vomited into sink. It appeared I had not digested anything from dinner that night. After vomiting (1x) I felt much better.  First responders reported normal vital signs. I did not go to E.R. that night but went to Urgent Care later that morning and all seemed fine.

                                                About eight hours after the injection, I noticed some hearing impairment in my left ear.  Sounds are muffled, almost as if I have water trapped in the ear canal.  I noticed this right before I went to bed, and the hearing loss is still present and similar in magnitude this morning.  There is no pain, and the hearing in my right ear seems to be normal, although I can&#39;t rule out some slight loss on that side.  Aside from a slightly sore arm at the injection site, I&#39;ve had no other side effects (e.g., no fever) from the vaccination.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

Morning after 2nd shot became nauseated; ran fever and ached all over.  He felt this was for 2 -3 days, and also very tired.  Still very tired on 4th day after shot, but no fever or aching. Patient did take Tylenol, didn&#39;t help so also 1 dose of Ibuprofen.  Take Prasugrel, so Ibuprofen wasn&#39;t really an option for him.

                                                On Feb 16, day 26 after dose 1, at around 7:30pm I started having continuous Chills suddenly and felt my body temperature rising. I confirmed with Thermometer every 15 minutes, going from 99.1F to 101 F in  the span of 2 hours. I took 2 Tylenols (500mg each) at around 9:30pm and started drinking  over 1 liter of water, fortified with Electrolytes... My temperature gradually started to go down  by 10:30pm and back to normal 98.7 F by midnight... I was worried that I have COVID (my Dose 2 was scheduled on 2/18). I went and did a COVID PCR test which thankfully came out &#34;Negative&#34; in the evening of 2/17.  I re-established my Dose 2 appointment  for today 2/18 same facility as Dose 1.  It is worth mentioning that on 1/29, 8 days after my first dose, I developed  sudden itching and redness at the site of the vaccine injection (right arm) and my skin was hardened around the site. Also,  this reaction lasted  24 hours and as if nothing happened in next day.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, the symptoms started with a stiff neck and headache on the left side including soreness at the injection site. As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.

I was unable to sleep due to the symptoms the first night.   I convalesced the entire next day and tired easily for the next two days after that.  Here&#39;s the unusual side affect:  I had uncontrollable and very painful leg cramps, that I could not relax. I had to take a muscle relaxer.  That was the night of the second vaccine.  The cramps were abated thereafter. I am reporting them because I saw them as a side effect no where online.

                                                After receiving the first Moderna vaccination in my Left arm, I started feeling pain in the area of the vaccination site on the evening of 03/22/21. As time progressed I started to realize I was losing all motion in my arm and weakness on my entire left side of my body, but assumed this was a side-effect of the vaccination .  I was not concerned until my wife alarmed me in the morning when she looked at me and noticed the left side of my face drooped and had that I had difficulty standing, no balance, little use of my left leg and no use of my left arm and hand.  At that point, 7:00am 03/23/21, my wife drove me to the ER.  I was admitted and an inpatient for 15 days including PT/OT/ST therapies at the hospital for Stroke.

Presently (D10) muscle involvement and severity is unchanged. Muscle pain is dull ache whereas injection site pain is sharp.  No swelling or redness is noted.  No fever, chills or other signs of infection, just myalgia and questionable arthralgia of joints.

                                                Approximately 5 days after receiving 1st dose of vaccine, patient woke up from nighttime sleep feeling &#39;itchy&#39; all over body. Found approximately 10 red, raised spots or &#39;welts&#39; on skin that he had never seen before. They were sporadic, NOT clustered. He described as not quite hives. He checked bed for &#39;bugs&#39; but didn&#39;t find anything. He had taken metaxolone for only the second time in his life before bed. Prior use did not elicit any type of &#39;rash&#39; as described. He applied no topical nor ingested any oral medication at this time. He mentioned he has IBS and also had 1 instance of diarrhea. He then took 1 imodium. He was able to eventually fall back asleep. When he awoke the next morning, all but 1 spot were gone and no indication this had ever happened. He has experienced a mild headache off and off since injection, but nothing significant that keeps him from his normal business.

He had bloodwork done 48 hrs after vaccination prior to giving blood. He was told that he was &#34;positive for HIV and leukemia&#34; based on that bloodwork. He was then seen by PCP and had repeat labs which were normal. He denies any further symptoms. The PCP attributed the false positive lab results to having the COVID vaccine 48 hrs prior to initial labwork.

The rash has continued after 4 weeks and is still affecting patient. Physician has given triamcinolone acetonide, decadron injection, and oral prednisone but none have helped. The only thing that seems to relieve the itching temporarily is OTC antibacterial hand sanitizer with isopropyl alcohol.

                                                Pre-existing condition of kidney failure; Pre-existing conditions of heart failure; Skin rash; A spontaneous report  was received from a 63-year-old male, consumer who received Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced pre-existing conditions of heart failure / cardiac failure and kidney failure / renal failure.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included preexisting conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. No relevant concomitants were reported.   On unk Feb 2021 (during the first week of February), prior to onset of symptoms, the patient received their first dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 026L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for the prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   On unknown date, the patient experienced a rash, but no other reaction. He reported taking no other medication when he had  received his first dose.   On 17 Feb 2021, the patient was hospitalized for his pre-existing conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. He was discharged on 21 Feb 2021. No treatment information was provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, rash, pre-existing heart failure and kidney failure red, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality the serious events kidney failure and heart failure are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 but possibly related to the consumer&#39;s pre-existing conditions of renal failure and cardiac failure, while the non-serious event of rash may be possibly related to mRNA-1273.

Nausea and slight headache during the  night at about 3:00 AM that went away in a couple of hours. Arm pain persisted the next day. The following day the pain also involved the armpit, possibly lymph glands. Lesser pain at the injection site and arm pit areas the following day and was very slight the third day after the injection. Can?t wait for my second dose and despite the side affects will happily stand in line for my next dose.

But approximately one week later I developed rashes on the back on my neck and both wrists. They aren&#39;t conspicuous, but they do itch. I&#39;ve had them for about two - three days. The rashes are slowly subsiding.

After 5PM mainly 101 fever, tired, muscle aches, headcahes, chills, hair follicles hurting ( had this when I had COVID-19 mid-March 2020); My symptoms from the 1st shot brought back memories of how the COVID-19 virus felt, except I did not have the congestion and sinus issues.  Fever broke at 3AM morning of March 13, woke up soaking wet, entire body and hair drenched as if I stepped out of the shower, did not dry off and got into bed. Felt fatigued Day 3 but feeling a lot better, able to be more active. Today is March 19, 8 days since shot #1 and my arm at the Vaccine site is still a bit sore, redness has subsided however.  Worried post shot 2 may be worse.

                                                After the first day I developed soreness at the injection site.  After about 2 days, the soreness moved to my left shoulder joint.  Currently, 8 days after the injection, my left shoulder joint remains sore and any motion to left my left arm laterally from my side is painful; like my joint is inflamed.  There is no redness or other visible external signs or discoloration.  I can not say for certain it is linked to the Modern vaccine as I&#39;ve had left shoulder issues infrequently in the past.  But timing wise, my current discomfort started shortly after receiving the vaccine.

Felt run down with alternating chill and sweating for next 3 days then subsided but chills and fatigue remained for addiotnal 2 days.  On Day 8 felt mostly back to normal.   I almost never get sick.  I get Flu shots every year.  I am very active and in excellent condition for my age. My wife says I have a very strong immune system and was worried this would happen.    I suspect I may have been exposed to Covid earlier this year and that is why the delayed  strong reaction.   My wife does not want me to get the second shot.

The itching made sleep very difficult for the next two nights.  The itching was decreased somewhat by the use of 1% hydrocortisone cream and moreso by 10 mg of Loratidine. The severity of the urticaria has decreased somewhat over the last 3 days since onset but is definitely still present.

He does have eczema in the cold winter months which we treat with over the counter lotions. At first, he thought the rash was due to the lotion we used because it started shortly after application of the lotion. (However, he has never had a reaction to lotions before over many years of using different brands and formulas). His skin was burning and itching throughout the day. By the time he returned from work, he had raised bumps over his back, upper arms, legs, buttocks, chest and forehead. He found some relief after a shower and use of an anti-flammatory cream (although his skin was still covered in the rash). By the time he woke next morning, it was gone.

                                                36 hours following the vaccine I was having a bad headache, moderate to severe pain at injection site, and severe diarrhea.  The diarrhea lasted about 12 hours.  I also felt general discomfort over entire body as if I had flu.  This discomfort lasted for approximately 2 to 3 days.  I was unable to perform normal activities during this time.

He has a chronic condition that give him a rash, and tried using the soap he uses when he has a flair, but it did not work, so he saw his dermatologist. He was told that it wasn&#39;t due to his condition, but was vascular in nature. On 2/10 he was prescribed a steroid cream, and told to take Zyrtec. He will follow up to let me know if this helps.

After showering it was all gone and has not returned. The evening after the vaccine, I started to experience a little pain in the left arm, especially the shoulder joint area. It did not prevent me from sleeping but did wake me when I rolled onto my left side. The pain was more severe the next morning but started to decrease after lunch. At 8 pm the day after it is just a dull ache now.

                                                A volunteer (vaccinator) who was being trained by a nurse injected the vaccine very high in the shoulder - approximately  1 inch below the acromion process. Pain in the area of the injection site and shoulder began 3 hours after the injection. Pain was exacerbated by active motion of the arm, especially abduction. The pain resolved over 48- 60 hours. There were no other symptoms from the vaccination- there was  no fever, fatigue, nausea, chills, adenopathy, etc. The concern is that the injection was clearly not in the proper location and I have questions about the efficacy of the 2nd dose that was administered and the efficacy of the overall vaccination series because of this. I contacted the Health Department and reported this. They instructed me to also submit it to Vaers.

I began to feel like I was getting sick about 10:00 pm. I went to bed then, and woke up at 02:00 am, feeling like I had the flu -- body aches &amp; feverish. Not horrible, but enough that I didn&#39;t feel like moving. I got up to go to the bathroom, and was uncovered, and then I got chilled. I went back to bed, and now at 07:30 am, I don&#39;t feel much better. My temperature is 100.6. It&#39;a normally 96 to 97.

                                                I left the vaccination feeling nothing at all. I awoke the next morning with a moderate pain/discomfort in my left upper arm at the vaccination site. I went to work because I felt okay.  I have five years of recovery.  As a result every 8-12 moths I undergo an episode of about three days where my brain forgets how to sleep properly.  So the morning after my injection, I was on my second day of irregular sleep. Around 10 am, the side effects started kicking in.  I had a slight to moderate pain above my ear on the right side of my head.  I probably had a slight fever as I felt warm and sweaty for about four hours.  I felt slight to moderate chills during the height of my discomfort for about four hours.  I could hardly walk the five blocks to my girlfriend&#39;s home because I was very conscious of my breathing.  (I have been a heavy cigarette smoker for 4o years and an developing a heightened awareness of my breathing and pulse as I feel that I am overdue for a stroke or heart attack after 40 years of heavy smoking.)  Therefore his side effect was largely hypochondriacal.  I took off work yesterday even though the side effects had subsided. Today, I feel great. I feel so great that I laughed at the entry below - &#34;Patient Died&#34;.

                                                I experienced body aches and major fatigue right after receiving the vaccine on 03-04-21.  It was worse on the second day.  On the third day my right hip area and right leg was very sore and tender to the touch and noticed a rash on my hip area.  The rash spread all over my right leg and foot and the pain got worse.  My toes and foot became numb.  I took Tylenol and Aleve to relieve the pain for a few days however I did not improve for a week.  I visited an emergency care on 03-13-21 and was diagnosed with Shingles and I was prescribed Famiclovir.  I started taking  the meds as of yesterday and I am still experiencing pain all over my leg and numb foot.

Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b.

The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).

I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen.

Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

Area was warm to the touch but no itching.  Area was quite large in circumference (approximately 3 inches long by 3 inches wide).  Have heard this reported in the media as &#34;Covid arm&#34;.   Area is less red as of 3/17/21 but is still noticeable.

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

Patient denies swelling, difficulty breathing, or signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis. Patient took an antihistamine (does not remember which one, but not Benadryl), and the condition began to improve, yet not fully resolved as of 4 days after vaccination. Patient was instructed to inform primary care physician of reaction and to sign up for the V-Safe program to report the reaction to the CDC as well.

                                                8 days after receiving Moderna shot  # 1(received on 03/22/2021), a 1 1/2&#43;/- inch round raised red bump itchy rash developed at the injection site. It remains the same as of 9:00PM EST this evening, although the itch has subsided. It remains warm to touch with little bumps in the raised area. No fever. The day before this reaction, I had my annual physical with no issues at the time. Prior to this reaction, 30 minutes after receiving the injection on 03/22/2021, I experienced a sudden red flush to my cheeks that lasted for only 15 minutes.  No swelling of face, neck, throat. No elevation in heart rate noted.  The evening following the day of injection, I had a 99.4 degree fever for about an hour, then fine. No fever since. No other reactions.

Red splotches at first, then swelling and quite itchy. No other symptoms or difficulty breathing. Received 2nd vaccination on 02/15/2021 in Right arm.  The &#34;rash&#34; has spread to upper chest, back and a bit on both legs, front and back. My self-treatment has been: Hydrocortisone (anti-itch)-topical cream on itch areas. Also taking 50mg/day of: Diphenhydramine. It remains quite persistent, but seems to be slowly dissapating? It&#39;s now 17 days since second injection.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine on Monday 1/11/21. There was swelling and pain at the injection site which lasted about 4 days. There was NO redness or rash at the injection site for a week. On 1/18/21 in the evening, suddenly a rash appeared which was warmer than the surrounding area. It was tender and about the size of a half dollar. It rapidly grew in size, on 1/20/21 it is now about 3x3.5 inches across and is still growing. I have called the Public Health Dept where I got the vaccination, without getting a response (3 times). I called Moderna, and was given a case Number: MOD21-09316. Batch number was 025J20-2A. They were not able to tell me anything beyond what I could read online. (It is odd that my injection site reaction was delayed a week.) I emailed my doctor and attached a photo. I am waiting to hear back.

                                                Two days after the injection of the Moderna I saw a small irritated area on both my ankles.  It appeared about sock high and I imagined it was just a rub and maybe I tightened my boots a bit too much.  The next day it was a nasty looking dark red rash that looked like it had broken the skin but had not.  It didn&#39;t itch, there was no pain and it darkened after my shower, so I scheduled a clinic visit.  It was worse the next day and migrating upwards.  The migrated red was more like dots, small and moved up the sides of my legs to my hips and shoulders, both sides evenly, but not nearly as bad as the original outbreak at my ankles which worsened.  I saw dr.  and he suggested Benadry, took pictures and conferred with a collegue.  I bought Benadryl, took one tablet.  That night I took two Tylenol PM.  In the morning the rash was still spreading upward, but was less dark and still no pain or itchiness.  I took 3 Benadryl throughout the day, and one Tylenol PM that night.  The rash began to fade and didn&#39;t redden as bad in the shower.  It faded more each day, but it was evident on my shoulders and hips, still nothing compared to the ankles.  I got a call from Dr. that I should not get the second Moderna Covid 19 shot and wait and possibly get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine when it&#39;s available.  I asked him what I could expect if I ignored his advice and did it anyways. ....He said, &#34;I think I need to talk to your wife&#34;.. So there you go.

I went to Pharmacy after a week went by and the nurse there told me the shot was given too high as she could see where it was given by the bruise on my arm. She gave me Ibuprofen 800 and said if it did not get any better to get an image of it and gave me a place to go. When I receive the shot the girl had said its bleeding and asked if I was on blood thinners (I am not). She was real nervous and said she must have hit the muscle which at the time I was thinking that was were it supposed to go. I don&#39;t think she was sure of what she was doing.

No signs or symptoms at the actual injection site.  No other systemic signs or symptoms after some malaise on the day following the injection. This shoulder was asymptomatic before the vaccination and is the shoulder for the non-dominant hand. The self-reporting patient is an orthopedic surgeon.

Went to bed at 8:00 due to fatigue.  Felt nauseated.   Was hurting really bad with the joint pain that lasted until about 2:30 AM.   He woke up this morning and is feeling much better.   He did not take anything for the pain.  It attacked his joints mainly his ankles and knees and was not able to move.  His knees felt hot to the touch.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

                                                1) Tinnitus - The principal adverse event was a significant increase in my tinnitus, to levels I hadn&#39;t experienced since I originally developed the condition following a viral infection in May 2006. I first noticed mild tinnitus the day after the injection and it gradually became worse over two weeks. [not recovered] 2) Sore arm - I had a hard time lifting my arm the evening of the injection. I recovered in a day. [recovered] 3) &#34;COVID arm&#34; - My right arm became red swollen and itchy for about three days, starting a week after the injection. [recovered]

Then,  five or six days after the injection, I began experiencing chills.  They progressed to violent shivering by Feb. 16.  On that day, I had a fever of 102.  The next day, the fever topped out at 103.  Today, my temperature has been dropping.  I  also have been experiencing itching all over my body.

I felt that I was extremely ill for the first 45 hours.  I ate very little and I could not bathe.  I stayed in bed, leaving only to go to the restroom.  On the 3rd day, I was much improved and I would characterize my symptoms as moderate.  I was able to get up for short periods and I was also able to bathe.  On the 4th day (today) I believe that I am symptom free with the exception of continued arm soreness at the injection sight.

Was fairly itchy.  Felt like ripples across my back.  On 2/23/2021 itchiness seemed to start to decrease.  Red rash and itchiness is mostly gone by 3/3/2021.  Throughout event I applied dry skin lotion, Shikai Borage Therapy, which seemed to reduce itchiness a bit.  Consulted primary physician 2/23/2021 who advised Benadryl but I did not use it.

                                                Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity.   I developed a red, raised, itchy skin reaction over the vaccine injection site one week after receiving the Moderna COVID -19 vaccination.  My upper left arm was puffy and tender.   The itching is eased with topical hydrocortisone.  I am only one day into this, but it is so far a minor issue.  I spoke with my primary care physician and they suggested ice and Benedryl if the symptoms persisted and said the issue may last a week or so.

                                                I had sharp pain in my left wrist that went into my hand and up my left arm into the shoulder.  After a few day, I contacted my doctor, but it was subsiding by the time I saw him.  In about a week, it flared up again so I made an appointment with a hand specialist.  He believes I have a carpel tunnel issue.  The pain went away on its own after another week or so.  It returned again after my second dose of the vaccine, as well as other side effects that I will report for the second dose.  I also had some pain at the injection site that lasted for only a few days.

                                                I developed what I believe was a Morbilliform rash over my entire body, including torso, back, neck, arms and legs.  It began the second day after I was vaccinated and took about 5 days to fully resolve.  Benadryl was not effective in treating the rash, but hydrocortizone cream did alleviate the itching.  After my first COVID19 vaccine I had a circular rash at the site of the injection.

                                                About 6 hours after vaccination I experienced soreness at the site of the injection (scale of 4-5).  Overnight the pain got worse (scale 6 or more).  The pain at the site was more than I have experienced with a tetanus shot.  It was uncomfortable to sleep or rollover.  The pain was more than I have had with any previous injection.  The next morning which is today, I examined the site of the injection and saw that the injection site was at the top of the deltoid muscle approaching the bursar.  I am not a large individual at 5&#39; 8&#34; and 140 pounds.  My deltoid is not very large and the injection was above the thickest part of the deltoid.  I am a pharmacist and give injections, I also had my wife look at it, she is also a injection administering pharmacist.  We both determined the injection site was outside the normal injection location of the deltoid.  It is now over 24 hours since the injection, and the pain/discomfort is subsiding.  At this point the pain is similar to a tetanus shot and acceptable (scale 2-3).

                                                Pt received 1st dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 01/04/2021 in L deltoid. Came back to clinic at 0800 on 01/06/2021 c/o excruciating pain in entire L arm radiating to neck, chest, and around his upper and lower back. States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

                                                Within 24 hours, I began experiencing bouts of severe pruritis starting in the lower extremities. Rash developed in areas of excoriation due to severe itching, pinpoint red macules.  The episodes of pruritis were not responsive to Benadryl Zyrtec or Claritin. For two nights I took Vistaril with mild relief. Medrol dose pack was ineffective. Over the next week the episodes increased in intensity and frequency and were often accompanied by localized redness and superficial swelling of the skin and hive like raised areas of the skin as in urticaria. The areas of localized pruritis migrated  over a period  lasting  7 to 10 days,  first to inner surfaces of both my arms, then to my lower back, and then to my upper back over scapulae and shoulders. Concurrently, the pruritis and rash began resolving in the lower extremities and then on the inner aspect of my upper extremities. Currently,  the intensity and frequency of the pruritis has decreased significantly  and is now localized to my upper back.   Yesterday was the first day that I did not require antihistamines.

                                                Developed a itchy, mildly painful rash around the injection site a full week after the vaccination.  The area was also swollen and warm to the touch.   At the recommendation of my doctor responded by applying ice to the area twice a day, applying cortisone cream 3 or 4 times a day and taking Benadryl at bedtime.   It is 90% better at the time of this report approximately 4 days after the first symptoms.

                                                3 or 4 days after receiving the first Covid Vaccine I developed a rash/hives on my torso as well as constant chills. My Dermatologist biopsied the rash (awaiting results) and treating with Allegra and Benadryl. After 3 days of the symptoms seem to be slowing getting better. My question is: Are hives &amp; chills a reaction to the vaccine? And if so, should I get my 2nd vaccine that is scheduled for 2/17/21?

                                                Severe chills the night of the shot, teeth chattering, couldn&#39;t get warm;  next afternoon, chills resumed mid afternoon.  Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

                                                Seven days after receiving my first Moderna shot for Covid-19, I developed a large pink colored oval rash around the injection site on my left arm.  The rash also itched.   Doing some online research I believe I developed a case of &#34;Covid-Arm&#34;.   I am treating the rash with a cortisone cream.   I have had the rash now for two days.  It is not getting worse but is still very prevalent.   My initial side effects from the injection consisted of a sore arm for two days and a mild, dull headache that responded to one dose of Tylenol.  Otherwise I had no initial side effects from the first dose.

The site where the injection was given had bruised and is now fading and is a yellowish color.  Directly below the injection site and its bruised area is a hot feeling, itchy red rash.  Through the course of the day, the red rash has increased in size, approximately 3.5 inch in diameter.  The same day around 5:30 PM I begin to feel a pain/ache in right shoulder and up into my neck on the right side.  The pain level gains and the level of pain reaches 5 in about two hours.  The aching seems deep beneath the shoulder bone and into the spine of the neck.  The rash and pain remain to present, 2/28/2021 Sunday.  The rash maintained the same side and began to slowly disappear yesterday, 2/27/2021 Sunday late evening.  The pain was at it&#39;s worst with arm and shoulder movement but was worse, even without movement of the arm and shoulder between 2/26/2021 Friday and 2/27/2021 Saturday, even when in bed, interrupting my sleep.  On 2/27/2021 Saturday evening the red rash had noticeable fading and the pain level began to decrease.   Today 2/28/2021 the red rash is almost goin and the neck and shoulder pain is no worse than level 1.

                                                Extreme pain in the left shoulder and arm at the injection site. Unable to lift arm past height of shoulder or head without further pain. Pushing with the left hand on an object creates pain in the arm and shoulder. Resting on the elbow will also create the same pain. The pain is constant. At night I usually wake up between 1 and 3 am from the throbbing pain. According to the physician, the pain seems to mimic a rotator cuff injury, which I do not have, nor have I had. I have been taking Motrin 2 to 3x per day, and Extra Strength Tylenol during those 1 to 3 am morning wake-ups. Putting the left arm thru a shirt is a painful task. Outside of arm at injection to the touch creates pain.

Then on the 6th day post injection, my upper arm started feel hot and taught, hard to the touch and itched.  Not really pain in the muscle but more of a large red skin irritation has increased in symptoms all day.  I have read there is a slight chance of Cutaneous Hypersensitivity, and presume that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, but thought I should report it.  I have not seen a Dr. at this point.  Will try Benadryl or hydrocortisone cream in the morning if not improving.

During February, I was experiencing high work stress (writing software).  When I am stressed, I scratch spots of keratosis on my arms.  During February, this behavior remarkably resulted in small lesions blossoming into circular lesions the size of a quarter.  These lesions were many (about 6 on left arm alone), large, wet and open sores, painful, and would not heal.  At one point, I had 6 sores on my left arm, several on my right, a painful sore on my right buttocks, two painful sores behind my ear, a sore at the base of my neck in back, and a very painful sore on my scrotum, plus a huge blood blister on my lower lips.  As I was enduring all of this, I also had severe sores within my nose that bled profusely.  All of this was very painful and very unusual.  Nothing like this had ever happened before to me.  I treated the worst of these sores with Neosporin and bandages.  They have improved, but not healed entirely yet.   All of this was initiated by my stress and scratching behavior.  But I am convinced that the extreme results must be due to the vaccines, which seem to have interfered with the healing, made the sores get very large and infected, and kept my blood from clotting.  There has been significant improvement, but I have not yet recovered from this.

Then 6 days later had itching bumps/hives that turn red, and just erupts on his hips, groin, arms in places, abdomen, most parts of his body including his scalp and has persisted.   He had it for 4 days and she began giving him Benadryl, which has helped.   He still has these areas and reaction.  He has been having headaches since he&#39;s had these reactions.    In Jan/Feb he was having some symptoms, COVID toe, hives, blood shot eye and intestinal problems all at the same time, which they believe he had the COVID virus due to articles that they had read about.  He went to a podiatrist who did not know what he was looking at.  These reactions are similar to the reaction he had when he believes he had the COVID virus.  They live in a ski resort area and they have people coming from all over, and had a lot of friends who had &#34;the flu&#34;.    He tried to call his doctor twice to get some advice, and was never able to speak to her and the nurses misunderstood what he was calling for.

                                                My left arm is in excruciating pain I cannot use nor could I sleep first night. Arm is almost dead in some ways. I cannot life past my mouth as cannot even extend very well.  Severe pain, aching also pain down shoulder into right hand. I have tried icing, heat, applied Cold spray. It is slightly painful 2 days later but still lots of pain. I cannot use arm to do chores. Even brushing teeth was hard. Arm was fine till 10 hours later then became worse and worse. Plus have little strength in arm. I cannot use arm to dry myself after shower.  Arm continues to be painful, aspirin does nothing to alleviate pain.  I regret getting vaccine and have doubts to complete series as I heard second shot worse.  I have not sought treatment yet but may go see my PCP this week.

                                                Patient complains of widespread rash over most of body but most notably on his arms. This rash is itchy and skin appears red, dry, and flaky. Upon speaking to a nurse in our infusion center, she believes this is a longstanding issue; however, the patient reports this has either appeared or worsened in the last 3 weeks since his second Moderna COVID19 vaccine. Patient took diphenhydramine but did not like the side effects so a provider recommended daily Claritin to start.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

On 3/27/21, he got a fever that ranged between 99.7 to 102.6.  He could not eat and thinking about it made his stomach upset.  Every bone and joint in his body ached, even his skin hurt and he had a bad headache.  Tylenol did little to alleviate any of these symptoms.  His fever  broke on 3/27/21 about 11 pm.  He still did not sleep well and slept until noon on 3/28/21.  His symptoms persisted except for the fever, though he still had chills that night.  He still did not feel well throughout 3/29/21 and 3/30/21 and he still ate very, very little until 3/31/21.  On 3/31/21, he was able to eat and went to the grocery, but it wiped him out and he slept for a couple of hours in the afternoon.

                                                He got his vaccine, within 24 hours later he had hives, his lips and face swelled up, he had a low grade temp of 99.8 having chills and wanting to stay warm and lay in bed with multiple  blankets.  After his daughter noticed it about 2 hours later they went to the ER, and they gave him a steroid, Benadryl and a steroid and gave him IV Pepcid until the swelling went down and he felt better.   They gave him 6 days worth of Benadryl, and steroids which he did take for that.  After 6 days and after 24 hours he broke again in the same manner and they told him that it was okay as long as he was breathing well.  He then went to the UC and he bought OTC Benadryl which he continued.  Then exactly 30 days after he went to the ER on 4/24/21 he broke again with the lips swelling, hives, temperature was normal but feeling achy and the same symptoms he had from the beginning.  He went to his PCP and he has him now on steroids, Benadryl and the Pepcid when needed as well.  He takes the Benadryl as needed and then the symptoms subside and the reaction comes back.   If he does not do the Benadryl until later this evening then his lips will start tightening and then swell.

                                                Injection was given very close to the shoulder joint in my left arm, as a result within a few hours a very sharp pain in my shoulder caused me to be unable to lift my left arm without extreme pain, not muscle pain. By 4:00 pm I was sapped of energy. During the night I developed chills and ran a fever of 100.4 F. By Sunday morning I felt nauseous, but did not vomit. At 2:00pm 12/10/2020 my fever has lowered and the nausea has subsided, but the shoulder joint is still very sore.

                                                Itching and rash noticed on Jan 22.  By Jan 24 itching had subsided. Mild rash remains.  Rash centered around the site of the injection on the right deltoid.  Rash diameter approximately 3 inches.  No pain noted past the initial 2-3 days post injection.  Initial post injection pain was mild as would be expected and not thought to be at all unusual.  At the time of this report filing the rash persists but to a lessor extent and is considered mild.

Discomfort lasted 3 -4 days  About 7 days after injection a very itchy rash developed on my left arm, chest, and right arm. The rash are small, prickly red spots that cover most of the area on my arms and upper chest.  It is so itchy that I broke the skin while scratching in my sleep. I googled the condition and find that my symptoms do not match most others as it is not localized at the injection site.

The first shot I had a bad rash 14 days after receiving the vaccine.  This was treated with Benadryl and hydrocortisone and within two weeks, it was almost gone. Therefore, I was advised by my doctor to get the 2nd shot in the other arm.  Within 24 hours of the second shot, the same rash broke out from shoulder to elbow that happened after the first shot. In addition, at the same time, my right armpit gland became very swollen and sensitive to the touch.  Doctor advised to again use Benadryl for 48 hours and hyrdocortisone.

The area is reddish, a little swollen and warm to the touch.  The shot was given to the right arm.     The same type of rash appeared at the site of injection a week after the 1st vaccine dose.  (Moderna Lot 029L20A) It took about 6 days for the rash to disappear after the first vaccine dose.  The first vaccine was also given in the right  arm.

It was itchy but not painful to the touch, treated it with topical spray. Today is 2nd day, &#34;rash&#34; grew  from 2&#34; to 3&#34; around, still itchy but not painful.  I was concerned until I read a helpful article at website which said to report it to you, assist you with research. The article says it goes away in 3-7 days, so I will mark &#34;No&#34; under &#34;is patient recovered&#34; below, as it has not yet.

                                                Since I received the shot at the end of January my arm has been sore at the injection site. It was very sore for the first 4-5 days after receiving the shot. The pain was continuously subsiding over the next weeks, but for the last 5 days there has been no change. It feels as if the pain has now stabilized. My arm is not debilitated, but the upper arm is sore and the pain is noticeable. Will I have to live with this pain for the rest of my life? I am supposed to get the 2nd shot tomorrow and I am very worried. Should I get the 2nd shot or no? If I decide to get the 2nd shot, I will have to do it in my other arm. Then, will I have 2 sore arms for the rest of my life? I have not done anything concerning treatment, since the soreness has to wear off on its own. There is no magic bullet. The question is, Will the soreness ever completely disappear? It has been a month now, and I have never had this kind of long-term soreness to any injection or vaccine before.

About 11 hours after injection (9:00 pm) there were chills/shivers for about 6 hours. Temperature was 97.6. General fatigue and malaise the next day. Again at 9:00 pm there was less severe chills/shivers for about 2 hours. No other effects after that. Minor soreness at the injection site.  Perhaps minor reaction but I thought it would be beneficial to report.

                                                One week post injection, on February 18, I developed  chills and a fever starting around 9 PM. I experienced diarrhea starting around 10 PM. Fever was approx 100.4 F and was accompanied by a splitting headache and significant body aches, to the point where I was unable to get any sleep that night. I noticed Covid arm the next morning. Fever, headache and body aches continued until Monday morning. I took only Extra Strength Tylenol. Most of the time Tylenol was effective only for the first 2-3 hrs before the discomfort overcame it. I was tested twice for COVID, both Friday AM and Monday AM. Both came back negative. Starting Monday the body aches and fever began to subside but I was left with a feeling of exhaustion and required continuous sleep.  Today is the first day I feel back to normal. I still have a large Covid arm rash, two weeks post injection. It causes no discomfort whatsoever.

Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

                                                The day after my second dose ( February 18th) I felt sore at injection site and slight headache/neck ache and fatigue. next day (February 20th) I noticed a tightness in chest and started checking pulse and ECG on my apple watch. Results came back as showing signs of AFib. Never saw this before. I have checked the ECG app on the watch  on and off since getting it in December. Every time  before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine the results came back as normal Sinus rhythm. Since February 18th my ECG on the apple watch has indicated Afib, going on 11 days now.

Per wife - patient became clammy, very warm, unresponsive, gurgling at the mouth. I ran out to check on patient Pharm.D.  They asked if they could remove his mask , i told them YES! he had a cloth mask over an n95 mask! Upon inspection, patient was not talking to me like he was prior to vaccine. They said patient gets tired and can become out of it, so they were not sure if this was a rxn to vaccine or just one of his episodes.  Patient has prior hx of 3 times stroke and is on dialysis. He did not appear to be in anaphylaxis and was breathing (when looking at chest). We called code white to pharmacy, and  Manager called EMS 5:44pm. Pharm.D came out to assist me 5:45pm. It was difficult to get a pulse using fingers, so we used BP cuff and got 83/57, with 87 BPM 547pm. I had epi pen ready to go in case we needed to use it but wanted to wait since patient was still breathing. While waiting for EMS, patient became responsive and began to talk. EMS showed up and took over. At this time Patient was talking and joking. 550 pm We decided we wanted patient to be checked out prior to sending him on his way. EMS asked us what we had done, and we discussed the above. EMS took over from there 555pm. Everything turned out ok, EMS left without further intervention. Before they left, I went to speak to family, and they were very happy due to the care they received. Event ending @ 6:15pm

I routinely get hives but this was different.  Normally one dose of hive medicine 5mg will stop the itching  instead I had to take a double dose and then another double dose four hours later.  The next day I was still having itching issues and had to repeat the same large soes of hive medicine.  Brought it under control.  Felt bad for an additional two days .

                                                Rash around injection site, with extreme itching and slight bumps like tiny insect bites. Rash was 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Researched it immediately and found info saying this delayed reaction had already been seen in a small percentage of patients. Source suggested ice and topical antihistamine, so I applied a bit of Benadryl liquid (for bug bites) to decrease the intense itching.

Yesterday, 3/11/21 the injection site area went to itching, and then he noticed a pretty good swelling in that area, and now the swelling is fairly deep, 3/4&#34; high and about 3&#34; across, about as big as 1/2 the size around as a baseball and sticks up about an inch.  It&#39;s red to touch.  His son is a nurse and told him some remedies for the symptoms.   He has taken some ibuprofen for it as well, which did not do anything for the swelling.

                                                When I got home around 5:30pm on Saturday I had a 5 minute coughing fit (dry cough) which seemed to come out of nowhere.  I was fine for the rest of the evening and when I woke up Sunday morning my arm was sore (from the shot) but I had no other side affects other than coughing occasionally.  I noticed my throat was raw.  I ran 3 miles, did my stretches and carried out my day without any apparent side effects.  I slept poorly but that is not that unusual, doing a full exercise routine Monday morning.  Other than the cough and raw throat, I seemed fine until the late afternoon (48 hour after the vaccination) when I started to ache all over--including a mild headache (which I rarely get) with the cough continuing and my throat raw.  I went to be early last night in the hopes that it would be over by morning, but it wasn&#39;t.  I still ache all over, including the headache, am still coughing a bit, my throat is still raw, and I feel completely dragged out.

                                                Started getting ringing in my ears about 5 or 6 days after getting my second injection of the Moderna vaccine on March 7th. I received the first injection on February 7th. I didn&#39;t notice any side effects  from the first shot other than minor soreness in the injection site of my left arm. I had minor soreness with the second shot as well but it was less than the first. I did take two 400 mg Anacin plus caffeine (32mg) 3 days before my second shot for a sinus headache I  had at the time. I am going to see my ear, nose and throat doctor this Friday 3/26 to have him check me out and maybe get a hearing test if he thinks it&#39;s necessary.

Then had a mild headache that evening. Then nothing else noticeable the next day I did feel some chills and still tired so I slept . But the different reaction I had started either late in the evening of the day after shot or early morning of the 2nd day after shot. I noticed the top of my left forearm, (the same arm in which I received the shot) started itching a bit and when I looked in the morning I had some minor red blotches like one gets from a rub against poison ivy. The itching stopped in about 3 more days the redness in about 6. No additional issues arose. Everything back to normal. Just thought I&#39;d share in case others notice same reaction which in the end was inconsequential.

Impossible to sleep despite Tylenol to try to relieve the pain.  By morning, 30 March, the pain subsided to a 1 on the same scale, but my arm swelled up from my bicep all the way to my hand and today, 4 1/2 days later, it is still swollen.  My primary care doctor is sending me for a sonogram on Monday or Tuesday to discern if there is any underlying damage.

                                                First some pain in left arm at injection site...... after a few hours my all m y joints started to hurt really bad. Especially my left knee backside and my right ankle. Both had been injured in the past. the pain was so bad that I was limping while walking. that lasted for three days then the intensity of the pain abated still noticeable in all the joint till about 1.5 weeks after the injection. Still now almost 4 weeks after injection I still feel the injection site in my left arm. A noticeable light pain and itching.

I started having chills. I have a fever, still with aches and pains. The soreness at the injection site is about gone. Yesterday, 01.03.21, I was running a fever between 99-101 all night long. Last night I took one Tylenol to help slow it down a little. It&#39;s been pretty severe up until now. Right now my temp is 98.1.  I did not go to the ER and my wife has the lot number in her purse with her right now.

It peaked about a week ago - bumps, some with red dots, splotchy and is better now.  I thought it was dry skin or heat rash, itched a little from time to time.  I started applying Ceravae about a week to 10 days ago and it seemed to help. I haven&#39;t had any diet changes, no changes in laundry soap or been anywhere around poison ivy, oak of sumac.  The only change we can think of preceding there rash  during this period was the COVID vaccine.

Around 10:00 pm I started to feel soreness running up my arm to my shoulder and down to my forearm from the injection site. All night, the pain kept getting worse. By 3:00 am the pain reached a level 8 with any movement jumping to an intolerable level 10, the worst pain I&#39;ve ever experienced from any vaccination I&#39;ve ever have taken. Needless to say, I was in pain all night. I have no other symptoms at this time. Should I be concerned?

HCP approached vehicle where a 68yo white male was sitting in his vehicle on the driver side. Quick assessment revealed erythema of the face and angioedema. Pt was able to speak clearly, was CTA and had RRR. 911 was called. BP 160/90.  EpiPen dose 1 was injected into right vastus lateralis and pt reported improvement at 1057.  HCP asked for injectable diphenhydramine. HCP continued to monitor pt with RRR and CTA but erythema and angioedema began again along with swollen tongue so EpiPen dose 2 was injected into right vastus lateralis. 50mg IM diphenhydramine was injected into the right deltoid while fire rescue began to arrive on scene. Pt did not report difficulty breathing. Pt did report previous anaphylaxis to fire ant bites/stings and did report being allergic to bee stings. Fire rescue transported patient without difficulty. HCP called pt later that night at 2030 who reported doing better but still having tongue swelling.

On 2-15-2021 I developed a rash very similar to Hives over approximately 10% of my upper torso between my waist and neck.  Was very itchy so I applied an itch stopping cream which eliminated most of the itching.  By the next morning some much reduced rash remained but virtually no itching.  As I write this at 9 PM 2-16-2021 the rash is still evident.

The client reports that he feels they are improving and he is not going  to see his medical provider at this time.

Chills and general body/joint aches started approx 26-30 hrs post injection.  Fever (101.2F) peaked ~ 36 hrs after 1st injection.  Mild but obvious headache ceased after 48 hrs.  No injection site rash, just soreness of the arm (like all of my previous flu vaccinations).   Second vaccination was followed with chills and peak fever of 101.4F along same time interval.  Current 02/25/21 at 2:30 pm pacific fever has ?broke? with some sweating.  Feeling much better.  I know these symptoms are positive evidence that body is geared up building the protection system for which we are vaccinated. Self-medicated with acetaminophen (500 mg) to relieve aches. Thank you!!

I quickly took Benadryl and a few hours later it started to get back to normal. It did not hurt or anything but slowly got back to normal. The next day 02/112/2021 I was itching on the right side of my stomach and had a big red bump. I kept taking Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for the next 7 days because otherwise as soon as i stopped taking the medicine I would have itching and bumps in my arms and side of my stomach. I had my lips swollen, my right eye lid droop. I still have episodes of itching and bumps  16 days after vaccine

                                                Approximately 10 days after receiving my first Moderna covid vaccine, I began developing a very bad  case of hives over most parts of my body.  The doctor has diagnosed it as chronic idiopathic uticaria (no known cause). The hives have been extremely itchy and have even woken me at night.  I have been on the following medicines to try and curb the relentless symptoms -- hydroxine, clarinex, xyzal, and prednisone.  There has been no let up or decreasing of symptoms since they started.  My dermatologist who is treating me has also seen this in one or two of her other patients and thinks the delayed response could be related to the vaccine.

                                                More than normal pain was experiences as the vaccine was being administered. About four hours after injection, extreme pain in left shoulder, rotator cuff, unable to move arm .  Had to take ibuprofen approximately every six hours for the next 24 hours.  Two days since the injection, the pain is about 20 percent less.  NOTE 1: The probable reason for the unusual pain was that the injection was given much too high on the arm, near the top of the shoulder. I went back to the pharmacy on March 6, 2021, spoke with senior pharmacist, and showed the injection location with the band-aid still on. He noted it was a &#34;bit high&#34; and who had administered the vaccine. He said he would look into the injection technique of the person who had administered the dose.  NOTE 2 - THIS IS THE REASON I SUBMIT THIS REPORT: While the situation is handled at the pharmacy in question, I believe that with the rush to get the vaccine into arms, the CDC may need to pay more attention to the experience level of those administering it, making sure they have the proper training and actually have learned the proper injection technique. The CDC&#39;s YouTube video I have seen on the injection technique is a bit long.  The segment beginning at the 2:40 minute point should be separated and labeled &#34;injection technique for adults&#34; and have it made clearer that the injection is at the CENTER of the deltoid, with the very top of the inverted triangle NOT being acceptable.  My understanding is that the pain level from injecting at the rotator cuff is unnecessary and can lead to SIRVA - &#34;Shoulder Injury from Vaccine.&#34; Please take the necessary steps to ensure the vaccine is being properly administered at the correct place in the arm. Otherwise, too many people will be undergoing unnecessary,  extreme pain as I have .

This area became very soar and I am unable to walk on that part of my foot without  extreme pain and swelling. I have not seen a physician yet, but doctor ordered an x-ray which he said showed no fracture. I am waiting to see a podiatrist . My foot has shown no signs of improvement so far.

                                                He received the vaccine, hours after the vaccine about 3-4 in the afternoon the point of the needle entry site started to ache, and he became tired.  He chose to take a nap, which turned into staying in bed until today.  By the next morning the back sides of his neck, rear corners have been achy.  He has been exercising them, rubbing them and trying to work them out but they still continue to ache.  It is getting less.  The arm ache has been steady as well and has been massaging it, he can list his arm but has some difficulty with it.  No previous neck problems.  Did not take anything for the achiness.

On the 4th day after the second vaccine, I started experiencing dizziness. First time when I laid down to sleep at 10pm, I felt dizzy when I turned my head right or left. I slept on my back with head propped up for 3 nights, because the sensation continued when i moved my head right or left.  By the 7th day, most of the dizziness was minor and rare. After 10 days, I have felt slight dizziness on a rare occasion.   I don&#39;t recall have dizzy symptoms  prior to the vaccine.

Symptoms worsened and broadened to include generalized body aches, headaches, loss of appetite, and overall listlessness which persisted for approximately 30 hours but were ameliorated with Tylenol.  Reddened area appeared on left upper arm, approximately 10cm long by 8cm wide and separate from the site of injection.  The closest point of the reddened area to the site of injection was separated from it by approximately 2cm.  The reddened area was neither painful nor manifested itching.  Gradual reduction in redness and swelling noted as time progressed, but is still visible five days post-injection.

On the morning of the 02/04/21, (7:00 am) I noticed that the red area had increased in size, not itchy but still warm. Messaged my Primary Care Physician at around 9:00 am and waiting for response.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                Mild itchy rash appeared behind ears and across lower chest; it persisted for two hours until I took a one antihistamine (diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg) capsule after consulting with my primary care physician&#39;s office by phone. The rash has returned each day since, usually in mid-late afternoon, although it seems to be less intense. I have taken one antihistamine each day to alleviate symptoms after they appear. I also had pain at site of injection the following day but that has disappeared.

I must have slept at least 3 times my usual 6hrs/night both days. Also Friday and increasingly Saturday,  the injection site got much more swollen, hot and stiff than any other vaccination I have ever had. I wish I had been warned of this probability, I need to sleep on that arm due to reflux issues. Sunday morning I awoke with all health and energy back to normal. I will be sure to get my (reluctant) 2nd shot in the other arm.

                                                The patient had received the moderna vaccine and about four days later he started to develop persistent fevers and, within one week, had developed a diffuse, blotchy, erythematous rash. Bloodwork was obtained by PCP which had revealed eosinophilia (AEC peaked 4250) without evidence of end organ damage. He underwent skin biopsy which revealed:  Superficial and mid dermal perivascular infiltrate. Additionally, there are focal interface changes where lymphocytes approximate the dermal-epidermal junction and are associated with vacuolar alteration. A few eosinophils are noted in the infiltrate but they are not numerous. Vasculitis is not seen. These histologic features are not entirely specific, but are most suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction.  Initially treated with topical steroids. When eosinophil count was noted to be above 4,000 the patient was started on 60 mg of prednisone daily (this was on 1/26/21) and repeat CBC with differential are pending. The rash is improving and fever curve is also improving (on tylenol q8H PRN).  He was referred to hematology/oncology for consideration of bone marrow biopsy, as hypereosinophilic syndrome is also on differential diagnosis.

                                                69 YO M CARDIAC ARREST. PT HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS COVID VACCINATION AND WAS PULLING INTO THE OBSERVATION AREA WHEN HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS TRUCK, BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND CRASHED INTO A LIGHT POLE. THIS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE STANDBY MEDIC UNIT AND OTHER FIRE DEPT STAFF. PT WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN CARDIAC ARREST. CPR WAS INITIATED WITHIN SECONDS OF BEING REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE. EMS WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DEFIBRILLATED FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINE WAVE VT/COURSE VF WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF HIS ARREST. PT WAS PLACED ONTO A BACK BOARD AND MOVED TO AMBULANCE IN A PULSED VT AND WAS AWAKE AND RESPONSIVE. ONCE IN THE BACK THE PT WAS WIRED INTO THE FOUR LEAD AND WAS SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERTED AT 100 J WITH A CONVERSION TO A PULSED JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM WITH A RATE OF ABOUT 58. THIS RHYTHM CHANGED INTO A SINUS TACH AT ABOUT 100 BPM. IV ACCESS WAS OBTAINED AND 100 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS ADMINISTERED WITH A 2:1 LIDO DRIP HUNG. AMBULANCE BEGAN TRANSPORT TO ER. OVER NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES PT BEGAN HAVING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY IN THE FORM OF PVCs COUPLETS AND EVENTUALLY 4-5 BEAT RUNS OF VTACH WHILE ON PHONE WITH ER MD. DISCUSSED GIVING ANOTHER BOLUS OF LIDO AND INCREASING DRIP TO 3:1 DUE TO INCREASING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY. THE ER PHYSICIAN CONCURRED AND ANOTHER 75 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS GIVEN FOLLOWED BY INCREASING THE DRIP RATE TO 3MG/MINUTE FOLLOWING THE SECOND LIDO DOSE AND DRIP ADJUSTMENT THE PATIENT&#39;S VENTRICULAR ECTOPY RESOLVED AND THE PATIENT REMAINED IN A SINUS RHYTHM / SLOW SINUS TACH THROUGHOUT TRANSPORT AND TRANSFER OF CARE TO THE ER. A 12 LEAD WAS OBTAINED JUST PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN ED THAT SHOWED SINUS TACH WITHOUT VENTRICULAR ECTOPY BUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE PACs, FLIPPED T WAVES IN a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

                                                I went to my doctor yesterday  because my left calf muscle had acute pain.  He did an ultrasound to verify that it was not the result of a blood clot which was negative;  so he gave me pain pills and instructions to use hot/cold compresses.  After getting out of a tub of warm water I noticed blotches of redness (rash) above my right knee which had already begun to swell.  I also noticed that my right calf muscled is beginning to be sore and a rash was developing on my arm below my elbow.

It hurt all night and still is hurting today. It is hurting about 4 inches from where they gave me shot. From my elbow down to my fingertips feels cold. I have coronary artery disease which means when my arm gets cold like that it means I have a blood flow issue. I have two stints and I have triple bypass surgery. The pain is constant pain in the upper arm.    I sent an email over to my primary care doctor yesterday. I was advised by Oncologist advised me to get the vaccine.

                                                Injection was very high on left deltoid, felt like almost joint instead of muscle.    By evening shoulder was very sore, got worse through the night - it felt similar to a torn ligament I had years ago.    By Friday morning, I could not lift arm, started taking Advil.   This continued Saturday.  Pain started to diminish Saturday night.  Pain and mobility improved Sunday.  By Monday morning, almost 4 days after injection, shoulder was normal.   I contacted Dr. on Monday, thinking the location of the injection had caused the problem.  He was going to talk to the person who gave the injection to make sure she gives future shots in the center of the deltoid.  He also encouraged me to do this report to the CDC.

Three days after, had bumps on my head / scalp that were sensitive to the touch and a mild headache started. The headache continually got worse , starting evening of Tues Feb 9 to Thurs afternoon Feb 11 was a constant severe headache. Could not sleep, got some relief by placing cold ice pack on back of neck and on forehead.  Headache is now subsiding slowly.  No energy.

                                                In the early morning hours of 2/17 I began to feel an itching on my arm near the vaccine injection site.  It was not noticeable when I awoke for the day so I forgot about it, but the itching returned in the evening.  This time I looked at the area.  It was a rash about 2-3 inches in diameter, warm and sensitive to the touch.  This morning (2/18) the rash area had not grown, the color had subsided somewhat and the itching was again not noticeable.  Some research by my wife indicated that this resembles something called COVID arm.  It has not been a problem, but I thought I should report it to you for statistical purposes.

                                                10 days after first dose of Moderna vaccine, I developed a very sore arm  starting with sharp pain at injection site and progressively radiating throughout upper arm and shoulder area, severe enough that I could not raise or use my arm.  This lasted about 24 hours and then started to dissipate throughout the next 24 hours.  I thought this was unusual because it was so long after the injection happened, and at the time of vaccination I had experienced very little arm pain.

                                                Got shot Friday afternoon and reaction started Saturday night. Injection site had a blue coloration about 1/4 inch and began feeling like 1.5 inch of pencil was in my arm. I was feeling very warm and cold at the same time with a normal core temperature. Extreme pain on any movement of arm that caused to muscle to tense. Having a fan on me  really help my heat/cold sensation be normal.  Most of symptoms went away Sunday afternoon, pain in arm reduced and I felt lethargic but OK. Pain in arm had subsided a lot and just felt like injection pain. most range of movement pain free but it did hurt if I moved my left arm up across my chest. Monday morning  had no issues with anything and injection site had no pain on movement or touch. I could just tell I had the shot there and the discoloration was lighter.

                                                Mild pain at injection site, followed by peripheral petechial rash with itching, which started approximately 3 days after inoculation and extends, in a circular fashion, with a diameter of approximately 7 1/2 cm. The area with the rash is still present, but subsiding, after 17 days. I took Benadryl 25mg once for the itching because it is not severe.

Severe rash up neck, over the right ear, across right cheek, around right eye and across right side of nose. Our family doctor examined patient on Thursday, 2/25 and said it would get better on it&#39;s own. It continued to worsen and he was very ill with vomiting, low grade fever and chills. On Monday 3/1 he went to the ER was put on Kefflex antibiotics. The diagnosis was cellulitis.  After 7 days of treatment he is much better, the rash has dried up and only red scabs are left to heal.

                                                Six hours after the shot the injection site plus almost the entire length started to get sore and it lasted for 48 hours. My other two really bad reactions were as follows: Eight hours after shot I was shivering and cold no matter how many clothes I put on or how high I turned up the heat. This lasted 6 more hours. One hour after the shivering stopped I was overheated and sweated PROFUSELY. This lasted another 8 hours. Then the overheating and sweating just stopped and I was fine. Ps. my sister and I got the same shot, same Lot#, same day and she had the same shivering for 6 hours but not the sweating.

                                                Because of the absurd character limit in this field, I am putting my adverse reaction statement on the continuation page. About 10pm, about 9 hours post injection, I was feeling weak and fatigued.  I went to bed and was starting to feel chilled, but not shaking.  I hopped into bed and turned on my electric blanket in a room that was 75° (from passive solar house heating during the day) and wearing only a T-shirt, sweat shirt, and sweat pants.  The first post-vaccination symptom I experienced was when I laid down and my right upper arm (at the point of the injection) was very sore; it was too painful to lie on my right side.  The injection area felt hard. I fell asleep about 11pm and woke up about midnight; I am generally a very light sleeper, rarely sleeping more than ~3± hours (most less than) at a time.  At 1:30am, I could not sleep so I watched a recorded movie.  All the while, I was feeling progressively worse.  About 2:30am, I felt really chilled, so I cranked up the electric blanket to its highest setting and put on some heavy wool socks, a pair of long-johns under my sweat pants, put on another heavy sweatshirt over my existing sweatshirt, and placed another blanket on top of my electric blanket: very cold / chilled but not shivering.  The movie ended about 3am, and my stomach was excruciatingly aching.  I did not feel I could eat anything which I really felt a need to do, but was concerned that I would just vomit.  However, I did take two, 500mg Tylenol tablets with a half a glass of water.  I might have slept for an hour or so, but was quite restless.  I remember looking at the clock at 4:00am.  By 5am, it was considering calling 911; my stomach ached so badly.  It was then, that I had the feeling / recollection I had this &#34;illness&#34; before.  About 5:30am, my stomach symptoms started to ameliorate; by 7:30am, they were gone.  However, I still felt miserable.  I then wondered whether my stomach symptom was just a concomitant bout with &#34;stomach flu&#34; where I experienced (severe) abdominal cramps and pain; nausea; and low-grade fever.  I have had the stomach flu a limited number of times before and, after 6± hours, it all went away: I just had to suck it up in the meantime.  Before I filled out this report, I wanted to consider whether my stomach flu was a reaction to the vaccination or incidental to the vaccination.  However, after talking with my neighbors and my sister&#39;s friend, who also had the Moderna vaccination, three of the four &#34;victims&#34; had similar symptoms to me.  Thus, I deduced I did not have a bout with stomach flu.  Additionally, a dog walking partner, who is a rescue worker, also noted folks she knew also had similar symptoms with the Moderna vaccine.  I then started wondering what kind of artificial cocktail, a.k.a.: antifreeze, was the suspending medium for the vaccine.  If this has to be stored at absurdly low temperatures I commonly have negative reactions to artificial chemicals.  The minor surgeries I have had are uneventful but for the anesthesia chemical concoction I am given.  I commonly takes me more then 2-3 days to detoxify that and feel normal.&#39;  As in this case, I pretty much laid in bed for the next 2½ days, with no energy or desire to attend to personal issues, including walking my dogs.  However, my subclinical temperature was pretty much gone after the second day.  The notable soreness in my arm was mostly gone after two days, but the injection point was still sensitive to pressing on top of the injection site: I could still feel it.  I have a very high tolerance for pain and have never experienced anything like this.  &#34;Pain&#34; from flu, etc., shots rarely, if ever, lasts more than 10-15 minutes post injection.  There was definitely something in the suspension media that reacted with my body chemistry / biological processes.  I am NOT looking forward to the booster shot; most seem to have a reaction to the second shot that is worse than the first  unless their first shot was uneventful and the second shot had considerably milder reactions than my first shot.  The next time I will definitely have a bowl or two of jell-O in the refrigerator to help quell any (expected) gut reactions; jell-O has always been a comfort food for me in those situations. What a horribly designed survey.  This is next to impossible to complete online.  After timing out twice, I had to start over and opted to download the fillable form PDF.  Even then, I am not given the option to select the subdirectory _where_ it should be downloaded.  Fortunately, I saw the option to open it directly. If you are going to make the &#34;adverse reaction&#34; field so limited, relative to field size and the absurd online time limit, how can you expect meaningful, complete reporting of post-vaccination reactions?  This form CANNOT be fully completed in the time allotted without timing out.  This is, most certainly, a deterrent to adverse reaction reporting.  One has to wonder how many folks just gave up after getting timed out the first time. With this kind of disincentive, how good or complete or meaningful is the adverse data collection procedure?  Have you purged all the supporters?  They do not like real, accurate, objective data, particularly information that is not consistent what they want to believe or the narrative they want to spin.  No respectable scientist or decent journalist would accept third-rate data.  How can public interest decisions be made with a shoddy data collection effort?

It looks normal.  I am taking both Motrin and Extra Strength Tylenol which does very little to ease my skin pain.  I have off and on  strong skin pain like a pin sticking into my skin when sitting still and skin surface pain when my shirt rubs onto my skin.

I went to the doctor and he gave me prednisone.  I have finished the prednisone which didn&#39;t help.  I am wondering wether it is safe to get the second shot.

Rash was raised, red, itchy welts covering an area 4 inches long and 2 inches wide. Treated with hydrocortisone and antihistimine starting on day 3. Now on day 9 it is fading but still visible. I had no idea it was related to the vaccination until I was told my son in law also had a rash on his injection arm after getting the Moderna shot.

Second injection caused immediate rash, then more numbness in left shoulder and then electric nerve vibrations from shoulder to wrist to this day another month later after second injection.

                                                This my second dose. Within five minutes I experienced lightheadedness and balance difficulties. These abated after twenty minutes. The injection site arm was very sore and grew even more sore throughout the evening and I had a slight headache about 7:00 PM, a rare occurrence for me -- I often only have one or two per year. The headache disappeared within about an hour after manifesting. By about 10:00 PM I was beginning to feel a general achiness all over, mostly manifested in my joints.  By the time that I awoke on Thursday, 03/25/2021, I was aching quite badly all over. By 5:00 PM on that date I felt as if I had chills and a fever but a check with a digital thermometer showed that my temperature was 96.4F.  By evening I was aching  even more severely and in pain - mostly in my joints and hands -- took to my couch and covered up where I dozed in and out. I took a generic acetaminophen around  7:00 PM.  When I got up from my couch around 10:30 PM on the 25th, the aching had abated quite drastically and by midnight the worst was over. My temperature registered 98.0F at 10:30 PM.  When I arose from bed around 11:00 AM on Friday the 26th, both my hands were still aching and paining badly but most of the other aches in my joints had dissipated. By 6:00 PM on the 26th  the severe pain in my hands had decreased to my customary levels of pain from arthritis.

Appeared it might have been fading slightly until second dose was received at which time redness returned and area became larger.  At time of this writing, red area appears to be losing rectangular shape and is now more like two separate spots on shoulder with a curved red line connecting  the two. Each separate area seems to have a bump which are connected to each other with a raised vessel of some sort  that runs through the curved red connecting line.

                                                Woke up the next morning with muscle aches all over. Not very severe but I did end up taking some ibuprofen to lessen them. I did NOT have any fever or other symptoms. When I woke up the following morning, I still have very mild muscle aches which got less as the day went on. Also had mild tenderness at the vaccine site on left arm.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Tuberculosis (The patient was infected with Tuberculosis four years ago and was hospitalized.) in 2017.   On 22-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 22-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced RASH (rash started by the knees and genital area and rash spread out all over the body) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and FURUNCLE (Boil spot showed up) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized on 25-Mar-2021 due to FURUNCLE. At the time of the report, RASH (rash started by the knees and genital area and rash spread out all over the body) and FURUNCLE (Boil spot showed up) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   After the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, the patient developed a rash between 23-Mar-2021 or 24-Mar-2021. The son is not sure what exact date the symptoms  had started. The rash started on the patient&#39;s knees, spread to his genital area and then all over his body. The patient was hospitalized later on (the reporter was not able to remember the date). On an unspecified date, the patient was sent their primary care and to their dermatologist for follow up. The dermatologist only recommended to wash with water, since the doctor suspected it was from the Moderna-COVID-19 vaccine. Caregiver reported the symptoms were getting worse due to boils had formed.

On the afternoon at an unknown time, his leg had gotten worse.  He had severe pain on his left leg; it was painful to the touch; it was swollen and was hard as a rock.  He called 911.  He was taken to  Hospital.  Pt wanted me to report that he did not receive any treatment for his blood clot.  He received a Lidocaine patch on his knee and was given a prescription for Voltaren Gel.  (he was expecting to receive TPA to dissolve the clot like a few times before when he had blood clots but this particular time he did not)

It does  not seem to be healing.  Should I seek medical attention?

                                                No immediate adverse effects.  Very little soreness.  I was told to rub/massage the injection site to reduce any pain or swelling.  Red area, swelling, and itching appeared on the  fourth day following the vaccination.  Current size of area is approx. 12 cm by 6 cm.  The long side of the area runs vertical on my arm.  The  vaccination site is about 1 cm down from the top of the swelling, so the swelling, redness and itching mostly extend down my arm from the injection site

The patient then called 1/29/2021, and spoke with the receptionist. He stated he had a rash on thigh prior to the vaccine that seems to have worsened after getting the vaccine. I attempted to called the patient back 1/29/2021 at 1:17 pm, and again at 4:00pm he did not answer so I left a message. He returned my call 2/1/2021 and states he now has a blister like rash on his back, chest, arms, and thighs that is itchy. I advised the patient I would be reporting this to VARES, however if he develops any shortness of breath, trouble swallowing, or severe hives  to go to the ER. He is not a patient of this clinic and stated he called his PCP who referred him back to us.

Patient was also encouraged to reach out to his PCP for education/counseling on receiving his second dose of the series and to counsel on cellulitis symptoms.

                                                Adverse Event: Red itchy rash on multiple locations on the body.  Mostly on the large areas of left, front and right torso and back.  Also smaller selected areas on arms and legs. Treatment: Applied OTC topical 1% Hydrocortisone cream to all affected areas to control itching.  Bathed twice/day to clean area and reapply topical cream.  After second day started taking 24 hour allergy pills (active ingredients 10 mg Loratadine [antihistamine]).  Never consulted with a doctor. Outcomes: After taking antihistamine and continued topical treatment, rash started improving (reduced redness and itching). After 6 days of treatment, itchiness nearly gone, rash still is apparent at all sites,  progressing towards normal color.

The site became swollen, was itchy and covered the arm from elbow to armpit.    I texted my doctor and she prescribed Triamcinolone cream, which started to work after a day.  After 5 days of traetment, the rash disappeared.

                                                Late afternoon on February 18 I developed a rash on my upper arms.  The rash is worse on the upper right arm.  Over the course of the evening and night the rash spread over most of my body including wrists, upper and lower legs, ankles and butt.  In addition, my lips are swollen and the taste on my lips is salty. This morning I applied topical Benadryl to the affected areas and took two Benadryl (Allergy) tablets (25 mg).  This seems to relieve the itching which is not severe and my swollen lips may be receding.   I plan to continue with this treatment and hopefully the rash and swollen lips will subside in a day or two.

By about 7:00 pm that same evening the soreness and headache had increased and I was feeling general body achiness. It was much worse sitting or standing so I ate a small dinner and then went to bed to lie down. I felt much better to be prone. 3. I normally go to sleep between 11 pm to 1 am but fell asleep around 8:20 pm. When I go to sleep that early I often wake up during the night and will be awake for a few hours before falling asleep again. That is what happened. I slept about 3.5 to 4 hours then was up for about 3 hours then went to sleep again for about 3 to 4 hours. I think I got about 7 hours sleep which was good since my typical is about 6 hours. 4. I woke up the morning of one day after and still felt the same, that is, my arm was very sore, and somewhat swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness, and it was worse sitting and standing and much better lying down prone. Other than getting something to eat I stayed prone most of the day until later afternoon when I did manage to be sitting up for several hours. 5. By the time I went to sleep that night, again a little earlier than normal but maybe around 10 pm, my arm was very sore, and pretty swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness. 6. By the time I awoke on the morning two days after the vaccination, that is 2/20/21, everything was reduced but still there, that is, my arm was still sore and swollen but much less from the peak, and I had a mild headache and the body aches were pretty much gone. 7. By the time I awoke on the morning of 3 days after, that is 2/21/21, I felt normal.

                                                Extreme morbilliform pruritic rash. Attempting to self manage, have identified a number of foods that trigger a reaction. Sorbates common to all. Drinking copious amounts of water and vigorous exercise help, but am going from one flareup to another as I figure out what I can&#39;t eat or be exposed to. No lotions work, shampoo is a trigger, the extreme stress makes it worse. I had a very bad case of measles at ~4yrs old. Very sick for 2 weeks.

Approximately 10 to 15 minutes later, his care provider brought him to me and stated that his face was &#34; red and splotchy&#34;.  It was noted that Patient had red, raised areas on his face. Patient is non verbal and developmentally disabled, so I was unable to assess if these were itchy. I assessed his neck, chest and arms, no red raised areas noted. I placed a pulse oximeter onto the patients finger, oxygen saturation 95% or greater, heart rate 90-100&#39;s no visual signs of distress.

Lasted almost 2 whole days, better by Sunday (felt guilty for not going to church).  SIDE NOTE, when I described my side effects to my  brother he went ballistic saying that the government is lying to us, the vaccine was not suppose to contain live virus and me getting sick was proof that it did. I explained that my symptoms were a result of my immune system gearing up for a fight once it had been given the instructions as to how it should fight the battle, but no explanation would convince him otherwise (he falls for every conspiracy theory that comes along).

Friday the rash was complete from the top of my feet into my scalp, including inner thighs. Rash not in pubic area or on glutes. Rash was acting like hives with intense itching. At noon on Friday, my lips had swollen. My tongue did not swell. I had no difficulty breathing., no shortness of breath. Contacted Dr. via patient portal. Suggested protocol was colloidal oatmeal baths as needed, discontinue Valacyclovir, take second Aller Clear mid-day, and Benadryl at night. Protocol followed through the weekend, but by Tuesday, the itching was very intense. Made appointment to see Dr. on Thursday 2/25. He prescribed a six day course of Prednisone 10mg and taking hydroxyzine HCL 25mg 3 times daily to relieve itching.  By the second day (2/27) symptoms had abated. Colloidal baths  and anti-itch tablets discontinued. Finished Prednisone Rx.

After 1st shot 29 days earlier, I had sore arm (didn&#39;t look or notice the discoloration or swelling).  Pain in arm was about a 6 on first day, 3-4 on 2nd day, and 2 on the 3rd day and gone on the 4th day.

When I got the second vaccination, I was told to take Benedryl for the rash, and this helped, but there were many nights when it was impossible to sleep because of severe itching, large patches of dry skin, etc.

The muscle aches and pin prick sensations have awakened me repeatedly for the past two nights, resulting in poor sleep. After 2 1/2 days, the fatigue and muscle aches are mostly gone, but the itching\pin prick sensations (somewhat like the sensations one gets with a case of shingles, which I had once 25&#43; years ago, or when warming extremities after being exposed to extreme cold) are still intermittently present.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history provided.).    On 15-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS (dizziness) and NAUSEA (nausea). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body) and RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure).

For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   A pharmacist suggested the patient take Children&#39;s Benadryl followed by Zyrtec to help with the itching. These medicines have not helped alleviate his intense itching. On 1Apr2021, the patient collapsed and was taken to the emergency department. The patient was treated at the emergency department after he collapsed from low blood pressure. He was prescribed Hydroxyzine HCI 10mg for the itching by the emergency room physician, but the medicine has done nothing to alleviate the patient&#39;s symptoms.  Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Ras and nausea are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I am only reporting this because the clinic gave us a card to use with a smart phone to report any different occurrence.  I do not have a smart phone so I am using this approach, in case you want this information.

                                                Developed a hard rather large welt red swollen bump 4&#34; below left breast nipple and an additional smaller one 1&#34; to the right and redness trailing downward and to the sides.  I was in the 15 minute waiting area they send you to after you receive the shot.  I first noticed an itching and then felt the welt under my shirt, stuck my hand in my shirt and felt the welt developing.  Concerned, I approached the two paramedics there and they looked at it and said it looked like a bug bite but I am pretty sure it is not a bug bite and that is related to the vaccine. It&#39;s two days later and the welt is still there although smaller but still hard and still itching and sensitive to the touch but the redness that was extending outward is gone and now it consists of the main bump and the smaller one only.  The smaller one looks like a big pimple and the large one is about 1/2 &#34; in diameter with redness around that.  When researching on the internet I stumbled on this site and thought I needed to report it and am still wondering if it is anything serious.

                                                I suffered itching on my arm around and below the site of the injection. The area was approximately   two inches wide and four inches long. The itch at times was intense and lasted approximately eight   days. I applied a 1% Hydrocortisone cream topically for approximately four of the worst days. On a scale   of 1-10, I would rate the itch as a 7 to 8. I did not seek medical attention as I felt this was not a serious   threat to my health and just monitored this symptom closely. I also felt it was evidence of the vaccine   actually working and expected. The itch never prevented sleep or itched intently enough that my   scratching lead to bleeding or any more than moderate discomfort.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall as the pain moved predominately to the left calf as I leaned on the wall for support rubbing both thigh and calf and yelling to my wife.Over a few minutes, I regained mobility and have not experienced that since. I have had discomfort(sharp aching) in the left hip joint and left calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to have a numbing/tingling from the injection site down to my left elbow as well as down the left side of my leg. There&#39;s a general feeling of &#34;weakness&#34; in my upper left arm. I&#39;ve reported this to our Infection Control Nurse (who administered the vaccination) anecdotally after waiting a few weeks to see if things went away. Her advisement was to go ahead and report in to VAERS.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient let me know that he had a warm sensation  from the injection site up to the left side of his neck and tightness of the left side of his neck.  I asked if he felt like his throat was closing and he said no.  At this time, I gave the patient a diphenhydramine tablet 25 mg tablet and a bottle of water and observed him.  I took the patient&#39;s blood pressure about 10 minutes later and it was 170/75. I asked if this was a normal level for him and he said when he took it last week it was 180 over something.  I continued observing the patient and took his blood pressure again in 10 minutes. It was in the same range. The patient left approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine. He said that he was feeling better.  I called the patient to follow up at 3 pm. I asked if he was feeling better. He said, &#34;I think I&#39;m ok.&#34; I asked if he was still experiencing the symptoms from earlier and he said, &#34;No, I left those symptoms in Massillon.&#34;

These spots had small blisters w/ liquid in them.  Pt saw his PCP on 1/11 before taking the covid vax that he was given later same day.  Pt saw his PCP on the 1/14 after his developing his bad rash so his PCP thought this must have been caused by the vax.  Pt was ordered some medicine for his rash but never received it so used some Clobetasol ointment 0.5 that he uses on his everyday rash and seemed to work pretty well for it.  Pt states blister have disappeared but left black spots where they had formed.

                                                On January 18, 2021, I received my first moderna vaccine.   On Tuesday, I noticed a rash starting where I got my shot.  I was a bit black and blue on my after the shot.  The rash actually woke me up in the night because it was itching.  It isn&#39;t itching now, but it seems to be getting bigger.    I have contacted the doctor virtually.  Doctor said to keep an eye on the rash.  Took Benadryl to ease itching.

                                                The next day after the second dose I experienced severe fatigue. About 48 hours after the vaccine I started with muscle aches mainly in across the back and shoulder area. Also noted there was a rash on both legs (no itching and no pain, no bleeding) within a week of vaccination. That is when I decided to see dermatologist who said it would disappear in about 2 weeks.  I am not getting any new rashes so far. As a precaution I took regular Tylenol 1-2 hours after second dose to minimize any side effects.  Injection site was red and sore (more than first dose) for about 2 days.

No other side effects, other than moderate soreness at the site of the injection and general mild aches and pains within the first 24 hours of receiving the vaccination.  No treatment was sought.

The patient had some mild soreness at the site of the injection which lasted one to two days. On 21 Jan 2021, he experienced some ear ringing in his right ear which was followed by hearing loss that lasted six hours. Both the ear ringing and hearing loss resolved by the next morning.   On 24 Jan 2021, the patient had ringing in his left ear, but it was not associated with hearing loss. The patient stated he thinks the tromethamine hydrochloride in the vaccine may have induced his hearing loss. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, hearing loss in right ear and ear ringing in right ear, were considered resolved on 22 Jan 2021. The event, mild soreness at the site of injection, was considered resolved on an unknown date Jan 2021. The outcome for the event, ringing in left ear, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71- year old male patient who experienced hearing loss in right ear/deafness unilateral, ear ringing in right ear/tinnitus, ringing in left ear/tinnitus, and mild soreness at the site of injection/injection site pain, all within 4 days after administration of Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273). Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Initial rash was about 4 x 3 inches, but then increased in size to about 4 x 7 inches, elliptical in shape. As of 2/27, rash is still present. Contacted my PCP, who suspects cellulitis and has placed me on a regimen of antibiotics for one week--Cephalexin, 500 mg, 4x daily.

                                                About a week after getting my second dose I developed a severe, very itchy, swelling and raised bumps on my front and back torso, my face and my arms. My doctor put me on hydroxyzine and Pep-Cid because they felt Prednisone would suppress my immune system. Two weeks later he has put me on Prednisone because the first course of action did not work. I&#39;ve gotten through two days worth of Prednisone.

                                                after 3 days, developed extreme itchy feeling in upper legs and upper arms. after 2 - 3 days, small red bumps/welts appeared on both sites.  went to Urgent Care on Sunday and got scripts for steroid and atarax. also taking Allegra. Had a reaction to atarax so went on the steroid blister pack for 5 - 6 days. symptoms cleared completely but soon after itchy feeling returned along with bumps. Saw dermatology on Feb 19 and she increased meds to Allegra in the morning, Zyrtec in the afternoon and Benadryl at bedtime along with clobetasol cream. This seems to be working as most bumps have resolved but continuing just in case. Missed my 2nd dose appt and currently exploring whether to get the 2nd dose or switch to J &amp; J.

                                                Patient received first dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on 1/28/2020.  Due to his history of allergies and asthma, he took a dose of diphenhydramine 25mg (either 1 tablet or 2 tablet - patient is unsure) prior to receiving the first dose of the vaccine. He waiting for 30 minutes of observation afterwards.  He did not have any problems other than a sore arm after the dose. The patient returned for his second dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on 2/25/2020.  He forgot to take a dose of diphenhydramine prior to coming in for his second dose of the vaccine.  He sat for the 30 minutes of observation with no issues.  He drove home and after arriving home, 1 hour after receiving the dose, he started having a strange feeling around his mouth and tongue which moved from the right to left side.  He then took two doses of diphenhydramine 25 mg.  Then he started having difficulty swallowing so went to a Prompt Care.  The staff there called an ambulance and he took an ambulance. In the ED, the physicians examined him and didn&#39;t find any issues with his throat.  They noticed his left earlobe was bright red.  They administered a high dose of steroid and observed him for 3 hours.  The patient does not know the name of the steroid or dose received.  The patient states that he felt normal again after 1.5 hours after receiving the steroid injection.  The patient was discharged back home and has not had any issues since.

                                                Approximately 2 days after his second Moderna Covid vaccination, the patient experienced splotchy, rash-like redness extending from area around site of injection down the muscle towards the elbow.  He stated it was itchy but not raised or bumpy and that his arm was slightly swollen.  When he contacted the pharmacy to let us know his symptoms he had been having the reaction for about 4 days total thus far.  He was advised to take an anti-inflammatory and an antihistamine, and to contact his doctor if the reaction worsened or did not improve over time.

First noticed it 3 weeks or so after the first injection. Treated with benadryl spray/cream topically and oral to help with sleep. Not painful at first, but did develop an itching and painful area after a few days. It is now March 16th and right  arm pit is STILL red.  I had thought it was an insect bite, but did not act like that and it has  eased up, bit not gone away.  It was not until a week AFTER the Second Moderns shot in the opposite left arm  that a rash developed on the LEFT armpit/axilla area did it occur to me that it may be vaccine related and should be reported.  I have pictures.

I researched what to do and took Benadryl (still taking twice a day). The rash disappeared after about 20 hours but the redness is still there after three days.

                                                After Dose #2 of Moderna COVID-19 on 03/04/21, I developed a red rash on my left arm, in the fleshy part of my arm, down two thirds of the way to my elbow. As the days progressed, that rash moved around on my upper arm, was warm to touch and a little itchy. I also had tender points in my upper arm for a few days.  After a few days I started getting red bumps on my upper left arm and I assumed it was because I had been scratching the area. The rash and red bump area on my arm became larger and soon covered the whole of the fleshy part of my upper arm. Hydrocortisone 1% or other medicating lotions were of no help.

                                                I visited my doctor.  After he examined and questioned me about recent activities, he diagnosed me with a Stevens-Johnson response and said that my shot of the Moderna vaccine was the most likely cause of the incident.  Much of my body was covered with red blisters and inflammation.  It was uncomfortable and itched a lot.  He prescribed a six-day course of methylprednisolone tablets for me, 21 - 4mg tablets over six days.  That seemed to stop the reaction, but I still had badly inflamed hands and feet afterward.  My doctor then prescribed prednisone, 1 - 10mg tablet per day.  After another week, the inflammation was gone and I discontinued the prednisone.

It is still spreading, and has not been correctly diagnosed despite three visits to medical facilities.  The latest facility to see me, a Dermatologist, suggested this may well be an adverse reaction, and to submit this report.  I can send pictures of the condition if that would help.

Following the 2nd Moderna vaccine, he developed itchy bumps around his neck and torso, then spread to the rest of his body.   He developed blisters over his body.   He developed a sore throat and cough.  He was seen by Dr in the office twice, followed by a virtual appt,  He was treated with Ketoconazole for rash, and Amoxicillin for sore throat and cough.  .He was referred to a dermatologist and biopsy was performed.  Colobetazole topical was added.   His condition worsened, he could no swallow.  He was taken by ambulance to the ER on 3/18/2021 and he was admitted.     He is still in the hospital.  Previously he had moments of confusion, but now this is worse.

                                                I spoke on 03/09/2021 with a question from him. He received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine as Moderna on 02/16/2021. He reports he did well with his shot initially and didn&#39;t really even have a sore arm. About 6-7 days after his vaccine, however, he started getting some significant redness, warmth, tenderness and then swelling in his arm that continued to worsen. became concerned that his reaction was more than would be normally expected so he was seen by a doctor who diagnosed him with cellulitis and started him on antibiotics and steroids. He had completed his antibiotics at the time of our conversation and said his arm felt better but was still slightly red. His doctor recommended that he not get a second dose of Moderna, but suggested that he might get a Pfizer or a Janssen vaccine instead, and was wondering about our recommendation for this? I let patient know that there are no specific studies for the interchangability  of these vaccines but there is a statement from CDC that says if an individual is unable to get a 2nd dose of an mRNA vaccine due to a contraindication, they could consider getting one dose of Janssen vaccine at least 28 days after the first dose to have a complete valid J&amp;J dose. I encouraged to speak with his provider about this possibility and any further action. I did some education on potential causes of cellulitis and let him know that per immunization guidance, cellulitis isn&#39;t necessarily a contraindication to a second dose of vaccine but more of a precaution as it can be difficult to know the exact cause and a second dose may not result in the same side effect. Several times reported no respiratory symptoms or other symptoms than the cellulitis. I again recommended him to speak with his provider for the best plan of action and he agreed to this.

There was no itching noted.  No Swelling of Lymph Nodes was detected.  I took Chlortrimeton (Antihistamine), 1-tab every 6 hours since time of discovery and will continue to take this until the allergy signs are gone.  Applied a thin layer of OTC Calamine Lotion on reddish spots and rash on the skin.  The areas affected did not change on Mar. 28 and today Mar. 29.  The rash and red spots remained in the areas as first reported.

However, after approximately 14 days of receiving the 2nd vaccine, I noticed that the skin on my back began to break out with raised red spots and was accompanied with continuous itching.  As the days went by, the itchy rash got worse and spread to multiple places on my upper chest area, back, upper arms and face.  The itching became more intense as each day progressed and was constant in duration.  It also interfered with my normal sleep.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

Then, 12 days after the vaccination, a red rash started to be seen at the area where the injection was. That area felt warm. The nest two days, including today, the rash started to spread, covering a major part of the upper part of my arm. The arm is warm to the touch. I plan to go to a medical clinic tomorrow, as I am now, visiting my daughter and grandchildren, until January 24.

The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..

Skin appears normal to per pt. Worse when supine and in AM. Possible nodularity at site although does not report it consistently.

Will follow up with PCP as necessary.

That got steadily better each day, as reported to v-Safe each day.  Then v-Safe stopped asking.  On Day 9, 1/25/2021, my left arm started to itch at the injection site.  It then turned red in a 3-4&#34; area, and on Day 10, 1/26/2021, the itching was so strong that I used a calming cream (ineffective), later followed by Hydrocortisone 1%.  Today, Day 10, 1/27/2021, is moderated, 2&#34; red area, but still itching.

A couple of hours after I got the vaccine shot, a red rash, of medium color, and slightly raised from my skin, measuring about 3 inches by 5 inches, appeared.  This rash has persisted until today (February 1).  It has intermittently been moderately itchy, and has spread outward on my arm, and lightened considerably in color.

Day 1, prior to vaccine administration, BP 132/80 mmHg, Pulse 56 bpm, and temp 98.2 F.  1st dose of vaccine was about 7:30 PM on day 1 (January 7, 2021.) On day 2, at 8:40 AM, approximately 12 hours post vaccination, experienced low grade fever (99F), injection site  became very sore and lasted for nearly a week, headache, and myalgias.  SPO2 was 97%.  Pulse was 69 bpm, which is a bit higher than my usual of 50 bpm or so.   Approximately 18 hours post vaccination, fever was up to 101.8F.  Took acetaminophen 1000 mg. While trying to rest I experienced palpitations, with a heart rate of 92-95 bpm.  About 20 hours post-vaccination, fever was 101.5F.  Took acetaminophen 500 mg.  3 hours later, fever was down to 99.1F and pulse was down to 74 bpm. On day 3, at 8:15 AM, BP was 106/61, SPO2 was 96%, pulse 71 bpm, and temperature of 99.5F. Day 4, at 11:40 AM, BP 112/65, pulse 58, and SPO2 96% and temp was 98.0F.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the vaccination I begin to feel itching, burning sensation in my left wrist area surrounding the site of the surgery on Jan. 4 for skin cancer.  This increased over the next few hours and by the next morning my lower forearm was involved.  The surgical site was about 2 inches long, stitches had been removed ten days before and the wound was mostly healed.  The rash extended from the wound site toward the wrist about 2 inches, radiated laterally along the length of the wound about 2 inches on either side and up into the upper forearm another 3 inches.  There were small blisters within the rash as well.  I initially tried a cortisone cream I had left over from a previous wound.  This seemed to inflame the rash even more and I stopped.  I then applied some of the antibiotic cream I used when the wound was fresh and actively treated.  This seemed to reduce the inflammation some.  After 2 days I contacted my dermatologist who prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1 % External Cream.  I have been taking this for 24 hours, 3 applications and the rash is beginning to dissipate.  My dermatologist  indicated I was the third patient to have a rash on the same arm with a surgery and a Moderna shot, in the same arm.

                                                Three days after getting my first COVID vaccine I began to develop a red splotch and itchiness on my upper right arm at the site of the injection. It has been two weeks since I received the vaccine and the red splotch has now grown to cover most of my upper right arm on the outside in the shape of a big rectangle,  surrounding the injection site.  It is now 4.5 x 4 inches.  The itchiness has also gotten worse.

                                                After receiving the injection, I had no adverse reaction; no pain the arm or shoulder,  however, seven days after receiving the vaccine I developed a red bumpy rash at the injection site.  The rash was about 3 inches in diameter.  The site was warm to the touch ( surface temp was 101.5 degrees) and very itchy.  I also felt a burning sesation.  After two days the rash is starting to breakup into splotches instead of one large area.  Itching has lessened and burning has disappeared.  I am not taking any medical action as it seems to be going away.  I have had a slight reaction to other vaccinations but they have always occurred within 24 hours.  I have never had a reaction this pronounced or appearing after 7 days.

                                                9 days after the vaccination I awoke with a large red, rash-like spot at the injection site.  I was awakened by fairly intense itching at this site which measured about 2&#34; by 4&#34;.  Topical application of hydrocortisone and an oral antihistamine provided some relief from the itching , but did not seem to affect the rash.

                                                My arm was mildly sore at  the injection site for about 36 hours.  2/18/21 (Thurs.) ? In the morning (only) there were rashes on my L arm, my neck and my back. While I have had a few itchy pimple areas for several weeks, and am generally sensitive to everything, this is not the same. It is also not the same as the transient flushing that I have in my face for a few minutes each morning after I take 500 mg. of Niacin.   2/23/21 (Tues.) ? At 8:30 a.m. I had flushing (not quite a noticeable rash) on my back, face, shoulders and both arms, esp. the L arm. (This was 20-30 minutes after I had taken Niacin, but the brief flushing, just in my face, resulting from the Niacin was long gone before these other rashes/flushing occurred.) Later, after 9:00 a.m., there was warmth and itching on my lower back. At 9:45 a.m. I felt flushing in my thighs and lower legs. At 10:00 a.m. there was an actual red rash on my chest and stomach. This all seems unusual for one week after the CoVID-19 shot.     2/27/21 (Sat.) ? Starting at 9:50 a.m. (30 minutes after taking 500 mg. of Niacin, which usually results in immediate flushing of my face, for only a few minutes at most), I had flushing and itching, and a slight rash, on my upper chest and upper back. After a few minutes the flushing and itching spread to my lower back, and my upper arms; my upper arms had a noticeable rash, which then spread down to my hands. In the next few minutes the flushing, itching and rash extended to my upper inner thighs and lower back (although I am only assuming, based on the feeling of flushing and itching, that my lower back had a rash, since I couldn?t see there). Over the next several minutes the itching and rash extended to the front and side of my thighs, down to my knees. The rash then extended, to a lesser extent, down to my ankles. As of 10:50 a.m. I still have this flushing, itching and/or rash in all the places mentioned, although it has started to decrease. This was mostly gone by 12:00 p.m. Other than 4 days ago, I don?t think I have previously experienced this generalized reaction in my 73 years.

I now have another incident to report, occurring 16 days after the vaccination.    3/04/21 (Thurs.) ? Starting at 8:20 a.m. (20 minutes after taking 500 mg. of Niacin, which usually results in some immediate flushing of my face, for only a few minutes at most), I had flushing and itching, and a slight rash, on my upper chest. At 8:25 a.m. both arms were red, particularly on the inside of my elbows, as well as my shoulders. At 8:30 .am. my stomach was red and itching. At 8:35 a.m. I had itching and redness on my lower back and inner thighs. (Since I was just adding areas, without the previous areas of flushing, itching and rash going away, going away, my arms were now the reddest of any areas.) At 8:40 a.m. the redness and itching extended to the front of my legs, down to the shin, as well as my lower back. At 8:50 a.m. (by which time I was in a supermarket, without much chance to look at areas under my clothes for redness), the back of my hands were very red, and to a lesser extent my palms. At 9:00 a.m., the overall itching had increased further. At 9:10 a.m., my cheeks and the back of my neck felt flushed and itching. At 9:20 a.m., by which time I was home, my abdomen was very red and itching. At 9:50 a.m., I still had itching all over, esp. my abdomen. By 10:20 a.m. there was a decrease in overall itching and flushing. By 11:20 a.m. they were mostly gone, except for some itching in the small of my back. Today is 16 days after I had my first Moderna vaccination. I have never before experienced this overall reaction to anything, other than 2 days, 7 days and 11 days after the vaccination.

                                                It began this morning with pain  in the muscle of my left arm just below the shoulder. I received the vaccine in my right arm. Then I began having pain and soreness in my scalp. Tonight the pain has become a headache, and my right eyelid is very sore. The area of pain and soreness in my scalp has grown larger. I am feeling kind of fluish.  Because I had polymialgia rheumatic a several years ago. My wife and I are concerned that I have Giant  Cell Arteritis. I am praying that this is not the case, and these symptoms are a temporary  reaction to the vaccine. But it is worrisome, because GCA needs to be treated early to avoid the possibility of blindness.

The pain was minimal (2 out of 10) and subsided in another 5 days.  Otherwise I had no reaction to the vaccine.  I received my second jab 3/9/21 and got an immediate bruising at the injection site with a little pain (2/10 again) but no further issues with my implants

                                                After injection on March14th 2021 on 15th March I felt chills and a little pain at injection site but not too bad.  On 16th March at 7:30 am I started to feel dizzy and out of balance and then suddenly my hearing in my right ear went and I had a sort of wind noise in my ear but no hearing. At approximately 1:00pmmy wife called our Doctor and he said that this could be a rare side effect of the Covid Vaccine and to allow up to 24 hours for the effect to resolve itself. By 4:00pm.the effect did resolve itself but returned at 10:00amon 18th March and lasted for 4 hours. Since then I have been OK with no further effects.

He reports he developed a cough the 2nd or 3rd day following the vaccine, which was productive of a light colored phlegm, but he states this morning he coughed up blood and when he blew his nose blood came out. The patient states he first developed pain at the injection spot which resolved after a couple of days, and then the chills and myalgias onset. He reports loss of taste and eye pain bilaterally. Patient was given bamlanivimab on 3/1/21 in the ED and was discharged home. Returned to ED on  3/3/21 for worsening symptoms and inability to maintain O2 sats above 90%. Admitted to hospital for 6 days.

                                                PLEASE HELP.  I have had moderate to severe pain at upper left arm injection site starting approximately 1/15/2021, a day after the injection, until the present.  It manifests itself mostly during sleep and awakes me with significant constant pain while in a reclining position.  When I sit up, it is somewhat alleviated and I have to take extended release tylenol (650mg) to get back to sleep.  I wake up most mornings with the same left arm pain at the injections site.  On March 16, 2021, my internist examined it and found the same bump in my upper left arm and said it is definitely from the 1st vaccination.  He suggested heat on and off for 20 minutes.  I tried it two evenings in a row and the pain got worse in bed.  Since I cannot take any NSAIDs due to my aspirin regimen for Coronary Artery Disease, there seems nothing else to do, but I am worried that some long lasting detriment is happening to my body.  PLEASE HELP.  I did not have any such symptoms from the second Moderna vaccine received 2/11/2021.

                                                Prior to shot I had a very small lump &#34;pea size&#34; in my left groin area, this lump was hard and painless and had been like this for several months and up to a year or more. One week or seven days after the shot I noticed the lump had started growing in size and was now  the size of a small marble. Having no pain however, now after 23 days it has grown to approximately walnut size and is slightly painful or sensitive to touch. I have tried to schedule an appt. with my Primary Care Dr. and I finally just today have a phone appt. on 3/24 at 11:50 am.

He had no problems around the injection site, was sore for about a day but then went away.  He has called his doctor and he was informed to get an echo of his gallbladder which showed a stone, but feels it was related to the vaccine.

He got the second dose on 3/16/21 and after 10-12 hours had fatigue, myalgias and nausea which resolved within 10-12 hours.  HOWEVER, one week after second dose, on 3/23/21, my husband took a shower and noticed shortly thereafter around 8 AM a itchy rash on face and neck.  NO rash over Vaccine Site.  Over the day the rash got more intensely red and noticed blotches over his upper chest (symmetrical oval patches just beneath each nipple region).  He took 2 Benadryl Tabs at night and in morning of 3/24 the rash has improved considerably..  The rash was macular and erythematous and never raised with no blistering.   His first dose of Moderna was on 2/16/21 and lot number was 011M20M.

Within 1-2 days of receiving the latter, his headaches and vision loss had resolved.

On 3/24/2021 at around 1 PM, I felt a little chilly but had no fever. Around 3 PM, I left my desk and took 1 Aleve and reclined on recliner with blanket over me and fell asleep for about 2 hours. Upon awakening, the tops of my feet (wearing sneakers) and tops of my hands were extremely itchy. No rash visible on either.  I applied lotion to tops of both feet and hands and left uncovered.  I applied some additional later. By the morning of 3/25/2021, the itchy feeling was gone.  No other effects since this condition.

                                                Six hours after receiving a second Moderna shot, while slicing food in the kitchen, my right hand (between the thumb and middle index finger) began to burn and itch. The skin blackened over the right hand area. I immediately took a low dose aspirin for fear of a blood clot. One day later, the blackened area is still present.

Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

I have since encountered two other individuals who had the same experience.

                                                Awakened from sound sleep in morning of January 6th (~8 days post vaccination) with intense pruritis (itching) of left shoulder and arm (injection site  and bicep region). When I arose in the morning, I noticed a wide (approximately 3-inch  band) of erythema (redness) extending from injection site in left shoulder and extending along outer aspect of bicep to about 2 inches above antecubital fossa (bend of elbow).   I applied roll-on topical anesthetic (4% lidocaine) and 1% hydrocortisone cream, which diminished but did not completely eliminate the itching. Last night, I added OTC Benadryl 25 mg orally, 1 dose. Today, itching is less, but still present. On upper left arm and shoulder the erythema is slightly less, while redness is more intense, but sharply demarcated  at the base of the bicep  (about 1 inch above the elbow crease.    Seems likely this is a delayed allergic reaction. Unless instructed otherwise, will likely not proceed with second dose of vaccine.

By 1/24, the rash appears less red but has expanded to 3-1/2 to 4 inches.  On 1/21 and 1/22,  I took Allegra (180mg) but as of 1/23, I switched to OTC Benadryl (25 mg 4 times a day) and 1% Hydrocortisone Cream. I have NOT  had, thankfully, any &#34;severe side effects&#34; (like Difficulty Breathing, Swelling, Fast Heartbeat, Dizziness, Weakness or Widespread Rash). Rather my rash appears to be a delayed reaction. I plan to continue with the Benadryl and Hydrocortisone Cream

                                                MY REACTION TO THE FIRST DOSE: In March of 2020 I suffered Covid pneumonia and was on oxygen and too weak and short of breath to work for three months.  It took over seven months to return my breathing and strength to baseline. I just checked my lab and I still have IgG antibodies and a negative nasal screen for the virus. One month ago at 9 AM I received the Moderna Vaccine.  About 12 hours later I developed shaking chills and a fever of about 103, pain in my arm from the injection, and severe cough and a VERY WATERY RUNNY NOSE with severe post nasal drip which caused aspiration of the discharge.   I took Tylenol, Afrin Nasal Spray, and a Dulera inhaler and fell asleep.  I woke up at 3 AM and felt well, but at 4 AM I developed an intolerable intractable cough and severe watery nasal discharge lasting about two hours and severe dry heaves from the aspiration.  Afrin nasal spray helped somewhat but I was absolutely miserable for  two hours.    Three days ago I received the one month booster for the Moderna Vaccine at 10AM.   My arm began to become painful but it was tolerable and not relieved by Tylenol. Every time I rolled over at night the pain woke me up but I was able to tolerate it.  Yesterday I woke up with severe constant chills but my temperature was normal.  I felt very hungry and diaphoretic and felt like I had a low blood sugar,  and ate a bowl of rice chex cereal. I felt a little better but a half hour later VOMITED everything up.  I then felt somewhat better and went to the hospital to make rounds.  The nursing staff reported that about half of them called in sick due to the vaccine with severe fatigue, fever, joint pains and headaches.  One nurse reported that all her joints felt like they were on fire.  Four nursing supervisors also called in sick that day.   I then went to my office and my staff said I looked GREEN and insisted I go home.  I did not eat anything but while resting I again had SEVERE VOMITING of my breakfast at about noon.  When I felt stronger I drove home at about 1:30 PM and fell asleep until about 5 PM, still not having eaten anything nor taking fluids. My arm pain went away.  By 7 PM I finally drank some tea and felt stronger and felt like I was not going to die.   It seems that those of use who had the Covid in the past do not tolerate the vaccine and suffer severe reactions. I was unable to find any studies with the vaccine given to patients who already have antibodies.  This lack of data is a real problem.

                                                On the 8th day post injection I developed a erythematous rash ,baseball sized , at the injection site.  There was increase in local temp with severe pruritis and induration. The rash gradually spread and later diminished in size.  There is still erythema and occasional pruritis and a small area of induration which is tender on palpation approximately 3 finger widths proximal to my elbow on the lateral left arm. No other systemic manifestations are noted.

                                                On January 19, 2021 (4 days after the vaccine injection) I developed severe itching in the palms of my hands.  By the next day, January 20, 2021, I had developed severe hives bilaterally from my groin areas down to almost my knees, as well as on my buttox.  I also had severe hives in both armpits.   Both hands (palms) and wrists had become swollen and fire-engine red and the itching was maddening.  I saw a Physician who gave me an injection of Depo Medrol and a 7 day prescription of Dexamethasone, 4mg ,  take twice a day and a prescription of  Hydroxyzine HCL 25 mg, 4 times a day as needed.      The hives began to fade after 18 hours of medication and got fainter and fainter each day, along with relief from itching.   Hives were completely gone by the time I completed the 7 day cycle of Dexamethasone.   I have not had a recurrence.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine. First vaccination - 1/4/21. Second - 2/1/21. No significant reactions to either: no fever, chills, myalgias, fatigue, etc. However, about 1-2 weeks post the first vaccine, I developed mild distal finger joint stiffness and slight pain and swelling. Both hands. R&gt;L. Involving 3rd - 5th fingers. Not symetrical. No other joint pains or spine pain.  There has been slight reddish soft tissue swelling  of distal phalanges  of involved fingers. Nails look normal.  Also, few punctate red spots - sl painful; they look like punctate hemorrhages. No systemic symptoms. Not requiring medication. Findings persistant till now. No involvement of toes. No generalized body rashes. I do not have psoriasis, but these findings are reminiscent of findings one would see with Psoriatic Arthritis. I am an MD (Internist). I thought this may be interesting since it looks to me like a possible immune-mediated reaction. I do have photographs available.

I awoke with a bit of swelling, light redness, and a slight itch at the vaccination site.  I understand this is called &#34;COVID arm&#34; and am only reporting it for research purposes.  The swelling has not increased and I have no real pain.  I have no concerns about this reaction.

Then on March 1st around 7:00 pm my arm at the injection site starting itching really bad.  Looked at arm and it was very red and very swollen at the injection site.  The red/rash, swelling and extreme itching remained all night, the 2nd day and I woke up today, Wed. March 3rd and everything is fine.  My wife looked this up online and it appears that it&#39;s a delayed reaction to the Moderna vaccine called &#34;Covid Vaccine Arm&#34; and the article said to report this.  i

The pain has lasted all day.  I have taken two ibuprofen tablets so far today.

                                                #1 The 2nd injection was March 6 at noon.  #2 On March 8 at 8:15 AM  I had a sudden burning on my forehead and within one minute this burning covered my body leaving most of the skin area red in color. I also quivered lightly for about 30 minutes. The painful burning and discoloration began fading at two hours and was mostly gone by the third hour. #3 On March 9 at 11:20 AM the same event reoccurred, exactly as the previous day. #4 On March 14 at 8:30 AM I had the third attack, which was similar to the first two. #5 I would not call this a rash. It did not itch. There was a burning, buzzing feeling. I did not touch my skin. I called many phone numbers to see if I should take a Benadryl tablet, but none of the numbers we knew or were given provided any medical expertise. #6 We have photographs on these events.

V Safe stopped communicating by Friday, 3/19. I&#39;m trying to make the CDC aware that they are missing reportable adverse react because of limited follow-up. I developed itching at the injection site on 3/20 in the a.m. I note approximately a 15 cm area of erythema around the injection site. On 3/20, after a 5 mile walk I felt similar symptoms that I had in the first couple of days after the injection of lightheadedness and felt poorly enough to have to rest the remainder of the day. I am better today and was able to function, but not ready to resume exercise. How many others have had a delayed reaction that is being missed because V Safe stops the follow-up when initial signs &amp; symptoms disappear?

On fifth morning after receiving my second injection, I awoke with an irregular red rash around the injection site and minor itching. By evening, the rash had disappeared but there was a noticeable bordered area on my upper left arm, where the shot had been given, which looked like illustrations of &#34;Covid Arm&#34; in internet news stories. On the sixth morning after the injection, it was barely noticeable, although there was still minor itching.

                                                I have a history of visual floaters. Eight hours after the shot, simultaneous with the initiation of soreness at the vaccination site, these increased, while they are usually minor. Also, i experienced a new phenomenon: a translucent paramecium-shaped image in both eyes: lower left of left eye and lower right of right eye. All these symptoms disappeared after 20 minutes or so and did not recur. Yesterday, I visited my optometrist, who did a dilation to check the retina and found nothing amiss. But she thought my experience should be reported.

Pain has continued for 3 weeks transitioning to a sharper pain (approximately 5 on a scale 1 to 10) and distinct loss of strength when raising the arm as it approaches shoulder height.   Difficulty in holding heavier objects (a full water pitcher) steady, even with the arm bent at waist level.  Pain and loss of function persist today as I am writing this report.

As the rash spread across my chest (left side) and blisters appeared, I went to my physician&#39;s office on March 9. Dr. diagnosed &#34;shingles&#34; and recommended OTC meds for pain and itching. In following weeks, the rash started healing, but the pain persisted which was not relieved by Tylenol or other OTC drugs. I could not sleep, and with strong pain and upset stomach went to the ER on Sat. March 27, I was seen. I was treated at ER for pain and nausea; Gabapentin was prescribed for nerve pain.

Moderna second dose 3/16/21 - same as with first dose for first week.  About 10 days after second dose hallucinations (?); 5:00 am got up, dressed, and walked downstairs asking if I had called the police, because he said I had told him to get up and come downstairs so I could call them.  There were not problems needing the police.  We took it as a very real dream and he went back to bed.  Over the next few weeks, he experienced weakness and dizziness/vertigo  causing three falls.  Went to primary care physician who prescribed Antivert and is sending him for a CAT scan and to a neurologist for further evaluation (vestibuar neuritis?  labyrinthitis?).

I am a board crtified family physician.

It is not clear if Benadryl would be helpful and/or safe to take for this so no medication is being used at the present time. More information about this would be helpful.

                                                I have chronic afib but have not had an episode in several years.  My pulse is usually around 100.  Within hours of receiving the vaccine, my fingertips went cold and the pulse/ox gave me a pulse of 122.  This continued for several hours and restarted again the next day.  As of this writing,1600 MT 2/1/21, the effect is not noticeable.  Injection site pain is still noticeable 2 days post-injection.

It started out at  about 2&#34; in diameter and continued to spread on the upper arm  up to today,  3-4 days later.  It increased in size to about 6X6&#34; in diameter.  Patient saw his primary care MD today who said to take Benadryl, use cold compresses and prescribed a Medrol Dose Pack.  We will phone the doctor two days from now with an update.

Three days later on Saturday morning 6 Feb 2021 I noticed a bad rash on my back, under my left shoulder, and on the middle of my chest.  I went to my doctor office later that morning and they told me I had Shingles.  They put me on an anti-viral medication called Valacyclovir.  (1 gram tablet every 8 hours for seven days.)

Effects lasted 48 hours with arm redness and slightly sore lasting still through 2/6/2021, but subsiding.   My main concern was that I experienced blood in my urine on the second day after the shot, Thursday, 2/4/21 at 3:30 PM. The blood continued in varying amounts until Friday AM, at which time I did not notice any blood (could still be microscopic).

Continued unabated until treating with ibuprofen 600mg at 12;30 pm.  Continued nsaid therapy until the following morning, with relief but not elimination of pain.  Unable to lift right arm to horizontal, or to use the arm to lift or carry anything over a pound or so.  Has continued to present, although mostly reduced as of today.  Issues with sleeping, as pain increased with prone position and inactivity.  Other attempts at reducing pain and soreness have included light exercise and stretching.

Didn&#39;t notice anything until getting ready for bed. There was a raised red welt area about 2 inches wide and 3 inches long on my left arm, just below where I received the injection. Didn&#39;t itch or even know it was there before I saw it.  Today it has a more pronounced profile, no wider or longer, but raised edges or more puffy. Still no other indication it is there. I will moniter and let them know when I get my second dose.

                                                After one week, itchy red rash about 4&#34; across at injection site. Not excoriated or weeping. Easily controlled with topical hydrocortisone. Lasted about a week. I was virtually raised in a barn. For more than a decade, I frequently inhaled the dust of dried manure from numerous bird, bat, and quadruped species. Consequently, my immune system has always been ready for war; I have rarely missed a day of work in my long professional career. I suspect my &#34;COVID arm&#34; represents my normal battle-ready immune system at work.

Monday I couldn&#39;t go in for treatment, and so Tuesday I went to the ER. I had a 100 degree fever. They did some tests. The ER doctor gave me prednisone treatments.

                                                The day following the first dose of the vaccine I felt a slight itch at site of injection. Then on 2/22 at 3:00am I was woken up with swelling on both upper and lower lips. In the morning I observed a large red rash below the injection site, approximately 2 inches round. Later that day I observed welts or hives on both arms, my back, both upper and lower. They were very itchy.  I took 2 capsules (25mg each) of  Allergy Relief (diphenhydramine HCL) twice a day for 4 days and applied  Pain Relief Cream (4% lidocaine) to all itchy areas after showering and before retiring at night to relieve the itching.  The swelling in my lips receded and the rash on my right arm faded. I stopped taking the pills for the next 2 days, but the itch remained so I took the pills at the same dosage and applied the cream as described above for 3 more days and now all symptoms have resolved except for some mild periodic itching on my upper back.

About two days after that (four days post vaccination), his rash had not gone away and had spread to his arms in addition to the chest and shoulders. The patient reported that the rash itched a lot and stung. As of March 7, 2021 (ten days post vaccination), his rash had still not gone away even with antihistamine treatment. The patient did report that it was looking and feeling a little bit better after the antihistamines, which he had been taking for a few days. (First, diphendydramine in the evening, then later, cetirizine daily and diphenhydramine each evening.)

                                                Known as &#34;Covid Arm&#34; according to the internet, I experienced swelling at the site of the injection that became red, hard and sore. The affected area was about a 3&#34; circle on my upper arm. As of last week (03/10-12/21), these symptoms have pretty much gone away.

                                                He received his vaccine in the right arm and the next day it was very sore, could feed himself but that was eat.  That morning he had a temp of 99&#43; fever, and then went up to 101.4 which lasted for the 2nd day.   He had fatigue like the flu, which he just rested and slept.  He had chills 5/10, headache as well 7/10 that was with him the entire day and on the 3rd day he had minimal headache.  Had minimal muscle pain and joint pain 5/10.  Just surprised that he was affected by it, and is concerned if he&#39;s going to have the same symptoms with the 2nd vaccine.  He had COVID in October 23rd and that his symptoms were severe and he was going to have a bad time of it.  He remained severely sick for 16 hours and went to see his doctor who told him to go home and wait it out.  These symptoms were similar to but not as intense as the symptoms he had with the COVID virus.  He did not take anything for the symptoms that he had from the vaccine.  He did take some CBD oil one day and he did not take it again.  He has resolved now from the symptoms.

                                                Approximately two days after first injection I developed two red bumps on right forearm which were extremely itchy. Benadryl Extra Strength gel relieved itching for a few hours.  Red bumps spread to upper arms legs, feet and back over a period of two to three weeks. Saw dermatologist weekly for past three weeks. He prescribed antibiotic pills and topical cream including permethrin lotion which had no affect. Biopsy of one of the bumps on leg was done on 10 February which concluded the bumps were result of either a bite or allergic drug reaction. The rash/bumps are all over my body and itch intensely. Continuing to see physician in hope of finding a resolution to problem.

                                                I received the vaccine on Monday. Tuesday I felt like I had the virus again-tiredness, slight temperature, chills, intense pain at injection site, slight stomach discomfort. What surprised me and the reason I am reporting this is the symptoms, though gradually better, persisted until Friday-4 days. I was expecting to be down for a day or two, but length of the aftereffects surprised me. I had a strong case of Covid in January 2020.

                                                I just wanted to report what appears to be a minor delayed reaction to the Moderna vaccine. I received my first dose on Monday 1/18. I had only a sore arm and a minor headache for a day or two afterward. However, this Monday (day 7) I had what felt like a mosquito bite at or near the injection site and it itched quite badly that night. Yesterday (day 8) I didn?t notice much, but last night it started to itch again and I noticed that it had developed into more of a rash around the injection site (nowhere else). It was pink and somewhat warm. I put ice on it and took a Tylenol and it was much improved and it hasn?t bothered me much since then. It is calmer today, but still pink.  I am not really concerned about this, but I thought I should let you know just in case there is something else I should know or do. I plan to go ahead with my second dose which is scheduled for 2/15.

At around 6 pm I went into the bathroom and removed my shirt to apply a minor amount of trade name &#34;Cortizone 10&#34;. As I looked in the mirror I had a red rectangular rash with small raised bumps that was about 3&#34;x4&#34;.  I showed my wife and she took a look and then applied  a small amount of the &#34;Cortizone 10&#34;. The itching stops. I examined my arm again at 10:05 pm and the rash appeared the same. I went on the web-site and for Moderna, this appears not to be an uncommon reaction, not to worry and go ahead with the second vaccine. It is scheduled for 16 February 2021.

                                                Rash on stomach, leg, arm. Very short feeling in throat. Have esophagus issues so do not know if that was from that. Do not think so. Rash has come and gone over few days.

I experienced soreness for about 36 hours after the injection but did not consider this to be &#34;pain.&#34; Thus I reported nothing. I&#39;m confident others reported this same experience as &#34;pain.&#34; Your text survey should make a distinction between &#34;pain&#34; and normal &#34;muscle soreness&#34; so that you get consistent results.

Now (3 days after injection) it is sore when touched, but not painful otherwise.  After a day the soreness did not interfere with normal activity including splitting wood.  Other than that there were no noticeable side effects except that I might have been a little sleepier that than normal.  (Answer to question 20 should be &#34;mostly&#34;.

                                                Arm pain and gout.  On Feb 4 it started as a small red bump on toe with pain. then Toe swelled very quickly, redness spread through toe. Labs and uric Acid levels were normal so suspected cellulitis. received antibiotics.  Toe continued to swell/increased pain. On Feb 5 -  referred to podiatrist who drained the toe and had fluid samples tested.  Gout was diagnosed when it was positive for sodium urate crystals.  This incident resolved without medications over 10-14 days. After the 2nd Covid vaccination there was severe pain in same toe but no swelling. pain lasted only 2-4 days.

Over the following few days, the redness area gets larger and now it covers the whole upper arm. It itches may be twice a day, the swelling is reduced but the redness is persists. I am not overly concerned, but would like to know what&#39;s going on. I hope it goes back to normal over the coming few days before i receive the second dose on March 19th.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had nothing more than a sore arm after the vaccine and felt fine the next morning so I went to play golf.  On the 4th hole I started feeling light headed and after an hour or so went home and rested.  My resting heart rate after 20 minutes was 88 according to my watch.  It is normally 60-65.  My watch also indicated that my heart rate was 122 while playing golf.  My temperature was 100.5.  After a couple of hours resting my heart rate went down to 75 and temperature lowered to 99.  I felt fine the following morning but my vaccination site turned bright pink and started itching.  This continued for 2 days.  I have had no issues since Friday, March 5th.

No temperature, but skin was highly sensitive to clothing like when you have a high temperature with the flu.  Worst side effect, though, was a highly exacerbated episode of my restless legs syndrome. Even though I was on the verge of exhaustion and desperately needed to sleep, it made the restless legs so bad that I couldn&#39;t stay in bed. Sat up half the night trying to sleep in a chair. This was the worst RLS episode I&#39;ve ever had by a factor of about 10.

                                                Vaccination administration Error - This was the patient&#39;s second dose of the Covid Vaccine. He was given Moderna and should have been given Pfizer.  His first dose on 2-26-21 was Pfizer.  We feel the mistake was due to carelessness by the pharmacy staff.  No one seems to know the safety and efficacy of receiving a single dose of two different Covid vaccines.  Thus  far, 3-18-21 the patient has had no adverse effects except for a sore left arm which was the site of the injection.

I was prescribed a steroid and after the full course of five days. Nine days after the second dose I broke out in a rash and it was very itchy. The rash went from my upper legs to my neck. I was covered in hives, they were not raised. I got a Steroid pack because I was so itchy that I couldn?t sleep. I had to visit the doctor again because the oral steroids did not work. I got a steroid shot and took Benadryl. I went back two days later and had another steroid shot and a Benadryl. I had the rash for seven days and the intense itching for five days. The doctor has recommended that I do not get another RNA vaccine.

The front of my legs up to my knees also broke out in a rash.  I went to the ER but the doctor could not tell me why i got this. He thought it was eczema. He prescribed me steroids.
