Insomnia that night accompanying whole-body aches/pains/malaise.  Pain most notable in extremities. Nausea more significant at 12 hours (i.e. 6AM) but no vomiting. Significant lethargy all day 1/22/2021. Pain/nausea gone by 6PM but lethargy remained.  Slept most of the day. Symptoms gone by following morning (1/23/2021), so roughly 36 hours.   Overall these were symptoms consistent with a really bad case of the flu, minus the respiratory symptoms.  I often work through illnesses like the flu.  Couldn?t work through this.

They gave me anti-itch stuff from the injection.  Then my Lymph nodes swelled up in my throat. I went home and took my medicine and the itching stopped in about two days.

                                                A few days after my first dosage, I started getting incredible itching all over my back, as well as some on my arms and chest. I tried to ignor it but I found myself scratching and scratching. I tried all sorts of creams and washes. I hadn?t changed any soap or clothes. I put in for a dermatologist consult with my PCP. I couldn?t imagine this was from the vaccination so I hadn?t even brought it up. I finally got a derm appt for 01/25/2021.  My first Moderna vaccine was 01/27/2021 and my second Moderna vaccine was 01/24/2021. When I went to my first appt, I was told it appeared to be allergic. I did not even tell her that I had the second Moderna vaccine the day before because I didn?t think there could be a connection. I had a derm f/u on 03/25/2021. The allergic rash was no longer diffuse but in patches, mostly on back and some on chest. She thought is could be eczema, something I never had on my body. A biopsy was taken.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter considered THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia) and PURPURA (Purpuric rash) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation), NAUSEA (nausea), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools), PYREXIA (Fever) and CHILLS (Chills).    Concomitant medications were not provided.  Hepatitis panel showed a heavy viral load of more than 11 (no reference range was provided).  Per reporter, on presentation to the emergency room the patient was afebrile, had a blood pressure 183/106 mmHg, pulse rate of 82 per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Treatment included anti-hypertensives and intravenous diuretics. On day 3 of hospitalization, patient left the hospital against medical advice.  Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273. However, the reporter also indicated it could have been precipitated by the underlying thrombocytopenia, liver cirrhosis and Hepatitis C infection. Very limited information regarding the other reported events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273.

I had severe body aches, headache, muscle weakness, worse cough, injection site pain and swelling, chills, weakness/tiredness,  I felt like I had been hit by a car. I just tried to sleep and drink Gator Aid. The second day out from vaccination I felt much better. Just slight headache, body aches,  weakness.  My injection site started to hurt later in the second day. It still hurts today-seven days out from administration.

                                                10 days after receiving vaccine I experience spread hives and throat itchiness. Went to ED. Took Prednisone for the next 7 days with hydroxixyne which totally alleviated all symptoms. Also I went to my Primary Care MD for f/u. After treatment hives started again, then I started to take benadryl orally which kept my symptoms in check but today it came back worse again despite medication.

                                                About a day after the vaccine, (Thursday) I developed a mild headache and mild general aches . These resolved quickly. But  about Friday, my  right hand began to ache a bit. It became excruciating by Sunday.  My right elbow and my right ribs also hurt, but the joints in my right hand were on fire. I could not open, close, or flex it without severe joint pain. It was sore even to the touch especially at the joints.  The hand appeared to be a bit swollen as well. I took ibuprofen and it helped a bit. By Monday morning it was much better, but my hand still aches some.

I woke up at 2:30 a.m. and thought I&#39;d been hit by a truck, my whole body was aching like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced. I also got chills and was shaking I thought I was on one of those machines that shake paint cans. I also had (and still do) a headache. The body aches subsided about 10:00 p.m. (03/03/2021). It is now about 5:00 p.m. on Thursday 03/04/2021 and I still have a slight headache and I am fatigued but starting to get some energy. On my left arm where I got my shot it is very warm, red, and about the size of a goose egg in the area I got the shot.

                                                About eight hours after the injection, I noticed some hearing impairment in my left ear.  Sounds are muffled, almost as if I have water trapped in the ear canal.  I noticed this right before I went to bed, and the hearing loss is still present and similar in magnitude this morning.  There is no pain, and the hearing in my right ear seems to be normal, although I can&#39;t rule out some slight loss on that side.  Aside from a slightly sore arm at the injection site, I&#39;ve had no other side effects (e.g., no fever) from the vaccination.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

Morning after 2nd shot became nauseated; ran fever and ached all over.  He felt this was for 2 -3 days, and also very tired.  Still very tired on 4th day after shot, but no fever or aching. Patient did take Tylenol, didn&#39;t help so also 1 dose of Ibuprofen.  Take Prasugrel, so Ibuprofen wasn&#39;t really an option for him.

                                                After receiving the first Moderna vaccination in my Left arm, I started feeling pain in the area of the vaccination site on the evening of 03/22/21. As time progressed I started to realize I was losing all motion in my arm and weakness on my entire left side of my body, but assumed this was a side-effect of the vaccination .  I was not concerned until my wife alarmed me in the morning when she looked at me and noticed the left side of my face drooped and had that I had difficulty standing, no balance, little use of my left leg and no use of my left arm and hand.  At that point, 7:00am 03/23/21, my wife drove me to the ER.  I was admitted and an inpatient for 15 days including PT/OT/ST therapies at the hospital for Stroke.

                                                Approximately 5 days after receiving 1st dose of vaccine, patient woke up from nighttime sleep feeling &#39;itchy&#39; all over body. Found approximately 10 red, raised spots or &#39;welts&#39; on skin that he had never seen before. They were sporadic, NOT clustered. He described as not quite hives. He checked bed for &#39;bugs&#39; but didn&#39;t find anything. He had taken metaxolone for only the second time in his life before bed. Prior use did not elicit any type of &#39;rash&#39; as described. He applied no topical nor ingested any oral medication at this time. He mentioned he has IBS and also had 1 instance of diarrhea. He then took 1 imodium. He was able to eventually fall back asleep. When he awoke the next morning, all but 1 spot were gone and no indication this had ever happened. He has experienced a mild headache off and off since injection, but nothing significant that keeps him from his normal business.

He had bloodwork done 48 hrs after vaccination prior to giving blood. He was told that he was &#34;positive for HIV and leukemia&#34; based on that bloodwork. He was then seen by PCP and had repeat labs which were normal. He denies any further symptoms. The PCP attributed the false positive lab results to having the COVID vaccine 48 hrs prior to initial labwork.

The rash has continued after 4 weeks and is still affecting patient. Physician has given triamcinolone acetonide, decadron injection, and oral prednisone but none have helped. The only thing that seems to relieve the itching temporarily is OTC antibacterial hand sanitizer with isopropyl alcohol.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included preexisting conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. No relevant concomitants were reported.   On unk Feb 2021 (during the first week of February), prior to onset of symptoms, the patient received their first dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 026L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for the prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   On unknown date, the patient experienced a rash, but no other reaction. He reported taking no other medication when he had  received his first dose.   On 17 Feb 2021, the patient was hospitalized for his pre-existing conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. He was discharged on 21 Feb 2021. No treatment information was provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, rash, pre-existing heart failure and kidney failure red, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality the serious events kidney failure and heart failure are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 but possibly related to the consumer&#39;s pre-existing conditions of renal failure and cardiac failure, while the non-serious event of rash may be possibly related to mRNA-1273.

The itching made sleep very difficult for the next two nights.  The itching was decreased somewhat by the use of 1% hydrocortisone cream and moreso by 10 mg of Loratidine. The severity of the urticaria has decreased somewhat over the last 3 days since onset but is definitely still present.

                                                8 days after SECOND dose of moderna vaccine for covid, my husband broke out in a rash. He does have eczema in the cold winter months which we treat with over the counter lotions. At first, he thought the rash was due to the lotion we used because it started shortly after application of the lotion. (However, he has never had a reaction to lotions before over many years of using different brands and formulas). His skin was burning and itching throughout the day. By the time he returned from work, he had raised bumps over his back, upper arms, legs, buttocks, chest and forehead. He found some relief after a shower and use of an anti-flammatory cream (although his skin was still covered in the rash). By the time he woke next morning, it was gone.

                                                Day 1 after the shot: Bump around the area of shot. Light itching in the shot area. Warmer to the touch in the shot area. These symptoms lasted approx. 3 days.  Day  8 after the shot: Return of the bump around the shot area. Light itching in the area of the shot.  Since the original symptoms had gone away, my concern is the out-of-the-blues return.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine on Monday 1/11/21. There was swelling and pain at the injection site which lasted about 4 days. There was NO redness or rash at the injection site for a week. On 1/18/21 in the evening, suddenly a rash appeared which was warmer than the surrounding area. It was tender and about the size of a half dollar. It rapidly grew in size, on 1/20/21 it is now about 3x3.5 inches across and is still growing. I have called the Public Health Dept where I got the vaccination, without getting a response (3 times). I called Moderna, and was given a case Number: MOD21-09316. Batch number was 025J20-2A. They were not able to tell me anything beyond what I could read online. (It is odd that my injection site reaction was delayed a week.) I emailed my doctor and attached a photo. I am waiting to hear back.

Went to bed at 8:00 due to fatigue.  Felt nauseated.   Was hurting really bad with the joint pain that lasted until about 2:30 AM.   He woke up this morning and is feeling much better.   He did not take anything for the pain.  It attacked his joints mainly his ankles and knees and was not able to move.  His knees felt hot to the touch.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

                                                Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity.   I developed a red, raised, itchy skin reaction over the vaccine injection site one week after receiving the Moderna COVID -19 vaccination.  My upper left arm was puffy and tender.   The itching is eased with topical hydrocortisone.  I am only one day into this, but it is so far a minor issue.  I spoke with my primary care physician and they suggested ice and Benedryl if the symptoms persisted and said the issue may last a week or so.

Came back to clinic at 0800 on 01/06/2021 c/o excruciating pain in entire L arm radiating to neck, chest, and around his upper and lower back. States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

                                                Within 24 hours, I began experiencing bouts of severe pruritis starting in the lower extremities. Rash developed in areas of excoriation due to severe itching, pinpoint red macules.  The episodes of pruritis were not responsive to Benadryl Zyrtec or Claritin. For two nights I took Vistaril with mild relief. Medrol dose pack was ineffective. Over the next week the episodes increased in intensity and frequency and were often accompanied by localized redness and superficial swelling of the skin and hive like raised areas of the skin as in urticaria. The areas of localized pruritis migrated  over a period  lasting  7 to 10 days,  first to inner surfaces of both my arms, then to my lower back, and then to my upper back over scapulae and shoulders. Concurrently, the pruritis and rash began resolving in the lower extremities and then on the inner aspect of my upper extremities. Currently,  the intensity and frequency of the pruritis has decreased significantly  and is now localized to my upper back.   Yesterday was the first day that I did not require antihistamines.

At the recommendation of my doctor responded by applying ice to the area twice a day, applying cortisone cream 3 or 4 times a day and taking Benadryl at bedtime.   It is 90% better at the time of this report approximately 4 days after the first symptoms.

                                                Severe chills the night of the shot, teeth chattering, couldn&#39;t get warm;  next afternoon, chills resumed mid afternoon.  Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

                                                Seven days after receiving my first Moderna shot for Covid-19, I developed a large pink colored oval rash around the injection site on my left arm.  The rash also itched.   Doing some online research I believe I developed a case of &#34;Covid-Arm&#34;.   I am treating the rash with a cortisone cream.   I have had the rash now for two days.  It is not getting worse but is still very prevalent.   My initial side effects from the injection consisted of a sore arm for two days and a mild, dull headache that responded to one dose of Tylenol.  Otherwise I had no initial side effects from the first dose.

The site where the injection was given had bruised and is now fading and is a yellowish color.  Directly below the injection site and its bruised area is a hot feeling, itchy red rash.  Through the course of the day, the red rash has increased in size, approximately 3.5 inch in diameter.  The same day around 5:30 PM I begin to feel a pain/ache in right shoulder and up into my neck on the right side.  The pain level gains and the level of pain reaches 5 in about two hours.  The aching seems deep beneath the shoulder bone and into the spine of the neck.  The rash and pain remain to present, 2/28/2021 Sunday.  The rash maintained the same side and began to slowly disappear yesterday, 2/27/2021 Sunday late evening.  The pain was at it&#39;s worst with arm and shoulder movement but was worse, even without movement of the arm and shoulder between 2/26/2021 Friday and 2/27/2021 Saturday, even when in bed, interrupting my sleep.  On 2/27/2021 Saturday evening the red rash had noticeable fading and the pain level began to decrease.   Today 2/28/2021 the red rash is almost goin and the neck and shoulder pain is no worse than level 1.

                                                I had normal injection site sensitivity after the initial 1st dose, and that cleared within 2 days.  Then on the 6th day post injection, my upper arm started feel hot and taught, hard to the touch and itched.  Not really pain in the muscle but more of a large red skin irritation has increased in symptoms all day.  I have read there is a slight chance of Cutaneous Hypersensitivity, and presume that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, but thought I should report it.  I have not seen a Dr. at this point.  Will try Benadryl or hydrocortisone cream in the morning if not improving.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional.

                                                Injection was given very close to the shoulder joint in my left arm, as a result within a few hours a very sharp pain in my shoulder caused me to be unable to lift my left arm without extreme pain, not muscle pain. By 4:00 pm I was sapped of energy. During the night I developed chills and ran a fever of 100.4 F. By Sunday morning I felt nauseous, but did not vomit. At 2:00pm 12/10/2020 my fever has lowered and the nausea has subsided, but the shoulder joint is still very sore.

                                                1. Initial reaction was site injection pain for several days.  2. After a week, the pain was gone, but the injection area emanated heat. 3. On the 14th day after injection, a red rash broke out from the shoulder down to almost the elbow.  Doctor advised taking Benadryl.  By the 15th day (today), further spread of the rash has ceased, but area is somewhat itchy. Will continue Benadryl.

Rash centered around the site of the injection on the right deltoid.  Rash diameter approximately 3 inches.  No pain noted past the initial 2-3 days post injection.  Initial post injection pain was mild as would be expected and not thought to be at all unusual.  At the time of this report filing the rash persists but to a lessor extent and is considered mild.

                                                Initial pain and slight swelling at injection site. Discomfort lasted 3 -4 days  About 7 days after injection a very itchy rash developed on my left arm, chest, and right arm. The rash are small, prickly red spots that cover most of the area on my arms and upper chest.  It is so itchy that I broke the skin while scratching in my sleep. I googled the condition and find that my symptoms do not match most others as it is not localized at the injection site.

The first shot I had a bad rash 14 days after receiving the vaccine.  This was treated with Benadryl and hydrocortisone and within two weeks, it was almost gone. Therefore, I was advised by my doctor to get the 2nd shot in the other arm.  Within 24 hours of the second shot, the same rash broke out from shoulder to elbow that happened after the first shot. In addition, at the same time, my right armpit gland became very swollen and sensitive to the touch.  Doctor advised to again use Benadryl for 48 hours and hyrdocortisone.

They were located on my upper thighs down to my ankles on both legs. They had no pain and did not itch.  I had a combined total of approximately 25-30 of them . As of today&#39;s date they are  still healing and are approximately 95% gone.

About 11 hours after injection (9:00 pm) there were chills/shivers for about 6 hours. Temperature was 97.6. General fatigue and malaise the next day. Again at 9:00 pm there was less severe chills/shivers for about 2 hours. No other effects after that. Minor soreness at the injection site.  Perhaps minor reaction but I thought it would be beneficial to report.

                                                One week post injection, on February 18, I developed  chills and a fever starting around 9 PM. I experienced diarrhea starting around 10 PM. Fever was approx 100.4 F and was accompanied by a splitting headache and significant body aches, to the point where I was unable to get any sleep that night. I noticed Covid arm the next morning. Fever, headache and body aches continued until Monday morning. I took only Extra Strength Tylenol. Most of the time Tylenol was effective only for the first 2-3 hrs before the discomfort overcame it. I was tested twice for COVID, both Friday AM and Monday AM. Both came back negative. Starting Monday the body aches and fever began to subside but I was left with a feeling of exhaustion and required continuous sleep.  Today is the first day I feel back to normal. I still have a large Covid arm rash, two weeks post injection. It causes no discomfort whatsoever.

Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

                                                Since I received the shot at the end of January my arm has been sore at the injection site. It was very sore for the first 4-5 days after receiving the shot. The pain was continuously subsiding over the next weeks, but for the last 5 days there has been no change. It feels as if the pain has now stabilized. My arm is not debilitated, but the upper arm is sore and the pain is noticeable. Will I have to live with this pain for the rest of my life? I am supposed to get the 2nd shot tomorrow and I am very worried. Should I get the 2nd shot or no? If I decide to get the 2nd shot, I will have to do it in my other arm. Then, will I have 2 sore arms for the rest of my life? I have not done anything concerning treatment, since the soreness has to wear off on its own. There is no magic bullet. The question is, Will the soreness ever completely disappear? It has been a month now, and I have never had this kind of long-term soreness to any injection or vaccine before.

Results came back as showing signs of AFib. Never saw this before. I have checked the ECG app on the watch  on and off since getting it in December. Every time  before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine the results came back as normal Sinus rhythm. Since February 18th my ECG on the apple watch has indicated Afib, going on 11 days now.

Per wife - patient became clammy, very warm, unresponsive, gurgling at the mouth. I ran out to check on patient Pharm.D.  They asked if they could remove his mask , i told them YES! he had a cloth mask over an n95 mask! Upon inspection, patient was not talking to me like he was prior to vaccine. They said patient gets tired and can become out of it, so they were not sure if this was a rxn to vaccine or just one of his episodes.  Patient has prior hx of 3 times stroke and is on dialysis. He did not appear to be in anaphylaxis and was breathing (when looking at chest). We called code white to pharmacy, and  Manager called EMS 5:44pm. Pharm.D came out to assist me 5:45pm. It was difficult to get a pulse using fingers, so we used BP cuff and got 83/57, with 87 BPM 547pm. I had epi pen ready to go in case we needed to use it but wanted to wait since patient was still breathing. While waiting for EMS, patient became responsive and began to talk. EMS showed up and took over. At this time Patient was talking and joking. 550 pm We decided we wanted patient to be checked out prior to sending him on his way. EMS asked us what we had done, and we discussed the above. EMS took over from there 555pm. Everything turned out ok, EMS left without further intervention. Before they left, I went to speak to family, and they were very happy due to the care they received. Event ending @ 6:15pm

I routinely get hives but this was different.  Normally one dose of hive medicine 5mg will stop the itching  instead I had to take a double dose and then another double dose four hours later.  The next day I was still having itching issues and had to repeat the same large soes of hive medicine.  Brought it under control.  Felt bad for an additional two days .

                                                After receiving the vaccine, no problems until I woke up in the middle of the night, and I was sore and my arm was hurting and I was sweating. I started having chills. I have a fever, still with aches and pains. The soreness at the injection site is about gone. Yesterday, 01.03.21, I was running a fever between 99-101 all night long. Last night I took one Tylenol to help slow it down a little. It&#39;s been pretty severe up until now. Right now my temp is 98.1.  I did not go to the ER and my wife has the lot number in her purse with her right now.

It peaked about a week ago - bumps, some with red dots, splotchy and is better now.  I thought it was dry skin or heat rash, itched a little from time to time.  I started applying Ceravae about a week to 10 days ago and it seemed to help. I haven&#39;t had any diet changes, no changes in laundry soap or been anywhere around poison ivy, oak of sumac.  The only change we can think of preceding there rash  during this period was the COVID vaccine.

                                                This is to report my reaction to the Covid19 vaccination. Yesterday, January 26, 2021, I took the Covid19 vaccination at 2:50 pm. Around 10:00 pm I started to feel soreness running up my arm to my shoulder and down to my forearm from the injection site. All night, the pain kept getting worse. By 3:00 am the pain reached a level 8 with any movement jumping to an intolerable level 10, the worst pain I&#39;ve ever experienced from any vaccination I&#39;ve ever have taken. Needless to say, I was in pain all night. I have no other symptoms at this time. Should I be concerned?

HCP approached vehicle where a 68yo white male was sitting in his vehicle on the driver side. Quick assessment revealed erythema of the face and angioedema. Pt was able to speak clearly, was CTA and had RRR. 911 was called. BP 160/90.  EpiPen dose 1 was injected into right vastus lateralis and pt reported improvement at 1057.  HCP asked for injectable diphenhydramine. HCP continued to monitor pt with RRR and CTA but erythema and angioedema began again along with swollen tongue so EpiPen dose 2 was injected into right vastus lateralis. 50mg IM diphenhydramine was injected into the right deltoid while fire rescue began to arrive on scene. Pt did not report difficulty breathing. Pt did report previous anaphylaxis to fire ant bites/stings and did report being allergic to bee stings. Fire rescue transported patient without difficulty. HCP called pt later that night at 2030 who reported doing better but still having tongue swelling.

                                                Note: Patient (me) reports similar adverse reaction to BOTH 1st &amp; 2nd Moderna vaccinations.   Chills and general body/joint aches started approx 26-30 hrs post injection.  Fever (101.2F) peaked ~ 36 hrs after 1st injection.  Mild but obvious headache ceased after 48 hrs.  No injection site rash, just soreness of the arm (like all of my previous flu vaccinations).   Second vaccination was followed with chills and peak fever of 101.4F along same time interval.  Current 02/25/21 at 2:30 pm pacific fever has ?broke? with some sweating.  Feeling much better.  I know these symptoms are positive evidence that body is geared up building the protection system for which we are vaccinated. Self-medicated with acetaminophen (500 mg) to relieve aches. Thank you!!

The soreness was gone at 48 hours. The redness continues at 72 hours. The redness patch was about 6 cm wide and 6 cm tall . After 30 hours the patch appeared to be clearing at the top and moving further down the arm. At 72 hours the redness had lightened, had mostly cleared the deltoid, had widened slightly, had a somewhat diagonal movement downward extending 8to 10 cm in the bicep area. There was also a slight headache in the first 24 hours and again at 64 hours after shot.

                                                The day of my second Vaccine 02/11/2021 at around 5:00 PM I was feeling fine and was sitting in the toilet and pulled my pants down and was horrified to see my whole sexual organ inflated. I quickly took Benadryl and a few hours later it started to get back to normal. It did not hurt or anything but slowly got back to normal. The next day 02/112/2021 I was itching on the right side of my stomach and had a big red bump. I kept taking Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for the next 7 days because otherwise as soon as i stopped taking the medicine I would have itching and bumps in my arms and side of my stomach. I had my lips swollen, my right eye lid droop. I still have episodes of itching and bumps  16 days after vaccine

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                Mild itchy rash appeared behind ears and across lower chest; it persisted for two hours until I took a one antihistamine (diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg) capsule after consulting with my primary care physician&#39;s office by phone. The rash has returned each day since, usually in mid-late afternoon, although it seems to be less intense. I have taken one antihistamine each day to alleviate symptoms after they appear. I also had pain at site of injection the following day but that has disappeared.

I must have slept at least 3 times my usual 6hrs/night both days. Also Friday and increasingly Saturday,  the injection site got much more swollen, hot and stiff than any other vaccination I have ever had. I wish I had been warned of this probability, I need to sleep on that arm due to reflux issues. Sunday morning I awoke with all health and energy back to normal. I will be sure to get my (reluctant) 2nd shot in the other arm.

                                                The patient had received the moderna vaccine and about four days later he started to develop persistent fevers and, within one week, had developed a diffuse, blotchy, erythematous rash. Bloodwork was obtained by PCP which had revealed eosinophilia (AEC peaked 4250) without evidence of end organ damage. He underwent skin biopsy which revealed:  Superficial and mid dermal perivascular infiltrate. Additionally, there are focal interface changes where lymphocytes approximate the dermal-epidermal junction and are associated with vacuolar alteration. A few eosinophils are noted in the infiltrate but they are not numerous. Vasculitis is not seen. These histologic features are not entirely specific, but are most suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction.  Initially treated with topical steroids. When eosinophil count was noted to be above 4,000 the patient was started on 60 mg of prednisone daily (this was on 1/26/21) and repeat CBC with differential are pending. The rash is improving and fever curve is also improving (on tylenol q8H PRN).  He was referred to hematology/oncology for consideration of bone marrow biopsy, as hypereosinophilic syndrome is also on differential diagnosis.

                                                69 YO M CARDIAC ARREST. PT HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS COVID VACCINATION AND WAS PULLING INTO THE OBSERVATION AREA WHEN HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS TRUCK, BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND CRASHED INTO A LIGHT POLE. THIS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE STANDBY MEDIC UNIT AND OTHER FIRE DEPT STAFF. PT WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN CARDIAC ARREST. CPR WAS INITIATED WITHIN SECONDS OF BEING REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE. EMS WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DEFIBRILLATED FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINE WAVE VT/COURSE VF WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF HIS ARREST. PT WAS PLACED ONTO A BACK BOARD AND MOVED TO AMBULANCE IN A PULSED VT AND WAS AWAKE AND RESPONSIVE. ONCE IN THE BACK THE PT WAS WIRED INTO THE FOUR LEAD AND WAS SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERTED AT 100 J WITH A CONVERSION TO A PULSED JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM WITH A RATE OF ABOUT 58. THIS RHYTHM CHANGED INTO A SINUS TACH AT ABOUT 100 BPM. IV ACCESS WAS OBTAINED AND 100 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS ADMINISTERED WITH A 2:1 LIDO DRIP HUNG. AMBULANCE BEGAN TRANSPORT TO ER. OVER NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES PT BEGAN HAVING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY IN THE FORM OF PVCs COUPLETS AND EVENTUALLY 4-5 BEAT RUNS OF VTACH WHILE ON PHONE WITH ER MD. DISCUSSED GIVING ANOTHER BOLUS OF LIDO AND INCREASING DRIP TO 3:1 DUE TO INCREASING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY. THE ER PHYSICIAN CONCURRED AND ANOTHER 75 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS GIVEN FOLLOWED BY INCREASING THE DRIP RATE TO 3MG/MINUTE FOLLOWING THE SECOND LIDO DOSE AND DRIP ADJUSTMENT THE PATIENT&#39;S VENTRICULAR ECTOPY RESOLVED AND THE PATIENT REMAINED IN A SINUS RHYTHM / SLOW SINUS TACH THROUGHOUT TRANSPORT AND TRANSFER OF CARE TO THE ER. A 12 LEAD WAS OBTAINED JUST PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN ED THAT SHOWED SINUS TACH WITHOUT VENTRICULAR ECTOPY BUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE PACs, FLIPPED T WAVES IN a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

It hurt all night and still is hurting today. It is hurting about 4 inches from where they gave me shot. From my elbow down to my fingertips feels cold. I have coronary artery disease which means when my arm gets cold like that it means I have a blood flow issue. I have two stints and I have triple bypass surgery. The pain is constant pain in the upper arm.    I sent an email over to my primary care doctor yesterday. I was advised by Oncologist advised me to get the vaccine.

                                                Couple days after slight pain in arm at injection site. Three days after, had bumps on my head / scalp that were sensitive to the touch and a mild headache started. The headache continually got worse , starting evening of Tues Feb 9 to Thurs afternoon Feb 11 was a constant severe headache. Could not sleep, got some relief by placing cold ice pack on back of neck and on forehead.  Headache is now subsiding slowly.  No energy.

                                                Injection was very high on left deltoid, felt like almost joint instead of muscle.    By evening shoulder was very sore, got worse through the night - it felt similar to a torn ligament I had years ago.    By Friday morning, I could not lift arm, started taking Advil.   This continued Saturday.  Pain started to diminish Saturday night.  Pain and mobility improved Sunday.  By Monday morning, almost 4 days after injection, shoulder was normal.   I contacted Dr. on Monday, thinking the location of the injection had caused the problem.  He was going to talk to the person who gave the injection to make sure she gives future shots in the center of the deltoid.  He also encouraged me to do this report to the CDC.

                                                10 days after first dose of Moderna vaccine, I developed a very sore arm  starting with sharp pain at injection site and progressively radiating throughout upper arm and shoulder area, severe enough that I could not raise or use my arm.  This lasted about 24 hours and then started to dissipate throughout the next 24 hours.  I thought this was unusual because it was so long after the injection happened, and at the time of vaccination I had experienced very little arm pain.

Red area, swelling, and itching appeared on the  fourth day following the vaccination.  Current size of area is approx. 12 cm by 6 cm.  The long side of the area runs vertical on my arm.  The  vaccination site is about 1 cm down from the top of the swelling, so the swelling, redness and itching mostly extend down my arm from the injection site

                                                Patient was given vaccine on 1/25/2021, he was observed for 30 minutes, and did well. The patient then called 1/29/2021, and spoke with the receptionist. He stated he had a rash on thigh prior to the vaccine that seems to have worsened after getting the vaccine. I attempted to called the patient back 1/29/2021 at 1:17 pm, and again at 4:00pm he did not answer so I left a message. He returned my call 2/1/2021 and states he now has a blister like rash on his back, chest, arms, and thighs that is itchy. I advised the patient I would be reporting this to VARES, however if he develops any shortness of breath, trouble swallowing, or severe hives  to go to the ER. He is not a patient of this clinic and stated he called his PCP who referred him back to us.

                                                After receiving the 1st dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine about 11:30 am on 2/18/21: 1. About 4:00 pm that same afternoon I started to feel some soreness around the injection area and a slight headache. 2. By about 7:00 pm that same evening the soreness and headache had increased and I was feeling general body achiness. It was much worse sitting or standing so I ate a small dinner and then went to bed to lie down. I felt much better to be prone. 3. I normally go to sleep between 11 pm to 1 am but fell asleep around 8:20 pm. When I go to sleep that early I often wake up during the night and will be awake for a few hours before falling asleep again. That is what happened. I slept about 3.5 to 4 hours then was up for about 3 hours then went to sleep again for about 3 to 4 hours. I think I got about 7 hours sleep which was good since my typical is about 6 hours. 4. I woke up the morning of one day after and still felt the same, that is, my arm was very sore, and somewhat swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness, and it was worse sitting and standing and much better lying down prone. Other than getting something to eat I stayed prone most of the day until later afternoon when I did manage to be sitting up for several hours. 5. By the time I went to sleep that night, again a little earlier than normal but maybe around 10 pm, my arm was very sore, and pretty swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness. 6. By the time I awoke on the morning two days after the vaccination, that is 2/20/21, everything was reduced but still there, that is, my arm was still sore and swollen but much less from the peak, and I had a mild headache and the body aches were pretty much gone. 7. By the time I awoke on the morning of 3 days after, that is 2/21/21, I felt normal.

Approximately 10 to 15 minutes later, his care provider brought him to me and stated that his face was &#34; red and splotchy&#34;.  It was noted that Patient had red, raised areas on his face. Patient is non verbal and developmentally disabled, so I was unable to assess if these were itchy. I assessed his neck, chest and arms, no red raised areas noted. I placed a pulse oximeter onto the patients finger, oxygen saturation 95% or greater, heart rate 90-100&#39;s no visual signs of distress.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history provided.).    On 15-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS (dizziness) and NAUSEA (nausea). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body) and RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department), HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure), DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), DIZZINESS (dizziness), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body), RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck) and NAUSEA (nausea) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   A pharmacist suggested the patient take Children&#39;s Benadryl followed by Zyrtec to help with the itching. These medicines have not helped alleviate his intense itching. On 1Apr2021, the patient collapsed and was taken to the emergency department. The patient was treated at the emergency department after he collapsed from low blood pressure. He was prescribed Hydroxyzine HCI 10mg for the itching by the emergency room physician, but the medicine has done nothing to alleviate the patient&#39;s symptoms.

                                                Developed a hard rather large welt red swollen bump 4&#34; below left breast nipple and an additional smaller one 1&#34; to the right and redness trailing downward and to the sides.  I was in the 15 minute waiting area they send you to after you receive the shot.  I first noticed an itching and then felt the welt under my shirt, stuck my hand in my shirt and felt the welt developing.  Concerned, I approached the two paramedics there and they looked at it and said it looked like a bug bite but I am pretty sure it is not a bug bite and that is related to the vaccine. It&#39;s two days later and the welt is still there although smaller but still hard and still itching and sensitive to the touch but the redness that was extending outward is gone and now it consists of the main bump and the smaller one only.  The smaller one looks like a big pimple and the large one is about 1/2 &#34; in diameter with redness around that.  When researching on the internet I stumbled on this site and thought I needed to report it and am still wondering if it is anything serious.

                                                I suffered itching on my arm around and below the site of the injection. The area was approximately   two inches wide and four inches long. The itch at times was intense and lasted approximately eight   days. I applied a 1% Hydrocortisone cream topically for approximately four of the worst days. On a scale   of 1-10, I would rate the itch as a 7 to 8. I did not seek medical attention as I felt this was not a serious   threat to my health and just monitored this symptom closely. I also felt it was evidence of the vaccine   actually working and expected. The itch never prevented sleep or itched intently enough that my   scratching lead to bleeding or any more than moderate discomfort.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall as the pain moved predominately to the left calf as I leaned on the wall for support rubbing both thigh and calf and yelling to my wife.Over a few minutes, I regained mobility and have not experienced that since. I have had discomfort(sharp aching) in the left hip joint and left calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to have a numbing/tingling from the injection site down to my left elbow as well as down the left side of my leg. There&#39;s a general feeling of &#34;weakness&#34; in my upper left arm. I&#39;ve reported this to our Infection Control Nurse (who administered the vaccination) anecdotally after waiting a few weeks to see if things went away. Her advisement was to go ahead and report in to VAERS.

I have hadintervals of sharp aching in the hip joint and calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to experience a numbness/tingling from the injection site to my elbow as well as along my left leg and a general weakness in my left arm. After waiting a few weeks to see if things would change,I reported it anecdotally to our Infection Control Nurse and she advised me to report to VAERS.

These spots had small blisters w/ liquid in them.  Pt saw his PCP on 1/11 before taking the covid vax that he was given later same day.  Pt saw his PCP on the 1/14 after his developing his bad rash so his PCP thought this must have been caused by the vax.  Pt was ordered some medicine for his rash but never received it so used some Clobetasol ointment 0.5 that he uses on his everyday rash and seemed to work pretty well for it.  Pt states blister have disappeared but left black spots where they had formed.

                                                On January 18, 2021, I received my first moderna vaccine.   On Tuesday, I noticed a rash starting where I got my shot.  I was a bit black and blue on my after the shot.  The rash actually woke me up in the night because it was itching.  It isn&#39;t itching now, but it seems to be getting bigger.    I have contacted the doctor virtually.  Doctor said to keep an eye on the rash.  Took Benadryl to ease itching.

The patient had some mild soreness at the site of the injection which lasted one to two days. On 21 Jan 2021, he experienced some ear ringing in his right ear which was followed by hearing loss that lasted six hours. Both the ear ringing and hearing loss resolved by the next morning.   On 24 Jan 2021, the patient had ringing in his left ear, but it was not associated with hearing loss. The patient stated he thinks the tromethamine hydrochloride in the vaccine may have induced his hearing loss. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, hearing loss in right ear and ear ringing in right ear, were considered resolved on 22 Jan 2021. The event, mild soreness at the site of injection, was considered resolved on an unknown date Jan 2021. The outcome for the event, ringing in left ear, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71- year old male patient who experienced hearing loss in right ear/deafness unilateral, ear ringing in right ear/tinnitus, ringing in left ear/tinnitus, and mild soreness at the site of injection/injection site pain, all within 4 days after administration of Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273). Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                About a week after getting my second dose I developed a severe, very itchy, swelling and raised bumps on my front and back torso, my face and my arms. My doctor put me on hydroxyzine and Pep-Cid because they felt Prednisone would suppress my immune system. Two weeks later he has put me on Prednisone because the first course of action did not work. I&#39;ve gotten through two days worth of Prednisone.

Contacted my PCP, who suspects cellulitis and has placed me on a regimen of antibiotics for one week--Cephalexin, 500 mg, 4x daily.

                                                after 3 days, developed extreme itchy feeling in upper legs and upper arms. after 2 - 3 days, small red bumps/welts appeared on both sites.  went to Urgent Care on Sunday and got scripts for steroid and atarax. also taking Allegra. Had a reaction to atarax so went on the steroid blister pack for 5 - 6 days. symptoms cleared completely but soon after itchy feeling returned along with bumps. Saw dermatology on Feb 19 and she increased meds to Allegra in the morning, Zyrtec in the afternoon and Benadryl at bedtime along with clobetasol cream. This seems to be working as most bumps have resolved but continuing just in case. Missed my 2nd dose appt and currently exploring whether to get the 2nd dose or switch to J &amp; J.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

                                                No initial symptom other than soreness in arm for about 2 days. Then, 12 days after the vaccination, a red rash started to be seen at the area where the injection was. That area felt warm. The nest two days, including today, the rash started to spread, covering a major part of the upper part of my arm. The arm is warm to the touch. I plan to go to a medical clinic tomorrow, as I am now, visiting my daughter and grandchildren, until January 24.

(&#43;) dermatographia. Over the last week there has been some improvement but 2 new papules developed on L inner thigh and R upper arm. No treatment. as it didn&#39;t bother me enough. Saw my dermatologist yesterday for routine f/u and he confirmed that Dermatologists are seeing an urticarial rash 1-3 weeks after the vaccine.. The question is: should I get the second shot in a week?

The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

Skin appears normal to per pt. Worse when supine and in AM. Possible nodularity at site although does not report it consistently.  Yesterday 1/25/21 was advised warm compresses and Tylenol for pain given pt&#39;s cardiac history, as well as PCP follow-up. Today reports decreased arm pain and improvement with heat. Will follow up with PCP as necessary.

That got steadily better each day, as reported to v-Safe each day.  Then v-Safe stopped asking.  On Day 9, 1/25/2021, my left arm started to itch at the injection site.  It then turned red in a 3-4&#34; area, and on Day 10, 1/26/2021, the itching was so strong that I used a calming cream (ineffective), later followed by Hydrocortisone 1%.  Today, Day 10, 1/27/2021, is moderated, 2&#34; red area, but still itching.

Day 1, prior to vaccine administration, BP 132/80 mmHg, Pulse 56 bpm, and temp 98.2 F.  1st dose of vaccine was about 7:30 PM on day 1 (January 7, 2021.) On day 2, at 8:40 AM, approximately 12 hours post vaccination, experienced low grade fever (99F), injection site  became very sore and lasted for nearly a week, headache, and myalgias.  SPO2 was 97%.  Pulse was 69 bpm, which is a bit higher than my usual of 50 bpm or so.   Approximately 18 hours post vaccination, fever was up to 101.8F.  Took acetaminophen 1000 mg. While trying to rest I experienced palpitations, with a heart rate of 92-95 bpm.  About 20 hours post-vaccination, fever was 101.5F.  Took acetaminophen 500 mg.  3 hours later, fever was down to 99.1F and pulse was down to 74 bpm. On day 3, at 8:15 AM, BP was 106/61, SPO2 was 96%, pulse 71 bpm, and temperature of 99.5F.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the vaccination I begin to feel itching, burning sensation in my left wrist area surrounding the site of the surgery on Jan. 4 for skin cancer.  This increased over the next few hours and by the next morning my lower forearm was involved.  The surgical site was about 2 inches long, stitches had been removed ten days before and the wound was mostly healed.  The rash extended from the wound site toward the wrist about 2 inches, radiated laterally along the length of the wound about 2 inches on either side and up into the upper forearm another 3 inches.  There were small blisters within the rash as well.  I initially tried a cortisone cream I had left over from a previous wound.  This seemed to inflame the rash even more and I stopped.  I then applied some of the antibiotic cream I used when the wound was fresh and actively treated.  This seemed to reduce the inflammation some.  After 2 days I contacted my dermatologist who prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1 % External Cream.  I have been taking this for 24 hours, 3 applications and the rash is beginning to dissipate.  My dermatologist  indicated I was the third patient to have a rash on the same arm with a surgery and a Moderna shot, in the same arm.

                                                Three days after getting my first COVID vaccine I began to develop a red splotch and itchiness on my upper right arm at the site of the injection. It has been two weeks since I received the vaccine and the red splotch has now grown to cover most of my upper right arm on the outside in the shape of a big rectangle,  surrounding the injection site.  It is now 4.5 x 4 inches.  The itchiness has also gotten worse.

                                                My arm was mildly sore at  the injection site for about 36 hours.  2/18/21 (Thurs.) ? In the morning (only) there were rashes on my L arm, my neck and my back. While I have had a few itchy pimple areas for several weeks, and am generally sensitive to everything, this is not the same. It is also not the same as the transient flushing that I have in my face for a few minutes each morning after I take 500 mg. of Niacin.   2/23/21 (Tues.) ? At 8:30 a.m. I had flushing (not quite a noticeable rash) on my back, face, shoulders and both arms, esp. the L arm. (This was 20-30 minutes after I had taken Niacin, but the brief flushing, just in my face, resulting from the Niacin was long gone before these other rashes/flushing occurred.) Later, after 9:00 a.m., there was warmth and itching on my lower back. At 9:45 a.m. I felt flushing in my thighs and lower legs. At 10:00 a.m. there was an actual red rash on my chest and stomach. This all seems unusual for one week after the CoVID-19 shot.     2/27/21 (Sat.) ? Starting at 9:50 a.m. (30 minutes after taking 500 mg. of Niacin, which usually results in immediate flushing of my face, for only a few minutes at most), I had flushing and itching, and a slight rash, on my upper chest and upper back. After a few minutes the flushing and itching spread to my lower back, and my upper arms; my upper arms had a noticeable rash, which then spread down to my hands. In the next few minutes the flushing, itching and rash extended to my upper inner thighs and lower back (although I am only assuming, based on the feeling of flushing and itching, that my lower back had a rash, since I couldn?t see there). Over the next several minutes the itching and rash extended to the front and side of my thighs, down to my knees. The rash then extended, to a lesser extent, down to my ankles. As of 10:50 a.m. I still have this flushing, itching and/or rash in all the places mentioned, although it has started to decrease. This was mostly gone by 12:00 p.m. Other than 4 days ago, I don?t think I have previously experienced this generalized reaction in my 73 years.

                                                In Temporary VAERS E-Report Number 325084, I previously reported whole-body flushing, itching and rashes in the mornings 2 days, 7 days and 11 days after receiving my first Moderna CoVID-19 vaccination on 2/16/21. I now have another incident to report, occurring 16 days after the vaccination.    3/04/21 (Thurs.) ? Starting at 8:20 a.m. (20 minutes after taking 500 mg. of Niacin, which usually results in some immediate flushing of my face, for only a few minutes at most), I had flushing and itching, and a slight rash, on my upper chest. At 8:25 a.m. both arms were red, particularly on the inside of my elbows, as well as my shoulders. At 8:30 .am. my stomach was red and itching. At 8:35 a.m. I had itching and redness on my lower back and inner thighs. (Since I was just adding areas, without the previous areas of flushing, itching and rash going away, going away, my arms were now the reddest of any areas.) At 8:40 a.m. the redness and itching extended to the front of my legs, down to the shin, as well as my lower back. At 8:50 a.m. (by which time I was in a supermarket, without much chance to look at areas under my clothes for redness), the back of my hands were very red, and to a lesser extent my palms. At 9:00 a.m., the overall itching had increased further. At 9:10 a.m., my cheeks and the back of my neck felt flushed and itching. At 9:20 a.m., by which time I was home, my abdomen was very red and itching. At 9:50 a.m., I still had itching all over, esp. my abdomen. By 10:20 a.m. there was a decrease in overall itching and flushing. By 11:20 a.m. they were mostly gone, except for some itching in the small of my back. Today is 16 days after I had my first Moderna vaccination. I have never before experienced this overall reaction to anything, other than 2 days, 7 days and 11 days after the vaccination.

                                                Evening of 3 March 2021 around 7 pm started to feel chills with fever and cold sweets. Left arm beginning to feel very sore at injection site. Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

                                                Awakened from sound sleep in morning of January 6th (~8 days post vaccination) with intense pruritis (itching) of left shoulder and arm (injection site  and bicep region). When I arose in the morning, I noticed a wide (approximately 3-inch  band) of erythema (redness) extending from injection site in left shoulder and extending along outer aspect of bicep to about 2 inches above antecubital fossa (bend of elbow).   I applied roll-on topical anesthetic (4% lidocaine) and 1% hydrocortisone cream, which diminished but did not completely eliminate the itching. Last night, I added OTC Benadryl 25 mg orally, 1 dose. Today, itching is less, but still present. On upper left arm and shoulder the erythema is slightly less, while redness is more intense, but sharply demarcated  at the base of the bicep  (about 1 inch above the elbow crease.    Seems likely this is a delayed allergic reaction. Unless instructed otherwise, will likely not proceed with second dose of vaccine.

                                                My  first vaccine shot  was on 1/11. 10 days after (1/21) a 2 inch red, slightly itchy, warm to the touch rash appeared at injection site. By 1/24, the rash appears less red but has expanded to 3-1/2 to 4 inches.  On 1/21 and 1/22,  I took Allegra (180mg) but as of 1/23, I switched to OTC Benadryl (25 mg 4 times a day) and 1% Hydrocortisone Cream. I have NOT  had, thankfully, any &#34;severe side effects&#34; (like Difficulty Breathing, Swelling, Fast Heartbeat, Dizziness, Weakness or Widespread Rash). Rather my rash appears to be a delayed reaction. I plan to continue with the Benadryl and Hydrocortisone Cream

                                                MY REACTION TO THE FIRST DOSE: In March of 2020 I suffered Covid pneumonia and was on oxygen and too weak and short of breath to work for three months.  It took over seven months to return my breathing and strength to baseline. I just checked my lab and I still have IgG antibodies and a negative nasal screen for the virus. One month ago at 9 AM I received the Moderna Vaccine.  About 12 hours later I developed shaking chills and a fever of about 103, pain in my arm from the injection, and severe cough and a VERY WATERY RUNNY NOSE with severe post nasal drip which caused aspiration of the discharge.   I took Tylenol, Afrin Nasal Spray, and a Dulera inhaler and fell asleep.  I woke up at 3 AM and felt well, but at 4 AM I developed an intolerable intractable cough and severe watery nasal discharge lasting about two hours and severe dry heaves from the aspiration.  Afrin nasal spray helped somewhat but I was absolutely miserable for  two hours.    Three days ago I received the one month booster for the Moderna Vaccine at 10AM.   My arm began to become painful but it was tolerable and not relieved by Tylenol. Every time I rolled over at night the pain woke me up but I was able to tolerate it.  Yesterday I woke up with severe constant chills but my temperature was normal.  I felt very hungry and diaphoretic and felt like I had a low blood sugar,  and ate a bowl of rice chex cereal. I felt a little better but a half hour later VOMITED everything up.  I then felt somewhat better and went to the hospital to make rounds.  The nursing staff reported that about half of them called in sick due to the vaccine with severe fatigue, fever, joint pains and headaches.  One nurse reported that all her joints felt like they were on fire.  Four nursing supervisors also called in sick that day.   I then went to my office and my staff said I looked GREEN and insisted I go home.  I did not eat anything but while resting I again had SEVERE VOMITING of my breakfast at about noon.  When I felt stronger I drove home at about 1:30 PM and fell asleep until about 5 PM, still not having eaten anything nor taking fluids. My arm pain went away.  By 7 PM I finally drank some tea and felt stronger and felt like I was not going to die.   It seems that those of use who had the Covid in the past do not tolerate the vaccine and suffer severe reactions. I was unable to find any studies with the vaccine given to patients who already have antibodies.  This lack of data is a real problem.

I awoke with a bit of swelling, light redness, and a slight itch at the vaccination site.  I understand this is called &#34;COVID arm&#34; and am only reporting it for research purposes.  The swelling has not increased and I have no real pain.  I have no concerns about this reaction.

I am a board crtified family physician. Beginning about 12 hours after the Moderna vaccine, I became fatigued, feverish (99.1) , ached in the thighs and calves, and had a 2-3 hour salty taste triggering thirst. The injection site became very tender but there was no inflammation nor rash.   All symptoms resolved on awakening 9:00 am 1/8/21.

My main concern was that I experienced blood in my urine on the second day after the shot, Thursday, 2/4/21 at 3:30 PM. The blood continued in varying amounts until Friday AM, at which time I did not notice any blood (could still be microscopic).

No muscle ache. After vaccination I lifted weights, stretched arm and took very cold and very warm showers on the area. My theory was dispurse the concentration to avoid the muscle ache. Maybe so. But it may have lead to full body adverse event.  I call it &#34;corona light.&#34;   yesterday I rec&#39;d 015M20A. so far left arm site slightly swollen, aches, small pain with light touch (avoiding any movement of arm). so far so good.

Lasted about a week. I was virtually raised in a barn. For more than a decade, I frequently inhaled the dust of dried manure from numerous bird, bat, and quadruped species. Consequently, my immune system has always been ready for war; I have rarely missed a day of work in my long professional career. I suspect my &#34;COVID arm&#34; represents my normal battle-ready immune system at work.

Severe symptoms lasted about 14 hours.  Lingering tiredness for three days following. I understand some symptoms are to be expected. I am an otherwise healthy, active male. The degree of this was a bit unexpected.

That night I had chills and all my joints were achy, and the next day my hands all broke out in the rash. Saturday I couldn&#39;t get warm, and I couldn&#39;t eat. Monday I couldn&#39;t go in for treatment, and so Tuesday I went to the ER. I had a 100 degree fever. They did some tests. The ER doctor gave me prednisone treatments.

Since this is just day two after developing the rash I have not yet recovered from the reaction.

                                                About 1 day after receiving the first dose of Moderna COVID19 vaccine, pt developed painful erythematous rash over much of L side of torso from sternum around L side to midline posteriorly.  There are some vesicles.  This appears to be about T6-T8 dermatome area. He is also having skin sensitivity in other areas where there is no rash (legs and R side of torso).

                                                On 30 January 2021 at around 5:30 pm my left arm at the injection site started to itch. I had on a long sleeve shirt inside my home. At around 6 pm I went into the bathroom and removed my shirt to apply a minor amount of trade name &#34;Cortizone 10&#34;. As I looked in the mirror I had a red rectangular rash with small raised bumps that was about 3&#34;x4&#34;.  I showed my wife and she took a look and then applied  a small amount of the &#34;Cortizone 10&#34;. The itching stops. I examined my arm again at 10:05 pm and the rash appeared the same. I went on the web-site and for Moderna, this appears not to be an uncommon reaction, not to worry and go ahead with the second vaccine. It is scheduled for 16 February 2021.

I experienced soreness for about 36 hours after the injection but did not consider this to be &#34;pain.&#34; Thus I reported nothing. I&#39;m confident others reported this same experience as &#34;pain.&#34; Your text survey should make a distinction between &#34;pain&#34; and normal &#34;muscle soreness&#34; so that you get consistent results.

Other than that there were no noticeable side effects except that I might have been a little sleepier that than normal.  (Answer to question 20 should be &#34;mostly&#34;.
