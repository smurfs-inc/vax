                                                My son is 16 years of age and was given the Moderna vaccine despite it only being approved for patients over the age of 18. He is experiencing mild fatigue post injection and some soreness at the site. My main concern is the second injection that is scheduled for April 15th at the same location. Should he continue with the course and get the 2nd shot of Moderna? I have been trying to speak to medical center regarding this because not only was his age stated at the appointment and he was found in the medical center system, but he provided id to a woman with the title of director who did not catch it.

                                                This morning I woke up and had a knot at the injection site, along with itchiness. We are 8 days out. I read online that it is considered delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity. I have had zero problems regarding the Moderna vaccine, and this isn?t an issue at all. It is just a small symptom. I figured you guys would be interested in hearing about it. I read that it was more prominent in women and was not that common. I am perfectly fine, like I said.

                                                immediately after receiving his vaccine, he swelled at the injections site. His arm was red. After 10 minutes, he had a red rash around the injection site. After 10 more minutes, injection site was red and rashy, after 10 more minutes, his injection site reaction was mellowing out-no additional redness or swelling. He felt fine each time I asked him-no itching or trouble breathing. After 30 minutes, he left with his mother. I called him at 2:45 pm and he was feeling fine. he said that the rash and swelling were going down but his arm did hurt.

About five to ten minutes to, we were alerted that the patient had fainted. Upon coming to the patient, he was starting to come to but was out of it. I tried asking the patient how he was feeling, is he having a hard time breathing? Patient&#39;s entire arms and legs were bright red with possible rashes that lasted about 5 minutes and went away quick. Patient&#39;s face remained their normal shade. Patient reported he fell asleep and patient&#39;s father reported waking the patient up prior to coming to get his vaccine. Patient sat at the pharmacy to be monitored for an addition 30 minutes before leaving with father. Patient was given water and fan to help cool him down. Patient reported feeling ok after about 10 minutes with legs elevated but was instructed to sit for longer than that time. Patient was ok to leave with father after 30&#43; minutes of monitoring.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No relevant medical history reported.).    On 02-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site). On 04-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FATIGUE (some fatigue). On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia). At the time of the report, DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia) had resolved and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site) and FATIGUE (some fatigue) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. On 03-Apr-2021, patient took Tylenol for the sore arm. On 09-Apr-2021, patient went to his doctor. He got some blood work done. His A1c was fine, his fasting glucose level was fine. Doctor doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s diabetes but had an episode of hypoglycemia. He also did not rule out possible side effect of the vaccine. He has not had another episode since then. Caller is asking if there have been any other reports of hypoglycemic episodes and also asking if Moderna would recommend getting the second dose given the reaction he had with the first dose.   This case was linked  ( Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                On second day after vaccination, Patient began to notice cutaneous lesions on bilateral dorsa of feet and both palms. The dorsa of his feet had a slightly raised, pruritic erythematous rash that, over the course of the day, extended in places near to the ankle. Though not warm to the touch, Patient explained that they felt hot and painful. There was slight swelling. By 1/24/21, there was less swelling, and discomfort and the erythematous rash had become eczematous in places and thicker than the previous day.  The palms didn&#39;t have an appreciable rash. However, Patient felt much discomfort there (not exactly painful) and some paresthesia. He felt that his fingers were swollen. By 1/24/21, the discomfort in both palms was worse.

Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

However, when I received my 2nd shot, I received the Modena manufacturer, and have experienced many concerning side effects. Fever, cold chills, trembling, fatigue, that lasted 2 days after the vaccine was administered. The side effect I am still experiencing is a metallic taste in my mouth, that gets worse when I drink water or other beverages. My hands and fingers turned a rust orange color the day after getting the shot and resolved within 48 hours.

                                                For the first two days a had pain in my left arm but it went away. Around 2pm on that following Sunday (4 days after) I suddenly come down with a fever and headache. I felt so tired, but I took Tylenol and I felt better through the following day. Now, on Tuesday almost a whole week after my shot I get this itching on my chest and arms. Turned out that I got hives, I am not aware of any allergies and I have only broken out into hives one other time in my life and it was 8 years ago and I still do not know the cause. It is now Thursday and the hives have somewhat gone down but I still feel the itchiness around my body. Also to note that the itches are almost about my waist (arms, chest, stomach, back, and neck) I also used the itching cream to relive the itching but I am so tired of the feeling on my body.

                                                Patient reports routinely having spells of syncope with injections and still insisted on receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Gave injection into left deltoid. Had patient scoot up to table in immunization room with both legs fully under the table just in case there was an issue. I set the timer for 15 minutes and left him in the immunization room with his girlfriend, who also received a vaccine. A few moments later the girlfriend asked for our help stating he was feeling like he was going to pass out. I went into the IMZ room and checked with him. At the time, he was sweaty with a rapid hearbeat. I instructed him to take some deep breaths and went to get a cold paper towel to apply to his head. When I returned he had passed out, not responsive but still breathing, in his chair and his girlfriend was holding his head in her hand. We gently lowered his head to rest on the table while another associate called 911 per girlfriend&#39;s request. He began moaning a few moments later and was able to talk to us. He was very hot and sweaty, light headed and breathing rapidly. We applied a cooling pack to his forhead as he continued to lie his head on the table. He then said he might feel more comfortable lying on the floor. We assisted him to the floor, elevated his feet on a chair and placed his head on a roll of paper towels. At that time the paramedics showed up and said his blood pressure was fine and he was just having some hyperventilation. The paramedics got him back up in the chair and his girlfriend got him some apply juice. After about 30 minutes he was talking fine, shaking had stopped and his breathing a temp went back to normal

                                                Patient was seen in my office on 1/15/21 due to a reaction from the  covid. Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

On 2/10/2021; Pt.wrote an email to staff indicating he had received his vaccine on 2/3/2021 and had since been experiencing &#34;sharp stabbing pain&#34; in his shoulder with movement. Pt indicated in his email the pain felt similar to a rotator cuff injury he had obtained to his other shoulder in high school.  Pt. reported he felt like the vaccinator injected the vaccine higher than appropriate which is why he is experiencing pain.  RN called Pt to discuss further. Pt. stated the injection site is a yellow bruised color with swelling above it. Pt. states at times he feels like the pain is getting better but then it always seems to return. Pt. denied fever or other symptoms.RN advised Pt. to call his PCP for evaluation as soon as possible.   Documentation was reviewed. VAMS did not have the vaccinators name in the system accurately. It sited a vaccinator who was not in clinic on 2/3/2021. Upon investigation from paperwork, Pt.card confirmation, and scheduling assignments the vaccinator was identified as Registered Nurse  License # 10.E37725 Exp date: 6/30/2021.

The patient states he was diagnosed with shingles at the left side of dermatomes T11-L3 and was prescribed Valtrex which he was still taking on 3/9/2021. On physical exam that day I observed dry, hyperpigmented pink macules on the left side: 5-10cm clusters just under the umbilicus, hip, lumbar area and buttocks. Gait was normal.

I also experienced some chills. No fever as of yet. Soreness at injection site is moderate.

                                                Our Son is typically a happy person and enjoys everything around him and everyone enjoys him, he usually helps with everything involving his care. He uses an IPAD for communication, he understands most direction given if it is something he has learned. Since receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccination our Son has shown bouts of rage, a rash between his shoulder blades and on his left hip area, both rashes come and go and both rashes are the same type and size. He is typically active; however, the energy level is through the roof, what we mean by through the roof, it is so very extreme that he cannot settle down for anything, he normally sits on our couch and watches a movie but he cannot sit for even 2 minutes without trying to throw himself off the couch.  It is typical for him to sleep through the night, but now he cannot sleep more then 3 or 4 hours and he does not go back to sleep, he cries which is not typical.

                                                I have got a bad rash all over my body, it started slowly just on my right arm and shoulder but then spread to the left shoulder/ arm and has been slowly spreading over my neck, forearms, torso, legs, and today it has spread on my face. It hasn?t been that bad but it itches from time to time, it seems to get worse whenever I shower, and now that it spread to my face I look all messed up. I have used an anti itch cream and some aloe to try and alleviate symptoms but they haven?t stopped the rash from spreading.

                                                I?ve started getting a full body rash. The rash is pretty itchy with some minor swelling but not that bad overall. It?s not at all in my right arm where I got the shot, or in my left arm for that manner. It seems to be nearly entirely concentrated in my stomach region and especially my hands which are somewhat swollen.  This reaction is pretty similar to my Penicillin reaction albeit significantly stronger.

                                                22 yo M w/ no known chronic medical conditions, got COVAX in L delt 1 week ago, now w/ raised/erythematous/itchy rash overlying L delt that started last night. The story sounds c/w localized vaccine reaction, but the area is indurated/warm, so just in case of cellulitis I plan to treat w/ keflex. I do think there is an inflammatory/allergic component, so I also prescribed topical hydrocortisone for itching. Discussed plan/SRP w/ pt in detail. Answered all questions. Pt verbalized understanding, agreed to plan/SRP, and pt was d/c&#39;ed in stable condition.

All those lasted about 4 days. They really bad ?COVID toes? that were like chlybains and now 3 weeks later look like petechiae on top of toes (reddish - purple , a few are bleeding). By the way I had Mono 13 months ago that was pretty bad and had COVID in November not that severe at all.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

I was alerted and I helped him into the vaccination room to lay down on the floor with his feet propped up. His girlfriend was there to help calm him down. I offered to call 911, he refused. I grabbed a fan for him, and turned it off when he requested. He then began shivering rather uncontrollably and said his left arm (injection site) was hurting and tingling, and at one point, said his right arm was beginning to tingle as well.  We had him breath and relax, he began to return to normal and he and girlfriend discussed how he must be partly having an anxiety/panic attack. He trialed standing up a few times until he felt good enough to leave the room, all in all about 20 minutes. He sat close by for additional 15 minutes of observation, at which point he left stating he felt more like himself.

                                                I received the vaccine through my employer.  7 Days after the vaccination event, my left deltoid muscle became significantly swollen, stiff and tender. There was pain when I tried to elevate the arm laterally. The site was very warm to the touch. I experienced periods of malaise and fatigue at random intervals throughout the week after which I received the vaccine. On day 8, a red rash began to appear on the vaccination site. It was slightly itchy. The area was still stiff and swollen, and painful to move past a certain angle. This night I felt especially fatigued. On day 9 I woke up to see the swelling was mostly subsided, however the rash had spread down the arm to roughly the elbow. The site was no longer warm. It was still slightly irritable. As the day is progressing (this is written on day 9), the rash is starting to fade.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

Went to walk-in, provider recommended Claritin and Pepcid daily. I&#39;ve taken those for three days now with the occasional Benadryl and haven&#39;t noticed any hives. Hives varied in size and location. Ultimately in all different areas of my body at one point of another. I have pictures if needed.

                                                Woke up with a headache and fatigue, as well as soreness near area of injection. Energy was very low and felt very tired. Tried to sleep at around 12:00 PM but had a thumping in my head that would not let me fall asleep. Around 3:00 PM tried to sleep again but being shivering/shaking a lot despite being under a blanket and comforter. Eventually needed to take a hot bath for around 45 minutes to an hour. Took my temperature while in the bath which read 96°F (although that thermometer may not be the most accurate.) After the bath I went directly to bed with a comforter, blanket and weighted blanket and was able to fall asleep for about 90 minutes. Was no longer shivering when I awoke and felt much better. Went to sleep at around 9:00 PM and felt fine when I woke up the next morning.

                                                Nothing at time of injection. In the evening, soreness in the arm (strong but on par for what I would expect).   Next morning, I starting feeling sick, with flu symptoms. Aching muscles, sensitive skin, mild headache, sore eyes, and in the evening, nausea. Temperature gradually rose. ~99.7 at 6pm, 100.1 at 7pm, 100.7 at 8pm, 101.7 at 9:30pm. I took some Tylenol around 7pm, and then some theraflu at 10pm.   Fell asleep at 11pm. Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.   Feeling much better in the morning on March 4th. Temperature was 99.9, then rose to 100.0 at 11am. Now, at 3pm, feeling fatigue, exhaustion. No headache. Normal sense of taste and smell. No couch.  Taking another day off from work. Temperature is currently 100.0. Taking more theraflu now, have not taken Tylenol today.

This worsening throughout the day, and around 5:30pm that day I began to experience some cold-like symptoms (fatigue, soreness, chills). This continued into Sunday, and it tapered off until I felt relatively normal around 4pm.   I only treated this with some generic Nyquil.

By 15 hours post vaccination a mild headache and low fever of 100.8 developed. Treatment included diphenhydramine to ease antihistamine response and aspirin to lower fever and reduce severity of headache.

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

A large portion of patients deltoid around administration site continues to be swollen and red 3 days following administration. The patient hasn&#39;t noticed the area getting any larger and is going to continue to monitor for any worsening symptoms. Patient was advised to seek medical care if symptoms worsened.

                                                Waking up the day after my vaccination, my right arm was so sore I could barely lift it over my head. I also had minor chills and fever but that cleared up after I took acetaminophen. By Friday (two days after my vaccination) the soreness had reduced but I had developed a 4&#34; x 3&#34; rash around the injection site. It was both itchy and slightly painful, but not enough that I felt the need to take a painkiller. Today (five days after my vaccination) it has finally receded away.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/15/21. I had soreness in my left arm after receiving the vaccine and it continued for a few days. I also had redness and swelling near the injection site, but it was very small. On 1/22/21, the redness and swelling became more moderate than mild and was very itchy. It also had bumps inside the rash margins. After it started to expand more on 1/23/21, I decided to go to urgent care the next day, Sunday 1/24/21. The NP reported that it was an allergic reaction, but it was very localized and didn&#39;t include any other organs. I was prescribed Prednisone and was to take it for the next five days. I will be starting the medication today.

                                                The day following my first COVID vaccination, I had pain in my upper arm for 36 hours and could not lift it above my shoulder. I also experienced 6 hours of constant chills throughout my body, which came on suddenly around 1PM (24 hours after my vaccination) and was sent home early from work. During the 6 hours at home I believe I experienced body chills, I experienced what I believe to be brain fog. My coworkers described my motor skills (walking down a hallway) as slow and lethargic, and my thoughts being delayed. I do not consciously remember the 6 hour timeframe when I experienced these symptoms. Around 7PM that evening, I remember having a &#34;coming to&#34; moment where I remember the chills subsiding, and being able to think again.  The following day I felt back to normal other than pain at the injection site.

Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.

It was bad enough to halt daily activities (I canceled a phd interview because of how bad I felt).  This occurred from late 2/4 through morning of 2/6. Taking tylenol seemed to help and I felt immensely better the two or three times my fever broke.

After seven hours, I began experiencing body aches, and before I went to bed around 9PM I was experiencing chills. Throughout the night I had a fever. When I woke up at 9:30AM the next day, I had a headache and slight body aches. I took some Tylenol and felt better at about 12PM that same day.

                                                Had a sore left arm where the injection site was, after about an hour later i began to have a mild headache and became tired (i took 2 aleve liquid gel pain killers and that didn&#39;t do much). The next day the pain in my arm got about 50% better, and the head ache was gone right when I woke up. I still felt tired throughout the 2nd day and my left under eye lid began to start twitching for about a minute long every 30 minutes. On the 3rd day, I was no longer tired and my arm no longer hurt but the under eye lid twitch is still occurring and at the same frequency.

                                                Patient had a rash develop after the soreness in his arm went away (he approximated 3 days) after vaccine on his left arm.  It is red, round about 2 and 1/2 to 3 inches in size, occasionally itchy.  It is still present 9 days after it showed up.  Has no other symptoms.  Patient is going to take some benadryl to see if it will help with the local reaction and itching.  If it does not resolve he is going to schedule a visit with his PCP.  On his way to a health care coach visit.  I urged him to mention it to them and am also going to contact his PCP for him.
