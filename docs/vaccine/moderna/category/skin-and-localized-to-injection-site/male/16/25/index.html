                                                My son is 16 years of age and was given the Moderna vaccine despite it only being approved for patients over the age of 18. He is experiencing mild fatigue post injection and some soreness at the site. My main concern is the second injection that is scheduled for April 15th at the same location. Should he continue with the course and get the 2nd shot of Moderna? I have been trying to speak to medical center regarding this because not only was his age stated at the appointment and he was found in the medical center system, but he provided id to a woman with the title of director who did not catch it.

                                                This morning I woke up and had a knot at the injection site, along with itchiness. We are 8 days out. I read online that it is considered delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity. I have had zero problems regarding the Moderna vaccine, and this isn?t an issue at all. It is just a small symptom. I figured you guys would be interested in hearing about it. I read that it was more prominent in women and was not that common. I am perfectly fine, like I said.

After 10 minutes, he had a red rash around the injection site. After 10 more minutes, injection site was red and rashy, after 10 more minutes, his injection site reaction was mellowing out-no additional redness or swelling. He felt fine each time I asked him-no itching or trouble breathing. After 30 minutes, he left with his mother. I called him at 2:45 pm and he was feeling fine. he said that the rash and swelling were going down but his arm did hurt.

About five to ten minutes to, we were alerted that the patient had fainted. Upon coming to the patient, he was starting to come to but was out of it. I tried asking the patient how he was feeling, is he having a hard time breathing? Patient&#39;s entire arms and legs were bright red with possible rashes that lasted about 5 minutes and went away quick. Patient&#39;s face remained their normal shade. Patient reported he fell asleep and patient&#39;s father reported waking the patient up prior to coming to get his vaccine. Patient sat at the pharmacy to be monitored for an addition 30 minutes before leaving with father. Patient was given water and fan to help cool him down. Patient reported feeling ok after about 10 minutes with legs elevated but was instructed to sit for longer than that time. Patient was ok to leave with father after 30&#43; minutes of monitoring.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No relevant medical history reported.).    On 02-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site). On 04-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FATIGUE (some fatigue). On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia). At the time of the report, DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia) had resolved and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site) and FATIGUE (some fatigue) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. On 03-Apr-2021, patient took Tylenol for the sore arm. On 09-Apr-2021, patient went to his doctor. He got some blood work done. His A1c was fine, his fasting glucose level was fine. Doctor doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s diabetes but had an episode of hypoglycemia. He also did not rule out possible side effect of the vaccine. He has not had another episode since then. Caller is asking if there have been any other reports of hypoglycemic episodes and also asking if Moderna would recommend getting the second dose given the reaction he had with the first dose.   This case was linked  ( Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                On second day after vaccination, Patient began to notice cutaneous lesions on bilateral dorsa of feet and both palms. The dorsa of his feet had a slightly raised, pruritic erythematous rash that, over the course of the day, extended in places near to the ankle. Though not warm to the touch, Patient explained that they felt hot and painful. There was slight swelling. By 1/24/21, there was less swelling, and discomfort and the erythematous rash had become eczematous in places and thicker than the previous day.  The palms didn&#39;t have an appreciable rash. However, Patient felt much discomfort there (not exactly painful) and some paresthesia. He felt that his fingers were swollen. By 1/24/21, the discomfort in both palms was worse.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine was administered I experienced the usual side effects of mild headache, fatigue and localized redness and swelling  Around 11pm the night the vaccine was administered I developed a migraine that resulted in blurred vision. and when I checked my temperature it was approximately 104.9 degrees Fahrenheit.By the next morning, approximately 7am, I was weak to the point I could not get out of bed myself, I was nauseous that resulted in a single Emesis episode approximately 8am, I had mild swelling of my face since 7am, between 7:30am and 12pm, I had multiple times where I would temporarily lose my vision. Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

However, when I received my 2nd shot, I received the Modena manufacturer, and have experienced many concerning side effects. Fever, cold chills, trembling, fatigue, that lasted 2 days after the vaccine was administered. The side effect I am still experiencing is a metallic taste in my mouth, that gets worse when I drink water or other beverages. My hands and fingers turned a rust orange color the day after getting the shot and resolved within 48 hours.

                                                Developed &#34;moderna arm&#34; (raised inflammation with itching 1.5-2 inches long and 0.5-1 inches across) 7 days post vaccination from injection 1.   Developed somewhat severe tension headache on day 1 post vaccination from injection 2 (all further events listed below are from injection 2). Headache responded to ibuprofen.  On day 4 post vaccination, began experiencing minor and infrequent migraine-like headaches that lasted for a few seconds to a minute. Moderate pain and localized. Pain site changed but was generally on left side. Experienced 0-2 a day until day 12.  On day 11 post vaccination, began experiencing full, moderate tension headache. In addition, had more frequent migraine-like headaches. Did not respond to 400mg ibuprofen or 10mg Claritin.  On day 12 post vaccination, began experiencing photophobia. Mentioned to general practitioner out of an abundance of caution who recommended Excedrin. Took two Excedrin extra strength (total dosage: Acetomenaphin 500mg, Aspirin 500 mg, Caffeine 130 mg). Tension headache ended and most (but not all) migraine-like pain subsided. Some occasional pain ranging from 1-2 out of 10.  On day 13 out of an abundance of caution following reports of other events I went to the ER. The doctor there examined for any cognitive symptoms (asked me to follow her finger with my eyes, squeeze fingers, checked ability to move extremities, etc) and concluded no risk of CVST. Determined that vaccine likely lowered my threshold for headaches and migraines (I have had very infrequent cluster headaches lasting for a few seconds in the past, never for this duration). Final diagnosis was migraines. Doctor prescribed Fioricet and gave me a long-acting steroid. Some pain is still there, but symptoms have mostly stopped. Waves of quick bursts of pain on localized areas on the left side of my head are still occuring.

                                                For the first two days a had pain in my left arm but it went away. Around 2pm on that following Sunday (4 days after) I suddenly come down with a fever and headache. I felt so tired, but I took Tylenol and I felt better through the following day. Now, on Tuesday almost a whole week after my shot I get this itching on my chest and arms. Turned out that I got hives, I am not aware of any allergies and I have only broken out into hives one other time in my life and it was 8 years ago and I still do not know the cause. It is now Thursday and the hives have somewhat gone down but I still feel the itchiness around my body. Also to note that the itches are almost about my waist (arms, chest, stomach, back, and neck) I also used the itching cream to relive the itching but I am so tired of the feeling on my body.

                                                Patient reports routinely having spells of syncope with injections and still insisted on receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Gave injection into left deltoid. Had patient scoot up to table in immunization room with both legs fully under the table just in case there was an issue. I set the timer for 15 minutes and left him in the immunization room with his girlfriend, who also received a vaccine. A few moments later the girlfriend asked for our help stating he was feeling like he was going to pass out. I went into the IMZ room and checked with him. At the time, he was sweaty with a rapid hearbeat. I instructed him to take some deep breaths and went to get a cold paper towel to apply to his head. When I returned he had passed out, not responsive but still breathing, in his chair and his girlfriend was holding his head in her hand. We gently lowered his head to rest on the table while another associate called 911 per girlfriend&#39;s request. He began moaning a few moments later and was able to talk to us. He was very hot and sweaty, light headed and breathing rapidly. We applied a cooling pack to his forhead as he continued to lie his head on the table. He then said he might feel more comfortable lying on the floor. We assisted him to the floor, elevated his feet on a chair and placed his head on a roll of paper towels. At that time the paramedics showed up and said his blood pressure was fine and he was just having some hyperventilation. The paramedics got him back up in the chair and his girlfriend got him some apply juice. After about 30 minutes he was talking fine, shaking had stopped and his breathing a temp went back to normal

When I brought the water to him he was very pale and said he felt like fainting.  We had him lay down and elevate feet which helped him feel better but was still hot so I applied a cold ice pack on head to help him feel less hot.  After about 10-15 minutes he felt better and stayed with us for about 45 mintues until he felt well enough to drive home.  I checked on him about 2 hours later and he was feeling much better.

The morning of 5/15/21 the patient awoke with a pruritic rash on the trunk, which spread to the upper and lower extremities, and face. Patient went to emergency room and was given oral Benadryl x1, oral Prednisone 40mg x1, and sent home the same day with a topical steroid cream. Seen again at my office on 5/28/21. Rash had mostly resolved, but pruritic rash still present on lower back and buttocks. Rash has resulted in small open wounds due to scratching, with surrounding cellulitis. Currently treating with 7-day course of Bactrim for cellulitis. No evidence of anaphylaxis.

Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

On 2/10/2021; Pt.wrote an email to staff indicating he had received his vaccine on 2/3/2021 and had since been experiencing &#34;sharp stabbing pain&#34; in his shoulder with movement. Pt indicated in his email the pain felt similar to a rotator cuff injury he had obtained to his other shoulder in high school.  Pt. reported he felt like the vaccinator injected the vaccine higher than appropriate which is why he is experiencing pain.  RN called Pt to discuss further. Pt. stated the injection site is a yellow bruised color with swelling above it. Pt. states at times he feels like the pain is getting better but then it always seems to return. Pt. denied fever or other symptoms.RN advised Pt. to call his PCP for evaluation as soon as possible.   Documentation was reviewed. VAMS did not have the vaccinators name in the system accurately. It sited a vaccinator who was not in clinic on 2/3/2021. Upon investigation from paperwork, Pt.card confirmation, and scheduling assignments the vaccinator was identified as Registered Nurse  License # 10.E37725 Exp date: 6/30/2021.

This subsided after a short while (within 15) minutes after I left the vaccine location. I arrived home and felt fatigue and a  slight headache develop.  The headache has since stopped. I also experienced some chills. No fever as of yet. Soreness at injection site is moderate.

                                                Our Son is typically a happy person and enjoys everything around him and everyone enjoys him, he usually helps with everything involving his care. He uses an IPAD for communication, he understands most direction given if it is something he has learned. Since receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccination our Son has shown bouts of rage, a rash between his shoulder blades and on his left hip area, both rashes come and go and both rashes are the same type and size. He is typically active; however, the energy level is through the roof, what we mean by through the roof, it is so very extreme that he cannot settle down for anything, he normally sits on our couch and watches a movie but he cannot sit for even 2 minutes without trying to throw himself off the couch.  It is typical for him to sleep through the night, but now he cannot sleep more then 3 or 4 hours and he does not go back to sleep, he cries which is not typical.

                                                I have got a bad rash all over my body, it started slowly just on my right arm and shoulder but then spread to the left shoulder/ arm and has been slowly spreading over my neck, forearms, torso, legs, and today it has spread on my face. It hasn?t been that bad but it itches from time to time, it seems to get worse whenever I shower, and now that it spread to my face I look all messed up. I have used an anti itch cream and some aloe to try and alleviate symptoms but they haven?t stopped the rash from spreading.

                                                I?ve started getting a full body rash. The rash is pretty itchy with some minor swelling but not that bad overall. It?s not at all in my right arm where I got the shot, or in my left arm for that manner. It seems to be nearly entirely concentrated in my stomach region and especially my hands which are somewhat swollen.  This reaction is pretty similar to my Penicillin reaction albeit significantly stronger.

The herald patch of pityriasis rosea appears 1-20 days before the rash, and I don&#39;t know when it appeared since it was not itchy and on my back, but I did have some mild symptoms such as a mild sore throat that can be early signs of this disease.

By the way I had Mono 13 months ago that was pretty bad and had COVID in November not that severe at all.

The story sounds c/w localized vaccine reaction, but the area is indurated/warm, so just in case of cellulitis I plan to treat w/ keflex. I do think there is an inflammatory/allergic component, so I also prescribed topical hydrocortisone for itching. Discussed plan/SRP w/ pt in detail. Answered all questions. Pt verbalized understanding, agreed to plan/SRP, and pt was d/c&#39;ed in stable condition.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

                                                Around 3 pm on 4/14/21, I started to feel very tired and I started to get a headache. Around 6 pm, I started to experience lower back pain and my legs began to throb and my whole body became very sensitive to touch. I took tylenol or ibuprofen every 4 hours for the rest of the night. This went on until Thursday 4/15/21, when the dizziness and throbbing headache started. Every time I would stand up I would become off balanced and need to hold on to something. I was still experiencing the lower back pain, leg throbbing and skin sensitivity but the dizziness and headache became much more intense. Around 9:30  pm on Thursday, I felt like I was hallucinating and was experiencing euphoria along with a fever. I did not sleep the night of 4/15 into 4/16. I was sweating profusely with a throbbing headache that would cause spinning when I would stand up. Around 3 am on 4/16, I fell asleep until around 4:30 am when I woke up in a pool of my own sweat. The body aches, leg pain and skin sensitivity went away along with my fever. Throughout Friday 4/16, I had a throbbing headache and was dizzy with no relief. This continued into Sunday 4/18 when I started to feel some relief. My headache was pretty much gone but the dizziness is still very much there. I have also an experienced elevated heart rate and respirations throughout the last 5 days.

                                                Pt felt nauseous, hot, started getting red, and sat down on floor about 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I was alerted and I helped him into the vaccination room to lay down on the floor with his feet propped up. His girlfriend was there to help calm him down. I offered to call 911, he refused. I grabbed a fan for him, and turned it off when he requested. He then began shivering rather uncontrollably and said his left arm (injection site) was hurting and tingling, and at one point, said his right arm was beginning to tingle as well.  We had him breath and relax, he began to return to normal and he and girlfriend discussed how he must be partly having an anxiety/panic attack. He trialed standing up a few times until he felt good enough to leave the room, all in all about 20 minutes. He sat close by for additional 15 minutes of observation, at which point he left stating he felt more like himself.

Recorded temperature of 100.7 degrees with an ear thermometer. Took Tylenol, drank 32oz of cold water, put a cold wash cloth on forehead. After an hour my temperature dropped to 98.8. Felt less achy but still warm.

                                                I received the vaccine through my employer.  7 Days after the vaccination event, my left deltoid muscle became significantly swollen, stiff and tender. There was pain when I tried to elevate the arm laterally. The site was very warm to the touch. I experienced periods of malaise and fatigue at random intervals throughout the week after which I received the vaccine. On day 8, a red rash began to appear on the vaccination site. It was slightly itchy. The area was still stiff and swollen, and painful to move past a certain angle. This night I felt especially fatigued. On day 9 I woke up to see the swelling was mostly subsided, however the rash had spread down the arm to roughly the elbow. The site was no longer warm. It was still slightly irritable. As the day is progressing (this is written on day 9), the rash is starting to fade.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

Hives varied in size and location. Ultimately in all different areas of my body at one point of another. I have pictures if needed.

Just there and really red after shower for example.  Notice it when I work out as well.  It is more red when I am working out.  The shot was injected on my left arm.

                                                Woke up with a headache and fatigue, as well as soreness near area of injection. Energy was very low and felt very tired. Tried to sleep at around 12:00 PM but had a thumping in my head that would not let me fall asleep. Around 3:00 PM tried to sleep again but being shivering/shaking a lot despite being under a blanket and comforter. Eventually needed to take a hot bath for around 45 minutes to an hour. Took my temperature while in the bath which read 96°F (although that thermometer may not be the most accurate.) After the bath I went directly to bed with a comforter, blanket and weighted blanket and was able to fall asleep for about 90 minutes. Was no longer shivering when I awoke and felt much better. Went to sleep at around 9:00 PM and felt fine when I woke up the next morning.

The next day I noticed that it had spread a bit to my back. As of right now, 2/12/21, it has lightened to a more pink color. It doesn&#39;t hurt, at most it itches but otherwise I don&#39;t really notice it.

                                                Nothing at time of injection. In the evening, soreness in the arm (strong but on par for what I would expect).   Next morning, I starting feeling sick, with flu symptoms. Aching muscles, sensitive skin, mild headache, sore eyes, and in the evening, nausea. Temperature gradually rose. ~99.7 at 6pm, 100.1 at 7pm, 100.7 at 8pm, 101.7 at 9:30pm. I took some Tylenol around 7pm, and then some theraflu at 10pm.   Fell asleep at 11pm. Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.   Feeling much better in the morning on March 4th. Temperature was 99.9, then rose to 100.0 at 11am. Now, at 3pm, feeling fatigue, exhaustion. No headache. Normal sense of taste and smell. No couch.  Taking another day off from work. Temperature is currently 100.0. Taking more theraflu now, have not taken Tylenol today.

This worsening throughout the day, and around 5:30pm that day I began to experience some cold-like symptoms (fatigue, soreness, chills). This continued into Sunday, and it tapered off until I felt relatively normal around 4pm.   I only treated this with some generic Nyquil.

Approximately 1 minute after it began to itch I got very hot and nauseous, approximately 30 seconds later I was unconscious and beginning to seize. I was unconscious for about 1 minute. When I awoke I couldn?t see anything, my entire body was numb and in pain. I couldn?t move my fingers. I was rushed to the ER but by the time I was seen I was fully coherent and fine.

                                                Starting about 10 hours after receiving the second Modern vaccination I experienced a minor headache and drowsiness, which continued until about 30 hours after the vaccination. These symptoms resolved without treatment. Around 20 hours after the vaccination an itchy rash developed on the lower lip, around the left eye, and in the genital area (including: penis, testicles, and upper inner thigh). Rash continued to get worse until about 4 days after the vaccination. At this point I sought treatment at a local urgent care. The urgent care personnel said they believed the rash symptoms were caused by the Modern COVID-19 vaccination, did not identify any other possible causes, and encouraged me to report it to the VAERS system. The treatment followed was topical 1% hydrocortisone cream applied to the affected areas, and 12.5 mg of diphenhydramine taken orally before bed. The rash symptoms improved with treatment but have not fully resolved at 5 days after the vaccination.

He stated that he had taken one Claritin 10mg tablet earlier in the day. I recommended taking some Benadryl and the patient agreed. I gave him 4 teaspoonsful of Benadryl Elixir (50mg). I ask the patient to remain in the waiting area for  30 minutes or so and afterwards to let me know how he was doing. He didn&#39;t return to the pharmacy counter and was gone before a could speak to him. I called his mobile number and left him a detailed message and to call me if he had any further concerns. I didn&#39;t hear back from the patient.

By 15 hours post vaccination a mild headache and low fever of 100.8 developed. Treatment included diphenhydramine to ease antihistamine response and aspirin to lower fever and reduce severity of headache.

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

A large portion of patients deltoid around administration site continues to be swollen and red 3 days following administration. The patient hasn&#39;t noticed the area getting any larger and is going to continue to monitor for any worsening symptoms. Patient was advised to seek medical care if symptoms worsened.

                                                Waking up the day after my vaccination, my right arm was so sore I could barely lift it over my head. I also had minor chills and fever but that cleared up after I took acetaminophen. By Friday (two days after my vaccination) the soreness had reduced but I had developed a 4&#34; x 3&#34; rash around the injection site. It was both itchy and slightly painful, but not enough that I felt the need to take a painkiller. Today (five days after my vaccination) it has finally receded away.

                                                Developed a skin rash that was localized to the back side of my arms. Since then the rash has worsened severely and spread to my neck, torso, and back. I have seemed medical care multiple times. Been given 2 different steroid creams, 3 different antibiotics. The most recent visit (2 days ago) I was given Pepcid and Zyrtec. At this point I cannot sleep due to the heat and pain coming from the sites of the rash and need something to resolve it

                                                on 5/20/21 I noticed 3 yellow spots on my chest that look like bruises but didn&#39;t hurt to touch. Now on 5/24/21 I have another yellow spot right under my right eye and the 3 on my chest are still there. I dont technically now if it is the vaccine that caused this but it did happen right after i took it.

The bumpy painful rash appeared on my cheek in a perfect triangle that resembled a shingles rash. I also had very itchy painful bumps on my forehead, chin, ears, neck, in between fingers, and all over my privates. Was tested for both shingles and herpes and both came back negative. Was put on steroids by doctor and rash has gotten  better but has yet to disappear. I am still sick from when I got the shot and am dealing with a feeling that feels like my whole body is bruised and painful to the touch. Rash and bumps are unknown by doctors and the one on my fingers appears to be spreading on my fingers.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/15/21. I had soreness in my left arm after receiving the vaccine and it continued for a few days. I also had redness and swelling near the injection site, but it was very small. On 1/22/21, the redness and swelling became more moderate than mild and was very itchy. It also had bumps inside the rash margins. After it started to expand more on 1/23/21, I decided to go to urgent care the next day, Sunday 1/24/21. The NP reported that it was an allergic reaction, but it was very localized and didn&#39;t include any other organs. I was prescribed Prednisone and was to take it for the next five days. I will be starting the medication today.

                                                The day following my first COVID vaccination, I had pain in my upper arm for 36 hours and could not lift it above my shoulder. I also experienced 6 hours of constant chills throughout my body, which came on suddenly around 1PM (24 hours after my vaccination) and was sent home early from work. During the 6 hours at home I believe I experienced body chills, I experienced what I believe to be brain fog. My coworkers described my motor skills (walking down a hallway) as slow and lethargic, and my thoughts being delayed. I do not consciously remember the 6 hour timeframe when I experienced these symptoms. Around 7PM that evening, I remember having a &#34;coming to&#34; moment where I remember the chills subsiding, and being able to think again.  The following day I felt back to normal other than pain at the injection site.

Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.

Taking tylenol seemed to help and I felt immensely better the two or three times my fever broke.

                                                Began scratching itchy arms and torso around midnight. Itchiness gradually became more unbearable and widespread to whole body over an hour, and face became warm and filled with rashes. Went to the bathroom and noticed hives and redness all over body. Took Benedryl and took a warm shower and symptoms wore off after approx. 1 hour.

                                                Had a sore left arm where the injection site was, after about an hour later i began to have a mild headache and became tired (i took 2 aleve liquid gel pain killers and that didn&#39;t do much). The next day the pain in my arm got about 50% better, and the head ache was gone right when I woke up. I still felt tired throughout the 2nd day and my left under eye lid began to start twitching for about a minute long every 30 minutes. On the 3rd day, I was no longer tired and my arm no longer hurt but the under eye lid twitch is still occurring and at the same frequency.

It is red, round about 2 and 1/2 to 3 inches in size, occasionally itchy.  It is still present 9 days after it showed up.  Has no other symptoms.  Patient is going to take some benadryl to see if it will help with the local reaction and itching.  If it does not resolve he is going to schedule a visit with his PCP.  On his way to a health care coach visit.  I urged him to mention it to them and am also going to contact his PCP for him.

Next morning around 10am, I woke up with hives on my left and right forearm/elbow area, and on my left and right knee area. No other symptoms besides the sore left arm. I took one anti-histamine pill (diphenhydramine hcl 25mg) every 6 hours, and applied cortizone (hydrocortizone) on the areas mentioned every 6 hours as well. It helps, but it comes back every 6 hours. I am worried if it will affect my status on getting the second dose of the COVID Vaccine. I also had almonds, but I never had a history on allergies related to nuts, dairy, and bread.

                                                I started experiencing mild soreness around the injection site on the arm the next day after the shot and it lasted for a total of 2 days( which is very normal) . Then almost after a week I noticed a resurgence of very mild (weaker than the first time) soreness which lasted for one day and then disappeared again. As of now, I do not feel any soreness of pain. I am reporting this only because I felt it might add to the existing corpus of knowledge we have about the side-effects of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                I was poked twice, the vaccine was administered on the second poke. After the first time he put the needle into my shoulder, he said that he &#34;hit something hard&#34; and didn&#39;t &#34;want to just stab through it.&#34; He immediately poked me again and gave me the vaccine. Both pokes were much higher than usual. The morning after I had received the vaccine, my arm was in excruciating pain and my range of motion was almost nonexistent. I expected this side effect, but I did not expect it to last this long. It has been 3 days and my arm is still nearly immobile and testing the mobility is very painful. I haven&#39;t taken any medication since the adverse event. I visited an urgent care facility today and was told to fill out this form during the consultation.

Was under the impression it was a spider bite, but over time I am concerned it could&#39;ve been shingles.  I have had shingles before in the exact same location as these bumps, which makes me skeptical it was a spider bite. The bumps occurred approximately 4 days after my 1st shot. Bumps are nearly healed now and I did not seek medical treatment.

On admission patient was found to have a platelet count of 1. Heme/ onc was consulted and thrombocytopenia was deemed secondary to ITP.  Hepatitis B panel, showed previous hepatitis B infection, although results may be inaccurate due to patient receiving IVIG prior to hepatitis panel being done.  Patient also had an equivocal syphilis result, which also could be a false positive due to immune response.  Patient received 2 IVIG, 4 days of Decadron, and 1 dose of Nplate.  Patient did not receive rituximab, due to stable increasing platelet count.  Patient received hepatitis-B prophylaxis for 2 days in case he were to receive rituximab.  Platelet count now stable at 25, to follow-up with hematology in 1 week outpatient for repeat CBC.  Patient also to follow-up with his Primary Care Physician in 1 week.
