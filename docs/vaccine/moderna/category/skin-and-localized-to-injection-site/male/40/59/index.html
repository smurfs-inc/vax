                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

On 1/12/21 I experienced SOB/labored breathing for approximately 24 hours. O2 sat did not go below 95%. HR was between 80 and 105 for approximately four hours (75 is a typical resting heart rate). No history of asthma, but I felt how people with asthma describe difficulty breathing. Given the length of time between the dose and the SOB, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the vaccine. But I am submitting this just in case you end up with other, similar reports. Thank you.

                                                The shot was administered in my left arm.  I experienced localized swelling and axillary lymph node tenderness immediately after injection under my left armpit.  The right side of my face also became numb for about 5 minutes.  The next morning the areas around my eyes were swollen and I had two styes in my right eye.  I do not know if these were related.  These symptoms lasted approximately 3 days.  Some minimal swelling and tenderness seemed to remain, and approximately a week later I experienced a painful resurgence of the swelling at the injection site that was far larger, harder and more painful.  I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen.  These relieved the symptoms within 48 hours.

                                                Initially, no immediate problems other than slightly tender at injection site. Approximately 48 hours later (evening 01/14/2021) started to notice increased inflammation about the size of a &#34;quarter&#34; on left side of chin. I did have a pimple/ingrown hair at this site prior to the injection which was mostly healed but not entirely healed. The next morning, 01/15/2021, I experience mild facial numbness to the left side of my chin and mild facial paralysis resulting in an asymmetrical smile, and mild swelling to the left side of my face. Two day later (morning 01/17/2021) with my symptoms not worsening but showing only a little improvement, I went to my local urgent care for evaluation. Provider was not 100% sure of the diagnosis but felt this could be a case of shingles or folliculitis. I was treated with a 7 day course of acyclovir and a 10 day course of doxycycline hyclate. The numbness subsided 2-3 days after treatment began. The facial paralysis and swelling showed much improvement (90-95%) after completing the acyclovir on 01/24/2021; however, I feel there is still a little more improvement to go.

Then one week later on 1/26/2021 I started having vaccine shoulder itchiness I didn&#39;t think anything of it and then my arm swelled and got hot. The next day on 1/27/2021 it had a red area around it and was hot. I have never had a fever or anything else except minor pain the day after the vaccine.  I continued ibuprofen and benadryl at night it took the itch away and was bearable. I want to know if I should get the second shot? I have it scheduled for 2-15-2021 @ 2:00 pm PST I also have pictures

                                                Tenderness at the site of injection, fever, chills, and headache.  All signs and symptoms started about 6 hours after receiving vaccine and lasted about 18 hours.  Felt back to baseline after 36 hours.  Took ibuprophen 400 mg  (morning of the 2/3 and evening of 2/3) for headache with relief and took Nyquil (night of 2/2) for chills and to help sleep with minimal relief.  Symptoms were sever enough that I donot feel like I would have been able to go to work that day.

                                                Beginning approximately one day after shot administration, I developed a red lesion at the injection site around 2 inches in diameter.  Around day 5, this went away.  Then, around day 8, the lesion returned, and is now about 3 inches in diameter. Both times, the lesion was red, itchy, burning, and painful to touch.  The lesion appears to be consistent with reports of &#34;COVID Arm&#34; seen in some instances after receiving the Moderna shot specifically.

                                                It has been 6 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. For the first 3-4 days I had the usual moderate flu-like symptoms:  dizziness, headaches, fatigue, chills, soreness at vaccine siteetc.  Days 5-7 I seemed to gradually improve. On day 8 all of the symptoms returned with greater severity: this time I had a fever, the chills were much more intense, the headaches were excruciating, body and joint aches all over the place--I couldn&#39;t sleep or focus on anything cognitively taxing.  Interestingly, my brother, who was vaccinated just after me, also had more severe side effects beginning on day 8 post 2nd dose. He improved after 3-4 days, but my recovery has been much much lengthier. By day 14 I was still feeling very ill, though the fever did subside.  Sometime in the third week the pain in my arm at the vaccination site returned, then became intermittent, and still bothers me from time to time. I also started getting muscle spasms in the same exact locations that sent me to the ER after my probably bout with Covid in the spring of 2020. Thankfully these lasted only a week or so, though I began feeling muscle soreness in different parts of my body, ever changing. By the 4th week I was slightly better and down to 4 main symptoms: chills (by far the worst of the symptoms--to the point at which my skin would feel like it was being frostbitten by dry ice every time I changed sweaty clothes), occasional splitting headaches, and muscle soreness that included both the injection site on my arm and other areas.  I had other symptoms as well, fatigue and brain fog, etc, but these were present before the vaccination, though not as severe.

                                                A little less than 3 hours after getting the shot, I noticed the injection site was getting very sore. Within about a half hour of first noticing it, that entire muscle was aching a lot. It?s now 4:50pm and it hurts to lift my arm, reach for anything, I can even feel it just by typing this out. I?ve also noticed I?m pretty tired, my joints feel very achey like when I have a cold, and I?m incredibly thirsty. The pain in the muscle at injection site is by far the worst symptom though. It?s extremely painful. I did not expect that since it didn?t hurt when getting the actual shot. Took my temp and it?s normal. The aching joints are far less painful than my arm, but are an issue nonetheless. Had I known this would happen beforehand, I would still get the shot, so as long as it doesn?t get a lot worse or something else haplens, all in all I?d have to say it was worth it.

The next day I was so exhausted I couldn&#39;t work for 2 days.  I barely got out of bed until about 40 hours after the shot where I was able to get out and do some gardening.   The reason I am filling this out was at right around 72 hours after the vaccine, I was laying down watching a YouTube video feeling quite relaxed.  I then experienced a tachycardia event where my heart rate went up to 120 and stayed there for about an hour.  I remained calm and was not experiencing anxiety, but the heart rate persisted.  I have had this happen before in panic attacks, but it&#39;s quite rare and I am in acute, high level stress.    Almost 2 weeks later to the day, I had another tachycardia, stronger than any I&#39;ve had my entire life that only lasted about 7 seconds, but I would estimate my heart rate jumped to over 250.   I thought I was going to go into cardiac arrest it was so jarring.  I&#39;m not sure if that one was related to the vaccine.

                                                I began feeling soreness at the injection site started within 12 hours of receiving the vax.  The soreness progressively became worse over the next 7-9 days and was accompanied by swelling of the muscle around the injection site (peaking at about 7 days post-injection). The discomfort at times extended down my arm, but never past my elbow.  When extending my arm outwards (e.g., when reaching for something), I would feel an unusual stiffness and moderate discomfort in my arm.  As of April 12 (13 days post-vax), the swelling is largely gone, but there is still some discomfort when extending my arm outwards.  In addition, there appear to be dry patches of skin between the injection site and my armpit.  I have not sought medical treatment for these adverse reactions to date, nor do I anticipate needing to unless the discomfort becomes more intense.

Unsure about &#34;Moderna arm&#34; due to 2 months since last shot.  Starting on steroids.  If worsens, will treat with antibiotics.

Treatment: Begin taking Zyrtec. 3/12: Itching, scratchy feeling spread to upper back. 3/12-3/15: Itching on back accompanied by tenderness, burning sensation like sunburn that spread to entire back, neck , head, and upper arms. Itching spread to legs, arms, groin, around eyes. Scratching raised occasional welts on legs and arms but didn&#39;t on back, just created more intense pruritus. Saw dermatologist 3/19 who recommended upping dose of antihistamine. Saw allergist 3/23 who gave similar direction. Treated with 1 Zyrtec twice a day until 4/12, then ceased because of excessive fatigue, and started treated with hydrocortisone OTC 3x/day. Outcome: Itching, burning, stinging sensation remains, especially on back, but also on neck and arms and legs.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

Around 2pm and 7pm (27 hours and 32 hours after the shot) , I had two episodes of fever up to 102.9 degrees. During both times, I took a nap and woke up feeling better. The only treatment I had was drinking lots of fluids and took Advil Liquid gels to help with the situation. In aboutba 24 hour period, I did not feel well but after that 24 hour period, all the symptoms subsided except for minor headaches.

Was diagnosed with Shingles in a telemedicine doctor?s visit sponsored by my insurance plan and she prescribed Valtrex. The rash and pain due to the shingles lasted nearly 2 weeks.

Reports rash developed approximately one week following administration of first Moderna vaccine which he received 3/22/21.  Reports the rash is very itchy.  Scalp red and irritated from scratching.  Consulted with medical director and deferred vaccination until rash could be evaluated further. Patient&#39;s rash was evaluated on 4/21/21.  Physician believes rash possibly due to Moderna vaccine as patient denies any changes to medications, soaps, etc.  Patient was prescribed Prednisone taper, Kenalog cream and Vistaril.  Patient reports a history of tinea versicolor and originally thought the itching/rash was a flare of tinea versicolor.  Patient also reports use of hair dye the day prior to vaccination and approximately 1 week following first vaccination.

He has never had them before, since the vaccine he had swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under the chin, and head. His skin has felt itchy and burns a times. Three days ago his skin hurt to touch and last night on April 25 he started getting a rash under his arm. This morning it had spread across his back and chest. We went to the Doctor and he was diagnosed with shingles.

                                                I had what I thought was &#34;normal&#34; pain at the injection site (left shoulder) initially however the pain spread from the injection site downward to my mid triceps by Saturday to Sunday afternoon. By Sunday night my shoulder mobility began to diminish (lifting the arm enough to comfortably shower was challenging). By Monday my shoulder and elbow radiated with pain originating at the injection site. By Monday afternoon I had lost virtually all mobility and strength in shoulder such that I could not raise my arm high enough to wash my left arm/hand enough to wash my hands in a kitchen sink/bathroom (which has NEVER been an issue). Since Monday, any activity that innervates the left shoulder to generate movement results in debilitating pain. By Tuesday the pain, immobility, and strengthless-ness had spread gradually to my left pectoral muscle, my left rear deltoids, my left elbow, my left forearm and slightly into my left pinky and ring fingers. Wednesday (today) all the symptoms from Tuesday are still present with the added symptom that maintaining proper posture through my left shoulder is also painful so now I&#39;m hunching on my left side.

After tossing and turning all night with no sleep I got up at 5:45 a.m. I woke with a headache that lasted for about an hour and a 1/2 it went away then came back. Also when I was sleeping at night I noticed there was pain under my armpit. When I came home to take a shower I noticed my armpit was swollen In one spot. There is a little pain at the injection site but no swelling no redness.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

The top of my head was sensitive and I started running a low grade fever (99.1) at about the 26 hour mark from receiving the 2nd shot. Symptoms persisted until about hour 36 when the fever broke. By hour 48 I felt much better but had low stamina. At hour 60, I feel completely normal.

                                                Patient is a 41 y.o. male on no AC/AP with no pmhx reported presents 1/31 PM initially to Hospital for acute onset 10/10 headache refractory to 800mg motrin which started in occipital region then spread to whole head and neck, nausea and vomiting x 3. Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

On March 7th at about 10:00 am, I developed a pruritic papular rash to my right arm.  The rash was from my right wrist to my antecubital area.  The next 1-2 days I developed another pruritic papular rash to the left side of my neck and my  left ear.  I developed another rash to my both my eyelids and to the skin area around my eyebrows.  As of today 03/11/21, I continue to have the rashes.  Today I also developed pruritis and a red macular rash to my left palm and continue to have continued pruritis to both arms, my scalp and both eyes.

Significant fatigue the  day after injection with ongoing fatigue following.   Elevated heart rate for at least the day following the injection.  Pain at injection site for 3 days

                                                It was the Moderna Vaccine. I had a prescheduled meeting to get some tests done on the Monday, following my vaccine (02/22/2021). The results of those labs showed a severe inflammatory response. My blood platelet levels were at 27, and my CRP was at 15. I started bruising easily, which I have never done before, and I had serious body aches and fatigue. I met with Dr.  on Tuesday, March 16, 2021 to do some follow up tests. At this point, my platelet levels were up to 96, much improved, but still low. He said that it could very likely be connected to the vaccine. I had the first dose on January 23, 2021, and the second dose on February 20, 2021. I now have to get additional tests to see if these levels improve.

                                                Approximately 54 hours after receiving shot I noticed a couple hives on the lower portion of my body.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and went to bed around 10pm.  I woke up around 1am on 3/20 and noticed that my lips were very swollen and I had several hives on the lower half of my body.  Additionally my scrotum was enlarged.  Other than the physical symptoms I felt fine - no fever, body aches, pain, or respiratory issues.  I decided to go back to bed after taking 2 Advil.  I woke up at 7am and was still having a reaction so I decided to go to the ER.  While at the ER the gave me steroid and Benadryl which immediately started working to reduce the reaction.  They took blood work which came back &#34;essentially perfect&#34; according to the Dr.  I was discharged and prescribed an epipen, and a steroid which i took for two days.  I was instructed to follow up with my primary care physician which I did on 3/26.  The ER Dr believed that my reaction was caused by something that i had ate; however, to the best of my knowledge, I am NOT allergic to any foods.  Shortly before the reaction I had eaten a can of ravioli and some bread.  The can from a 12 pack that we bought at the grocery store approximately 6 months ago.  It as the last can in the pack and I did not have a reaction to any of the previous cans.  I met with my family Dr&#39;s PA the following week and she indicated that while there is no way to know with 100% confidence that the reaction was from the shot, she noted that it was highly unlikely that my reaction was from the ravioli can.  The PA informed me that I needed to use extra caution should I decide to get the second shot.  I am scheduled to receive the second shot on 4/14.

                                                Went to ED 3/30/21  Immediately after receiving the second vaccine 2/25 he developed chest tightness and joint pain. The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

At that point he began to have angioedema and bilateral hand swelling  and large generalized wheals. He never had difficulty breathing or swallowing. He was seen by another provider and given a solu-medrol injection followed by high, tapered dose of prednisone.   3 days after treatment pt returned to clinic and was seen by me.

Also the expected arm soreness at the injection site.  I had the same symptoms with the first shot but more intense and lasting all the next day.  For the first shot I had just gotten over a cold earlier that week.  Also on the second shot I made a point of drinking a lot of Gatorade the night of the injection and another the morning after. Otherwise I did things about the same for both.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma and Hyperthyroidism. Concomitant products included FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE (FLOVENT) for an unknown indication.   On 22-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out to sleep at 745 pm) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 19-Apr-2021 at 11:30 PM, the patient experienced COLD SWEAT (cold sweats), ASTHENIA (really weak), DYSSTASIA (could barely stand up) and ILLNESS (sick to his stomach). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VERTIGO (head spinning), DIZZINESS (dizzy), FATIGUE (tired), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (pain at injection site) and NAUSEA (nauseas). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out to sleep at 745 pm), COLD SWEAT (cold sweats), ASTHENIA (really weak), DYSSTASIA (could barely stand up), ILLNESS (sick to his stomach), VERTIGO (head spinning), DIZZINESS (dizzy), FATIGUE (tired), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (pain at injection site) and NAUSEA (nauseas) had not resolved. Not Provided          Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included thyroid medication.  Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  Based on the information provided which includes a temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Nausea, fatigue, and vaccination site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                The 21st, I only felt some fatigue and tiredness as well as the injection site was tender. The following morning, however, was very unpleasing!!! My entire left arm was swollen TWICE its normal size. The injection site was extremely tender to the touch. I could barely use my arm. I had to assist that arm with my other arm. I was extremely lethargic/tired/fatigued. So much that I was in bed 95% of that 24-36 hour time frame; unconscious!!! I was having sporadic &#34;head changes&#34; all day. I was very scared and worried!!! I was unable to perform task at home as well as was unable to work!!!

                                                3-5 hrs s/p vaccine- soreness at injection site. About 12h s/p vaccine administered (around 9p) began to experience chills, headache, fatigue.  This persists/worsens accompanied by chills. Temp taken at 10p (99.1, my normal is 97.6) By 0150, temp up to 100.4 along with continuing alternating sweats/chills and persisting headache. 1000mg Tylenol used at 0150.  At 0240, symptoms settle a bit and got a little sleep. 0445, woke up- headache persists. Mild chills/sweats. Afebrile at 98.6. Still fatigued. At 0800 on 1/5/21, another 1000mg Tylenol used as aforementioned symptoms worsening.  Now at 1035 (time of this report), chills/sweats have settled - left with fatigue, headache, and nasal congestion.    Of note, I tested positive for COVID and was sick for about 2-3 weeks in Sep 2020.

As of today 1/12/21 I am still experiencing symptoms even while using Benadryl allergy tablets by mouth and anti-itch cream applied to the injection site.

On 1/12/2021, upon removing shirt at approximately 4:00 PM, silver dollar sized area of induration , hotness, pain and erythema noted at injection site.  No fever was observed. Contacted ID MD at employer and informed him of the findings.  He advised it could be an immune mediated response vs. cellulitis. Went to Urgent Care site on 1/13/2021 and was dx with cellulitis and was prescribed cephalexin 500 mg PO TID x 10 days.  By 1/16/2021, induration, pain, and erythema has resolved.  Interestingly, injection site is still a bit warmer than the surrounding tissue.

                                                On January 25 I noticed a rash/hives on my chest and abdomen area.  It has been almost 24 hours and they have not resolved.  The severity is about a 3 out of 10, they have remained localized and are only mildly itchy.  I have no other symptoms and I have not altered my daily routine or interacted with anything which could explain the hives.  I have not been ill for over 6 months but the rash reminds me of after recovering from a virus when it is shedding.  I spoke with a healthcare provider and he suggested I file a report.

                                                3 minutes after vaccination the patient began to feel a tingling and pain in his arm where the vaccine was placed.  Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

Shortly thereafter (2 weeks) developed shingles on my right side with extreme pain culminating in an emergency room visit and follow up care by primary physician. Unknown if shingles were related to vaccine.

I had it checked out at the walk in clinic and they said it was an allergic reaction and to take Benadryl along with icing the arm.  I was not the best at following this but once I started doing this is started to get better and was cleared up within a week.

I call the nurse line and requested a CBC.  On 2 February, the Emergency Department called me back and stated my platelets were at 6K (over the last 10 years with CLL, they consistently are at 110K-120K).  The emergency department directed me to come in and began treatment with Prednisone and platelet transfusion.  I was transferred to Hospital  where they started IVIG and 40mg of Dexamethasone for four days.  I was discharged on 7 February with stable platelets at 42K

There was still one blister that had not burst yet. The other two had bursted leaving me to have an open sore as though someone had burned my skin. I immediately contacted the facility that administered the shot to me. They then advised me to go to the nearest Urgent care for treatment. Upon my arrival, treated me for the scaring from the Moderna injection.  provided with an oniment to be applied daily until the sore/blister is healed.

                                                I received my first Covid-19 Moderna injection and felt slightly groggy and tired as the day progressed. Just before bed I noticed my arm was quite sore and I still felt tired and slightly light headed. The next day (Feb 4) I had a very sore left arm at the injection site but felt good otherwise. I came home from work and took one 200mg Ibuprofen as my arm was still quite sore. The following day (Feb 5) my arm pain subsided but I still felt light headed during the evening. I am writing this on Feb. 18th and each day I have bouts of being light headed and have difficulty concentrating. There is no real pattern to what time of day I get the symptoms. I do not have the classic headache but definitely feel pressure in my head and behind my eyes. I also find that I wake up after a full nights sleep and feel not well rested. I spoke with my doctor last week and he suggested I give it until this week to see where things are at. I plan on contacting him soon to schedule an appointment to discuss my symptoms more. Before getting the vaccine I did not have any of these symptoms as I describe.

                                                The person who stuck me with that needle injected the vaccine way too high and the entire dose wound up inside my shoulder socket and now I cant use my arm. I know exactly what happened because I&#39;ve had my other shoulder broken no less than three times. I know exactly what a shoulder socket full of fluid feels like. There is no discerible swelling it redness, and absolutely none of the bruise-like pain normally associated with any if the dozens of vaccinations a person gets throughout their lifetime. The pain is inside my shoulder and comes from trying to use my arm. It feels like my arm is going to come out if the socket if I so much as move my arm away from my body. If this person is doing this to other people then he needs to be stopped ASAP. No names were given. He is a shorter male, medium build, darker skin, (far as I could tell from the PPE), and spoke with a slight accent.

Around 10 days after received vaccine, developed pain around rib case and a rash that resembles mild case of shingles, and that is in same location and with same symptoms as with prior bouts of shingles that I have had over the years.

Some hours later, my entire right arm was covered with large, painful, black and purple bruising. I had never experienced anything like this in my life. I often see blood in my urine, and during this time there was an unusually large amount. I don&#39;t know how to describe the feeling of lumps moving through my body, but I could definitely feel the movement through my arms and legs.

On way home my lips started to tingle a bit and I felt warmer over my body. I got home and felt exhausted for multiple days but on the first day I could not sleep. By the weekend I was just worn out and slept all day the following Sat and Sunday.  My arm hurt so bad I couldn?t lay on it and I even  today either have phantom arm pain or real arm pain. But I know where the shot was because I feel it. It still feels like a deep tissue bruise.

By 2 p.m. my partner noticed I was very warm and took my temperature. I had a 100.1 degree fever. So I took a single adult dose of Tylenol, napped for a few hours, and I felt much better afterwards. I didn&#39;t need any further doses because by late evening, all symptoms (except the mild arm soreness) were nearly gone.

I was ache all over, skin sensitivity, light sensitivity, feeling feverish and suddenly exhausted. Very tired. Just wanted to close my eyes. I went home and went to bed where for the next 5 hours I was in and out of poor dream disturbed sleep. Waking up moaning and very uncomfortable. Constant headache. Mild blurry vision. Very sore arm at injection site.

Symptoms began Saturday, 4/10; pt was helping her mother around her house; was not straining excessively; however, later that day had a sudden burning sensation in her lower-mid back, which has since been recurring in paroxysms.  At times it spreads into the posterior thighs but not into the feet; sometimes also spreads upward into the upper back and just below the chin.  In between attacks, there is no pain or numbness.  There has never been weakness. No urinary/bowel incontinence or saddle anesthesia; sphincter tone was normal.  NIF/FVC normal -60, 2.3L.  Paroxysmal pain controlled w/ 600mg gabapentin q8h since being hospitalized.  There has been no development or progression or symptoms, still only pain and normal neurologic and physical exam.

                                                On 4/22/21, approximately 1 hr after the Moderna COVID-19 first vaccination injection, I started to encounter allergic reactions that I used to suffer about 20 years ago. My air intake decreased, and my skin began to become irritated. I formerly had environmental allergies that would reduce my air intake, and the first place I noticed the effects were on my skin and I would become irritable. Physicians told me that when my oxygen levels were low, the body would channel the air to where it was most needed, which is generally not the skin, so my skin would become irritated. When this used to occur, I would respond involuntarily with facial twitches and pulling at my face and hair. Physicians explained that these twitches and pulling actions would draw air to the surface of my skin where I was air depleted. When I took the Moderna injection, this happened again -- I found myself with low air, my face was twitching, and I was pulling on my face to draw air to the area. The result when I was 19 and dealing with allergies is that I would remove small patches of hair from my head or eyebrows or eyelashes, and this would happen almost unconsciously as I tried to stimulate the areas and draw air to the surface of my skin. I did the same thing on 4/22/21, and found later, when looking into a mirror, that I had removed a section of my eyebrow unconsciously. It all comes back to oxygen depletion. A different and more intense event occurred in the night of Friday, 4/23/21, and the early morning of Saturday, 4/24/21. I went to bed at about 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. Between that time and approximately 1:30 a.m., I had difficulty sleeping, and I dreamed of pain in my chest. I finally woke up about 1:30 a.m. and found the pain in my chest was real. I was having difficulty breathing deeply. It felt as if  the lower part of my lungs (at least on one side) was solidifying or inaccessible. What I did was begin forcing myself to breathe as deeply as possible. Over a period of 30 minutes or longer, I was able to gradually reclaim the use of the deepest part of my longs. With every forced deep breath, I was able to chip away at the area that felt like it was freezing up. Finally, I felt that I could access the deepest part of my longs and breath normally. The pain and lack of use in my lower lungs were very concerning.

It began at my neck and proceeded to travel all down my body. It felt as if I had a horrible case of poison ivy. My PCP gave me two rounds of prednisone and also had me take allegra and Pepcid AC. , Thr full-body itchy became very painful and I am left with hundreds of little sores and scratches all over me. I am now almost 20 days from the first shot and on a daily basis I have 2-3 painful itchy hot spots. My doctor recommended that I do not get the second shot.I am so angry I put this unapproved poison in  my body.

                                                After first vaccine, experienced moderate level hives on both arms and both legs for 7 days. Did not have hives on my core, neck or face.  The hives first appeared within an hour of the vaccine.  I took one benadryl capsule every 12 hours for 7 days to contain the allergic reaction.  I paused one time, skipping a 12 hour dose and the hives spread. The hives then subsided after restarting the benadryl.  After 7 days, the hives were mostly gone and I stopped taking benadryl.  No further reaction was observed.

At date of vaccination I hadn&#39;t had a flare up or irritation in at least 2 years. Day after vaccination, and now day 3 after I&#39;ve had a large flare up of my lichen planus. My Leg (calf) and penis (glans) very itchy and obviously broken out. I can&#39;t be only assume it&#39;s vaccine related.

I attempted to treat the rash with Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP, 0.5%. On Tuesday, February 19th, I noticed the rash had spread from the back of my neck to the front and down and across my chest. The rash also began appearing on the sides of my face and above my eyebrows.

The following two days my arm was sore at the injection site but that went away in a couple days.  3 days post vaccination, my right axilla and median and ulnar nerves were extremely sensitive for 3 days but that subsided.  6 days post vaccine I started to get extreme fatigued, low energy and feel like my nerves were hot.  I got a covid test which was negative because I was not feeling well.  Then 9 days post vaccine I started to feel very fatigued, achey, and I couldn?t sleep well and like my nerves were burning up all over my body.  I had to call out of work due to brain fog, fatigue, nerve heat, difficulty concentrating.  I took my temperature during all this and it was 97.7.  My hands felt very hot and I could wash them under warm water because the water felt way too hot.

                                                Left Arm became very sore.  Left Bicep had deep ache and spasm. I developed a large painful knot under the skin.  As time went on the are immediately at injection site got red and inflamed. By Thursday the redness transversed the width of my arm. Friday a large red ring began to go around injection site and the center began to be less red and then appeared blanched.  The Ring was maybe 4&#34; x 8&#34; which got more inflamed through Saturday. By Sunday the ring was still there, but less inflamed.  I did not take any medication except Tylenol starting on Thursday at 10:00 AM as I developed 102.8 fever until Friday morning.  I did experience Headache and chills, but I considered that minor compared to my arm and the local reaction that occurred. I did not go  to Doctor, but rather waited to inform medical staff at my employer, as I am a healthcare worker.

I woke up on January 23rd, 2021 at approximately 0800 hours and felt general soreness in my muscles and joints. By 0900 hours, joint pain was much worse as it hurt just to stand. At approximately 1130 hours, I started feeling chills. I wore two layers of sweatshirts and sweatpants plus blankets. I could not get warm. By approximately 1300 hours, I had a low grade fever of 100.3 - 100.6. I went to bed at approximately 2200 hours, woke up at approximately 1030 hours  on Sunday the 24th, 2021 and had no longer felt the pain, chills or fever.

                                                Joint Pain, initially started primarily in pinky knuckle on Day 2 and each day progressed to additional knuckles on right hand until I could not make a fist at 4th day. Progressed to left hand and other joints (knees) by 4th day. Use of acetaminophen helped alleviate  pain and permitted more movement.   By day 6,  pain  reduced to no longer need medication. As of Today,  joints are still not back to normal still slightly tight. Injection site was sore for 5 days.

                                                While administering the vaccine I was sitting on a stool with wheels.  The bolt had at some point become loosened and when I shifted my weight forward on the stool to administer the vaccination  the wheel came off and the stool came out from underneath me.  I had administered the vaccination but had not pulled the syringe from the patients arm when this happened.  I  landed on the floor looking up at the patient.  The  vaccine had been administered but the syringe was still in the patients arm.  I immediately jumped up and removed the syringe.  The syringe came out smoothly.  The needle was not bent.  I immediately placed the syringe in the sharps container per vaccination protocol.  The  patient did bleed.   Though no more than  with previous patients who have a superficial capillary nick.   The patient did not move during the incident.  He did not  move his arm or rise or jump.  He was surprised and stayed immobile.   I immediately asked if he was ok and he stated he has never bled before from a vaccination.  The patient stayed the requisite 20 minutes post vaccination waiting period.   Before the patient left I removed the band aid to inspect the vaccination site.  The area was red, but did not seem to have a tear or wound.  The patient stated he felt fine.

The symptoms cleared around 9:30 pm CST that evening.

Sometimes I break out in the middle of the night if my bed gets a little warm. I never had problems with any of those things before the shots.

He didn&#39;t sleep well, and this morning his sleep app indicated his heart rate during the night was between 100-110.  After noticing his heart rate was between 130-140, he called the clinic and was told to go to the ER.  Hospital ER administered several tests and did blood work. The MD&#39;s determined his heart was fine and it is likely vaccine related.  He is home again and is feeling better (no chills, etc.) and his resting heart rate is now in the low-90&#39;s.

I also experienced acute memory loss, I can remember events at 4 PM on day of injection but nothing until the next morning, and I have inflammation and swelling at my left knee, likely pre-patellar bursitis. There is no history of either moderate side effect. There is no obvious explanation (e.g. a fall) that explains the knee bursitis.

In fact it has gotten worse, now my arm feels week, my fingers tingle and the burning sensation radiates to my neck and left ear.  I been to the emergency room, VA clinic, and local clinic and nobody has helped me. Everyone just tells me to take ibuprofen, Tylenol, naproxen, use hot and cold compressions. Nothing has helped, If someone can call me and help me I will really appreciated.

                                                I experienced two separate adverse reactions.   First adverse reaction occurred on 2/11/21 at 5:00 am (after receiving my second shot of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine).  I experienced tachycardia with an approximate heart rate of 175 bp for approximately 30 minutes.  I was able to lower my heart rate down with 25 mg of quick release metoprolol.   Second adverse reaction started on 2/21/21.  I developed shingles on my lower left side.  It appears the shingles originated from my L1 dermatome.  At the current time 2/10/21 I am still recovering from my shingles.

Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

Stated that they rash was itchy, but not painful. They said they noticed the rash 3/30/2021, the day after their vaccination. This was reported to us over the phone, so was not able to see the rash in person. It was difficult to tell based on the description if it was related to the vaccine or not. Asked the patient if they were having any other issues/symptoms related to the vaccine. The patient stated other than a sore arm no. The patient was instructed that benadryl could be used to help with the itching, and that it was important that got in to a doctor as soon as possible to get the rash looked at.

It is swollen to the point that I can see the skin is raised.

                                                Today afternoon/evening I started to get sore and have a headache (which is normal from what I hear.) I could only sleep a couple hours Tuesday night into Wednesday morning because I kept tossing and turning. When I woke up Wednesday morning (4-21-21) around 6:00 am, I couldn&#39;t move as I normally could and when I tried to walk I found it very painful. The whole area between my knees and my shoulders were completely numb yet it felt as if it were on fire. I slept most of the morning and a little in the afternoon as it was very painful to move, talk, laugh, etc... Finally in the late afternoon (3:00-4:00ish) the numbness wore off but the burning sensation persisted. I felt progressively better throughout Thursday (4-22-21) and about the same time in the afternoon (3:00-4:00ish) the burning wore off as well. That evening I felt perfectly normal except for the typical achiness that tends to occur with  vaccines. Today (Friday 4-23-21) I feel rested and back to my normal self.

                                                Day of shot slight dizziness and weakness, second day minimal adverse reactions; slight chills, 3rd day (early morning) total body aches and pains, nausea and major dizziness; full body chills, extreme loss of strength; site of shot internal and external pain leading up to the back of neck, 4th day complete incapacitation  uncontrollable shacking from chills; bones ached; constipation; nausea without ability to vomit; 5th day same effects if not worse; still unable to vomit but feeling of endless need to stuck in upper chest, 6th day chills begin to break and body pain subsiding; still weak and dizzy with major headaches, 7th day chills are almost completely gone, body (muscles, tendons, etc) ridiculously tight and aching from the constant shaking from chills and restless sleep over 7 days.   Lots and lots of liquids from day 1; day 4 started taking minimal acetaminophen to ease pain and feelings of fever. Temperature never went above 96degrees.  Small portioned meals to get nutrients, and constant liquids to stay hydrated. This did not relieve any symptoms, until night 7 when pain started to subside. Constant stretching now to release the constricting of all my muscles and tendons over the course of side effects. Still constipated and slight nausea, still weak in strength.

                                                After being exposed to COVID the first week of May,   I presented with a chicken pox type rash on my trunk and back.  The rash has been slowly spreading to my extremities and I have also had oral lesions appear.  I have had chickenpox as a child in the past when I was twelve.  Suspecting COVID after my son tested positive  I took a rapid Binax test on May 12 and it came back inconclusive which I then followed up with a salvia test the same day that came back negative later.  After trying a steroid burst prescribed by a dermatologist the rash did not improve and continued to spread.  I recently completed a CBC and CMP which showed an elevated eosinophil count and low anion gap.  I am not sure if this is a direct effect from the vaccine but I wanted to put my symptoms out there in case more dermatological events are reported.  The rash does not seem to respond to steroids either topical or oral but there is some minimal relief provided by topical Benadryl and oral hydroxyzine.

                                                About 45 mins after getting the shot. I experienced a tightening of the face with hives.  It felt like the last time I got a bee sting and found out I was allergic to bees.  My neck musscles where tight but it was not enough for me to take my epi pen  I  slepped until 5-19. only awake for about 6 hours a day. When I normally sleep that much.  Then  on 5-19.  Around noon time I woke up and was able to stay awake. I was experiencing fast heart rates from time to time. Still very tired.  I was drinking about 32 ounces of water an hour.  Then on friday 5-21. The heart issues where very severe and I went to the Emergency room.  They gave me an iv bag of fluid and I felt better but still had minnor heart fast rates from time to time.  I still felt off. and had a follow up with my primary dr.  During the visit he observed high blood preasure of around 144/90.  Currently i am observation phase and purchased a blood pressure monitor. According to the over the counter blood pressure monitor .   I have been as high as 152/106  and slowly over time it has gone down to as low as 79/58. With more of an average currently holding around 122/80. The monitor has detected two irregular hearbeats with bp stat(138/82, 82bp anb 79/58, and bp 76. I will continue to monitor and report these self monitoring finding to my primary DR on 7-6. I left a message today about updates.

                                                Severe Headache within 1 hour of vaccination (01/20/21 @1330hours), followed by a slight fever within 6 hours and fatigue. Overnight, I experienced severe chills and body aches, and severe fatigue, which followed the rest of the morning (01/21/21) with general discomfort. By that early afternoon the chills subsided, and I continued to feel body aches with minimal joint pain. By 4 pm, I began to develop an itchy rash on my left wrist under my wristwatch, left hand and on my right forearm. I experience fatigue throughout the rest of the day. I used over the counter Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream to alleviate the itch.  On the Morning of 01/22/23, I woke up to a itchy rash over my torso and my hands. I continued to apply the cream and I took an OTC Benadryl allergy pill, which seems to subside the rash.  On 01/23/21, I woke up the the same  rash over my feet and overall, the rash over my torso and hands had substantially subsided.

                                                After the first day there was the typical site injection pain. Three Tylenol on the next day seem to take care of that but the pain quickly moved to the Front and top of the right pelvic bone. No amount of Tylenol has seem to do anything with that pain. After a week it seem to start to migrate to the left front top pelvic bone. These symptoms were mild and I was still able to carry out my daily activities in law-enforcement.  Friday night January 22 is when I started to have pulsating pressure in the back of my head, chills, dizziness, excessive urination, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. The symptoms have persisted through today but are starting to ease. I took a COVID-19 test on Sunday, January 24 the results came back today as Covid negative.

                                                I received the dose on Friday 1/29.  About 45 minutes after the left side of my face felt numb.  Over the weekend I then thought I was developing acne (which is strange because I don&#39;t get acne).  By Monday it was getting terrible on the left side of my face and by bedtime I thought it was shingles.  I went to my general practitioner on Tuesday 2/2 and was diagnosed with shingles and prescribed Famciclovir 500 mg 3 x daily for 7 days.

                                                My left deltoid muscle is still aching at 7 weeks after this first injection.  I first noticed after 5-6 days when the expected initial pain of the shot subsided. I thought it would go away soon, but only realized that it would not when my right shoulder was fine 3 days after my 2nd shot. I have received my 2nd COVID vaccine 4 weeks after on Feb 9 in the right deltoid. There is no aching or adverse effects in my right arm at the time of this report.  I have reason to believe that the first shot was given too high in the left shoulder and possible SIRVA is the result in my left deltoid shoulder joint.   I use ibuprofen 800mg 3x daily, and that doesn?t take all the aching away. It is a persistent ache that doesn?t interfere with my ability to work, yet it limits my ability to do upper body exercises.

                                                5 days after injection I noticed a hive on my stomach.  The hives spread to additional areas of body over the next 24 hours including the face, scalp, neck, arms, back, and additional hives on chest.  This morning the majority are focused on my head and face area.  I&#39;ve double checked everything and haven&#39;t eaten or been in contact with anything out of the ordinary.    Also want to point out I had Covid in October 2020.  Also, I had a very sore arms for 2 days after shot along with exhaustion the 2nd day and a fever/chills (103 degrees) on my second night after injection.

Today on 3/30/2021 it looks much bigger.  Now it?s all the way down to his inside elbow, very red (about 6 inches).  It looks very big and I?m concerned it?s infected.  He does not currently have a fever nor is it warm to touch.   We may call doctor later to ask about it.

On the first night after the vaccination I began to get body aches.  During day 2 the body aches became extreme, where getting out of bed or moving was painful.  The body aches were less severe on days 2 and 3, but are still continuing on day 4.  I was running  a fever all of day during days 2, 3, and 4.  I was throwing up on day 3.  I had GI pain and diarrhea on day 4.  I never have headaches, but have had a headache since day 2 and it is now day 5.  I have had lower back pain since day 2 and that also continues today (day 5).

                                                Day after vaccine I developed sever jaundice including yellowing eyes.  One week after vaccine I had blood work done and my liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were.  On 3/23 I admitted myself to ER with jaundice and vomiting.  My liver levels were normal but bilirubin was still high.  At this point I had lost 30 pounds since my shot.   I was in the hospital for 5 days where the ran UT, CT, and MRI on my abdomen with none showing issues.   Jaundice and itchiness/jaundice got progressively worse.   The hospital ran multitude of blood tests to pin point the issue and even did a liver biopsy.  No tests showed anything abnormal but biopsy isn?t back yet.  At this point 4/1/21, I am still jaundiced, extremely itchiness, lethargy and a total of 33 pounds weigh loss.

                                                Experience chest pain on right side of chest near armpit which spread across chest one week after the first vaccine shot given on January 25, 2021.  Pain was going away before the second shot. Received second shot on February 22, 2021 and had the chest pain return, extreme fatigue, headaches, rash at injection site and all over back, achy muscles mainly in upper body, dizzy spells, nausea, and abdominal pain. All these symptoms (minus nausea) continued for three weeks and some are still present (fatigue, chest pain and periodic headaches) after six weeks.   I was tested for antibodies and the results came back greater than 400, which is the max limit for the test.  The doctor has never seen results that high and we have no idea how high my antibodies actually are.   Since my symptoms seem to be slightly improving, the doctor did not recommend further treatment.  However, I am concerned as to any possible danger of antibody levels this high.

                                                I was administered the shot by a nurse and was monitored for 15 min afterwards. I felt fine until later that day in the evening I started to notice some pain in the injection site and some redness and swelling. Early in the morning on the next day I was very tired and fatigued and the pain and swelling was visibly worse and lasted throughout the rest of the day into the evening. This morning I was still tired and fatigued but was noticeably better than the previous day. There is still some pain and redness and swelling but it is getting better. It should be noted I was given the shot on my right arm where a tattoo is located.

He was with his father that time and they were seated at the Waiting Area.

His palms were warm the whole time, no clamminess. 911 came and they attended to the patient and took him.

I checked my temperature &amp; only once was the temperature above 100F.   I did have some chest pain at times as well.   I drank mint tea, took tylenol at regular intervals &amp; used icy hot on the sore back and neck.    Following morning I&#39;m feeling a little better but still quite a bit of soreness but as of 7 am , the chills/hots have subsided.  I did pee a lot over night; at one point I went to the bathroom about 5-6 times within an hour to 90 minutes.

                                                had pain in left arm at injection site, but expected that. got sick after second dose (which is strange as I got really sick after the first one), that went away after roughly 36 hrs, however the injection site pain had radiated down the left arm. still, just assumed it&#39;d go away, no worries. woke up the second day after shot, with feeling as if id maybe slept funny, as my shoulder on the left arm had a shooting pain thru to my arm, which was numb and tingly, and my hand felt like it was asleep...total pins and needles. shook it, didnt go away. mind you, I&#39;m not a guy who thinks he&#39;s sick all the time, and is constantly at the doctor. I actually don&#39;t have a doctor, nor insurance, but I just usually ride whatever out..but this was becoming more than an annoyance. now its been three weeks or so, and the symptoms have just gotten worse. I&#39;d say I&#39;ve lost about 90% of the strength in my left hand. I can&#39;t make a fist, hold objects, pull up my pants, pick my nose, play my guitar, etc..my hand is never not buzzing with pins and needles, in a semi-claw shape, and its losing circulation as its noticeably purplish. yesterday, I called the urgent care that I use as a doctor if absolutely necessary, as I felt I had to do something. I asked if I could come down, described my symptoms, and they said all they&#39;d do is tell me to go to the ER as it sounded not good..now numbness is going down my left leg and foot is swelling.

                                                He got his vaccine, the only thing that really hurt was that it felt like somebody shot him in the arm which lasted for a week.  Then on Sunday he has had what he thought was a heat rash, and went and did laundry and when they dropped him off he has realized that he has a rash that has multiple little spots on his arms and legs, and they fester like a heat rash, and feels like somebody is pinching his skin with  plyers.  On his chest/torso he has the rash that is sensitive to the point that it bothers something rubbing against it.  When they fester up he squeezes them to get rid of the pain and it&#39;s painful.  He also has a dry skin rash on his right butt cheek, which also started when this started as well.   He has not taken anything for this reaction.  He called the pharmacist and they told him to call us and report it.   The area of the shot looks like a state map shape rash area on his shoulder.

                                                2 days after shot I had mild itching on the left arm at the injection side, burning and tingling up and down that arm into my finger tips, facial tingling (neuralgia) and mild itchiness and redness on both cheeks. No rash, hives, or scratching, just mild itchy skin. These symptoms are not frequent, and have not existed prior to the injection.

                                                Headache slight chills started around 3:00 am .  I woke up and was not able to go back to sleep.  Later in the day, while at work, I became extremely fatigued and my chills were getting worse.  I left work early, came home and checked my temperature.  It has been between 102.5 and 103.7 the entire time I have been home.  Even after taking Tylenol.  My arm is also a little tender at the injection site.    I had COVID prior to this but they say I recovered.    My symptoms started on November 13 and was hospitalized for 3 days starting around day 9 of symptoms.  My current symptoms are pretty much identical to the symptoms I had when I first contracted COVID.

The staff member monitoring saw me going to the floor and called the head doctor over to help.  They called EMT&#39;s.  I was laid onto the floor on my back and legs up onto a chair.  The staff took my blood pressure which was low.  Approximately, 2 minutes later, they took my blood pressure and it went back up to a more normal level.  The EMT&#39;s helped me up and took my blood sugar levels and pulse oxygen levels which seemed normal.  I was able to feel better, but the color of my skin was yellowish and pale.  The EMT&#39;s suggested that I talk with my doctor before getting another vaccine and talk about my symptoms.

                                                Nearly two weeks after injection, I now have a 4 inch diameter circle of redness with slight swelling and itchy.  I noticed it after showering two days ago.  It almost looks like a localized allergic reaction but it did not appear until 2 weeks after the shot.  It is slightly warmer to touch than the rest of the area but it is not painful at all.  I had similar markings plus moderate pain around the injection site1-2 days after the shot but they quickly dissipated.  I am not sure if this should be reportable or not but I was a little concerned considering the amount of time that has passed since the shot and considering I am due for my second shot in a couple of weeks.

                                                More than a week after my vaccine the arm near the injection site started getting sore and my body was achy. The next morning I woke up with it swollen, red, warm to the touch, huge knot covering most of my upper arm. I was also nauseous and a little bit of body aches.  Later that day the area that was red also began getting hives. I massaged it, applied a warm compress, and took Benadryl. The next day it was still sore but the redness wasn?t as bad or the arm wasn?t as swollen.  Later that night the redness and warm to the touch was completely gone .

                                                I didn&#39;t have any adverse affects until 5 days after I received the vaccination. Early in the afternoon on Wednesday 1/20 I noticed that my lymph nodes in the armpit of my left arm and on the left side of my neck were swollen and sore. This worsened as the day went on. I also noticed a pimple had formed and came to a head in the exact spot of where the needle stick had been. It &#34;popped&#34; that day and a small amount material came out. My lymph nodes have remained sore and swollen since 1/20. On the 7th day after (1/22) I noticed a couple of smaller, dime sized red blotches/rash on my left shoulder and left side of my neck. I also noticed that the injection site on my left shoulder was sore, swollen and hot to touch. On the 8th day (1/23) I noticed that there were more of these dime sized red blotches/rash across both shoulders, my back and a small area in the center of my chest.  It continues to be like that as of today (1/25). On the 9th day, (1/24) starting just after noon, I began to feel poorly. Achy and just generally not very good. I had a few bouts of diarrhea throughout the afternoon. I also had a pretty strong headache when I awoke on the morning of the 24th. Today, (1/25) I awoke again with a headache although it was not as sore as yesterday. I don&#39;t feel great today, but I do feel better than I did yesterday. The rash looks the same and my lymph nodes seem to be slightly less swollen and less sore.

                                                Let me start by my wife also works at Tech and got the shot right before me.  So, I was comparing my symptoms to hers.  We both complained about pain and swelling at the injection shot but my swelling was much worse than hers.  You could tell that my shoulder was swollen just by looking at my arm with my shirt on.  So, I knew from talking to everyone that took it that my injection shit should hurt for a couple days so I thought that everything was normal.  Then after about a week it had not gone away and even started to hurt worse.  I have gotten to the point that when I have any type of physical activity my shoulder starts killing me.  It&#39;s real sharp pains that cause me to stop what I&#39;m doing and sit down and hold still until the pain fades.  So after about 11 days from the day of the vaccine my wife walked into the kitchen where I was trying to make dinner and had stopped and closed my eyes standing there in pain.  She said, if it hurts that bad you need to see a doctor.  So the next day I visited my doctor and he didn&#39;t really know what was causing it .  It had been 12 days since the injection and you can still slightly feel the  place in my arm.  He gave me a medium dose of  steroids and a antibiotic to see if something like that will help.  Early on I was putting ice packs on it and taking hot showers with the  hot water stream directly on my shoulder.  One strange thing about it is  it only hurts after/during activity and the pain is at other locations like running up my neck  and around the back of my shoulder.  I feel like it&#39;s something  with the joint or nerves because of that.  The only thing that seems to help is my not moving it.

Then severe rash over torso, arms, buttocks, thighs, and back consistent with what I experienced during Lyme Disease this past summer.  Raised itchy rash in large red blotches over most of body.  I didn&#39;t realize it at the time but the same (but less severe) reaction took place after the first Moderna Vaccine shot as well.  I was prescribed Doxycycline by my local Urgent Care and stayed on it for 14 days following the first dose of Moderna.  I didn&#39;t put the two things together immediately because I has gone hunting in the woods and assumed that I was bitten by another tick.  Full body rash is what caused me to go seek attention at the Urgent Care.  The symptoms following the second dose were much more severe and uncomfortable.  The rash subsided in 4-5 days without medication.

In the course of trying to bring warmth to the body, I showered and ended up having severe vomiting. The body aches, fatigue, and overall sickness stayed with me for over 48 hours. Two days post vaccination, my left arm was swollen with severe redness. I am still struggling with fatigue and body aches (4 days later) but have regained mobility and strength.

I then began feeling a severe pain in my left arm at the exact site of the injection that came and went depending on movement of my arm. It felt like a torn muscle. Now, 3 weeks after my final shot, the arm pain is still present and at times feels like it&#39;s worsening. It&#39;s at its most severe when reaching for something.

                                                After receiving my shot, I waited the half an hour. I felt a pinch in my head and tightness in shoulders and neck. Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

Starting using topical Benadryl, hydrocortisone, and topical lotion which helped with itching. Seen by PCP 1 week ago who started him on medrol dose pack.

                                                On 3/16/21, I noticed a rash which closely mirrors what is being described as &#34;COVID arm&#34; at the site of the injection.  This appeared after 72 hours of severe stomach pain and loose stool, combined with fatigue, dizziness, chills/hot spells and lack of appetite.  There has been no fever with any of these symptoms.  The other members of my family who live in my household (Spouse - who also has had one dose of the Moderna vaccine, and our children age 12 and 15) all experienced the same set of symptoms, except the rash at site of vaccine injection.  I thought we had all caught a stomach bug from each other, but now I wonder if my symptoms were related to the rash that I first noticed this morning.

                                                Narrative:  He states experiencing mild disorientation/fog and mild dizziness ~ 20 minutes at the initial vaccination. While he was still oriented to person/place/time, he states having difficulty in trying to find his car (no issues reported during the 15 minute waiting period). Both concerns resolved w/in 5 minutes spontaneously. He had not had a prior similar reaction to a past vaccination. Denied pruritus (other than over injection area), urticaria/hives, flushing, swelling/angioedema, lightheadedness, weakness/difficulty ambulating, syncope/LOC, SOB/dyspnea, tachycardia/palpitations, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, abdominal cramping. He has no allergies that he is aware of and was able to work afterwards. RN reviewed common adverse effects and when to seek care. Advised 30 minutes of supervised post-vaccination wait time. Reinforced to alert staff if he experiences any of the adverse effects we discussed related to concerns for immediate allergic reaction. Patients intention is to return to work today (works with health care professional). He was checked on during/at the end of the observation period and reported no issues.

Mild pain at injection site within a few hours.  3am (9 hours after injection) I went to the bathroom, and while standing got dizzy and lightheaded tried to sit down.  Collapsed while trying to sit down and hit head on bathroom floor.  Cut right eyebrow on floor.  Tried to get back to bed and was in and out of consciousness for 30-60 seconds per spouse.  Vasovagal response symptoms.  Cold sweats.  I was very thirsty and drank a tall glass of water.  5 minutes later I stood up and went back to bed feeling fine.  I slept the rest of the night and felt fine the next day, and for the rest of the weekend with no other symptoms.

                                                Other than typical sore arm at injection site, I began to experience massive body tremors and painful chills that started roughly 13 hours after second Moderna dose. The chills were so extreme that my abdomen tightened and caused pain that I could not relax along with jaw tightening and teeth chatter. Once in bed, I experienced severe sweating while trying to stop the chills, then massive chills when removing blankets and extreme all over body aches that caused me to toss and turn all night. I found myself fatigued and sleeping off and on until 5:30 pm (17 hours in bed) the next evening. Chills have since subsided, body aches remained- tiredness remained. Two Tylenol have mostly helped with the body aches, although they are definitely still present, even in my gut.

More sever skin rash appeared again on April 4th. Today, April 6th is the worst day where more skin rash appeared all over my body. Took Zyrtec to cope with it which is helping.

                                                I developed a rash (red splotchy marks on my skin) that started localized under my arms in the arm pit region. I noticed it during my daily shower on 4/9. It was very itchy and then overnight it seemed to spread to other parts of my body including my back, back of my legs behind my knee, upper groin area, down to the tops of my feet and even the palms of my hand were very itchy as well as between my fingers. Basically only my face/head/neck were NOT affected.   Over the next couple of days the rash continued to subside temporarily but then with itching, it would return.   Finally, I am not sure if it is related but I had heart burn like symptoms over night on 4/9 and again on 4/10. That could be a coincidence but I only suffer from heart burn about once every 3 months so it seems strange that I would have it on back to back nights.   This all occurred just over 2 weeks from my vaccination so I thought it might have another cause but I could not figure out another possible explanation for it. I also took pictures if that would be helpful to see.

                                                Soon after injection I developed soreness at injection site, and about an hour later it travelled down my arm and to my hand, with also arm stiffness.  On Monday, 4/12/2021 at 12:15am (about 6 hours after injection) I developed chills and body aches.  Throughout the night I also developed a headache, muscle aches, nausea and started sweating.  At 9am (4/12/2021) when I woke up, all the symptoms continued (chills, body aches, muscle aches, arm soreness and stiffness, headache, nausea) and also felt extreme tiredness.  My temperature at 9:15am was 100.4 degrees F.  I basically stayed in bed and slept most of the day.  I got up at 2:30pm to get something to eat and had a temperature of 101 degrees F.  After eating, which made me feel even more nauseous, I went back to bed and continued to sleep.  I woke up at 7:30pm to feed the cats.  I felt the same as I did at 2:30pm--listed above--and was up and about for 20 minutes.  I started to prepare a quick meal and fainted twice (around 8pm) within a minute from each other.  The first time I fell to my knees and the second time I felt onto my back.  I was unconscious for only a few seconds each time.  I went into bed after and placed an ice pack on my forehead.  I took my temperature after the ice pack at 8:15am and my temperature was 101.4 degrees F.   I ate soup around 8:45am and took Tylenol (1000mg) at 9:30am.  I went back to bed and slept all through the night.  This morning (4/13/2021--2 days after injection) I feel much better--only have some slight chills and arm soreness.  My temperature at 9:15am (4/13/21) was 95.7 degrees F.

                                                After first vaccine on March 15, I only had arm pain at injection site, but I started having pretty regular ringing in my ears, mainly in my left ear and for a very shorty duration each time it occurred. After second injection, I had pain at injection site shortly after injection that became much more intense and moved to my bicep the next morning. On the first day, I also felt tired and unable to concentrate, which became more severe on the second day before subsiding on the third. On the morning of the second day, I began having random, brief pinching pains in different parts of my body. These have occurred randomly since that day, at most 10 times a day or so, primarily in neck, arms and legs. I had a fever of 100.2 on the evening of the second day. The ringing in my ears is now very quiet and high pitched, but more or less constant and in both ears. Whenever it is quiet, I hear it or if I pay attention when it is not quiet, it is still there. I noticed the constant ringing yesterday morning (April 17) and it has persisted.

He presented to clinic about 1 week later for evaluation. There were no obvious signs of trauma or infection at the time. He followed up with this Dentist and it was suggested he likely had a chemical burn secondary to citrus foods. He followed up with another provider and was treated with a 3 day course of an antiviral medication for herpes without any change in symptoms. He hasn&#39;t had oral herpes before, but has had shingles.  He received his second Moderna vaccine on 3/25/2021 and 3 days later developed significant throat pain and swelling in his neck glands that was visible to him. His symptoms improved slightly, but have never completely resolved. He has had what feels like a dry sore throat for 7-8 weeks and intermittent white patches in the back of his mouth. He has no history of or active allergy symptoms. Was treated for oral candidiasis on 4/19/2021, but it&#39;s unclear if his vaccine triggered these symptoms.

Day 1-4 post vaccine, 8-9 out of 10 pain when moving or attempting to move my arm.  It&#39;s been 2 wks post vaccine, and my shoulder, although less weak, still hurts (~3-6 out of 10 depending on time of day and activity) and is still weak (perhaps 50-70% of normal).

                                                I received a shot on 7 April. A couple of days later, I received a phone call from a health facility stating, vials of the vaccine were stored outside of the temperature range recommended by Moderna, which affects the viability. The person on the phone recommended I get another 1st dose. On April 21 (2 weeks later) I received a second 1st dose, and I experienced strong side effects. Yesterday morning I had a 103-degree temperature, chills, dizziness and weakness, along with tremendous muscle pain in the injection area. Also, the injection area has a bright red circle and is hot to the touch. I said to the vaccine administrator that the injection did not feel similar to the first one because it hurt going in. She responded with that the worst part, and now it&#39;s over.

He does not have a PCP and presented to the student clinic twice and was given samples of diphenhydramine and urged to seek immediate med treatment since we are a student only clinic. Pt did not seek care but reported to me by phone that Benadryl helped the itching which only subsided one month after it began.

                                                On day 3 after the vaccine was given I had a local area of redness two inched wide develop. It gradually faded and went away, then after being completely gone for 3-4 days, on 1/11/21 another red blotch developed in the exact same spot, slightly bigger (2.5 &#34;) and a darker color (dark pink vs light pink). It is indurated like a positive TB test but bigger. there is no pain, no itching, and I otherwise feel well. I just thought it was odd to have the pink area completely go away then come back a few days later more intensely. I wanted to report it in case this helps people at the CDC better understand the vaccine side effects. I stopped getting texts from the Vsafe app after having several days of no side effects.

Symptoms persisted for apx. two more days and was treated with topical rub, massage, and ibuprofen.

I was yelling at my wife and children.  This is very out of character for me and woke up this morning and had trouble recalling all the events of the previous night until my wife informed me of them.

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At approximately 9:30 PM (14 hours after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna), I started with chills and being cold. At the same time, I started a fever that gradually went up to 102.2 by 3:30 AM (20 hours after receiving 2nd dose). Also noticed a headache. At 3:30 AM I did take 2 extra strength Tylenol caplets.  Fever went down, but I did notice even 24-36 hours after receiving 2nd dose, my temperature was at 99.5-99.9.  The headache remained 24-36 hours but has since subsided now at 48 hours after receiving. I do still feel mild fatigue, but I reported to work without any issues. I did notice that my arm was hardly even sore compared to 1st dose received on Feb. 6, 2021.  One week after my 1st dose on Feb. 6, I developed the COVID rash which lasted 2-3 days and went away w/o any medication.   All in all, I did not find the side effects to be bad for either dose. I would do it all over again. The side effects were more of a nuisance than anything. I would have honestly reported to work as normal if it was during the week when I received vaccine. The side effects were not that bad.

                                                On evening of initial dose, I had a very sore Arm at the injection site. I feel that it was extremely different from what others describe. I could barely lift the arm without a lot of pain. I wasn&#39;t too worried about it as I knew it could only be sore for so long. It faded throughout the next days. On 04/07/21, I woke from a sleep at 4am and as I rolled over, I had a massive wave of dizziness come over me. I thought it was very strange so I decided to sit up, in bed. As soon as I sat up, the room started spinning. It felt as if I were drunk as a skunk. I managed to steady myself and got out of bed and went to the bathroom, all the while fighting the dizziness/vertigo. The dizziness/vertigo has prevailed since then, but at a diminished rate. It is better if I am up and moving and worse if I am sitting/laying around. I&#39;ve waited almost a week to file this VAER but feel like it needs to be done.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

Muscle soreness when I raised my arm above my shoulder. If I was going to examine someone for a rotator cuff injury - with the arm above that is where the soreness was. Nurse practitioner took picture of my hand that first day and the next day Dr looked at it. I had these symptoms for two weeks. My fingers are still kind of sore now. I had to try a few things to get the ring off my finger but otherwise no treatment.

                                                the next day, after being vaccinated, my left shoulder muscle (deltoid), right where the vaccine was administered, I felt a bit of a discomfort. and this lasted for about 3 days. after about 3 to 4 days after being vaccinated, &#34;all&#34; my muscles started to ache a bit, and I felt a bit weak. that passed after maybe 3 to 4 days. about 4 to 5 days later, or about 10 days after being vaccinated, the outside of my left arm (where the vaccine was administered) felt strangely over sensitive; to a touch and temperature. for the most part that has subsided now. However, about 4 days ago (a little over 2 weeks after being vaccinated) my left arm feels a bit weird. the feeling is similar to a mildly pinched nerve. for instance, if you sit for sometime with an arm at a weird position, (maybe twisted), you can get a weird feeling, of a bit of a discomfort. not the one where your arm goes numb, but a bit &#34;uncomfortable&#34;. but that typically goes away after a couple of minutes after you get up and start moving your arm. Well, this is the feeling now, except that it&#39;s been like that for the past 4 days or so. However, no outside reactions, no skin discoloration, etc.  I spoke with a nurse, and she advised me to report this side effect, and to make appointment with my PCP if the symptom does not subside in the next few days.

Also noticed little blood spots showing up on skin on chest, legs, arms. very small, raised, and probably around 20-30 on whole body.

No other pain the day of injection. Day after injection (approximately 18 hours later) the entire right arm ached; then the aching moved to the lower back and eventually both legs. Pain resolved at approximately 30 hours after injection; ache never affected left (non-injected) arm.  Minor headache seemed to be forming, but never progressed past the initial indications. Was extremely tired the day following the injection; took two naps (1-2 hours each) and slept 12 hours that night (i.e., injected Friday, tired all day Saturday and slept longer than normal Saturday night). Aside from soreness at injection point, no further signs/symptoms on Sunday (i.e., resolved around 36 hours after injection).

The area was 1 ½ wide and it was in all my arm. It was itchy, burned, and painful. I went to the emergency room. The doctor said that my infection was due to the vaccine and gave me antibiotics for 10 days. After 10 days my arm was brown. No need to go back to the doctor but I still have the brownish line in my arm.

Started having &#34;hypersensitivity&#34; in shoulder, cervical, head, and into left arm.  The hypersensitivity progessed and got worse, on 1/13 blisters started developing on left  upper shoulder region and progressed to cervical region to occiput region and into left shoulder.  Went to clinic and have shingles.  1/19 the hypersensitivity in left arm has decreased but injection site has started to be &#34;sore&#34; again.  Still having shingle type symptoms in left shoulder/cervical region.

These feelings lasted until 10pm on 1/16/21, and then I went to bed and felt better in the morning.  I was barely able to get out of bed that day (1/16) because of how sick I felt.  Besides the sick feeling,  I had bad pain at the injection site, and had a 3cm x 3cm raised red lump at the injection site.  This stayed painful for 48-60 hours, then the swelling subsided and was left with a bruise.

                                                Flu like symptoms- started with fatigue, then chills slightly elevated. Temp, nausea, joint pain, aches, not much of an appetite but still ate.  Tylenol and Benadryl took care of it fairly well.  Had arm pain at site of injection, like I was hit in arm with a baseball bat.  Had some gerd too but not sure if related. Tiredness started around 9 hours after the shot, but symptoms really kicked in about 12 hours after administration.  Lasted till about 46 hours after administration, at which time I woke up from overnight sleep feeling great.  Arm still sore and there might be some lingering joint pain but nothing to keep me from doing anything.

                                                The day after the vaccination, I woke up with atypically cold and discolored red violet hands to wrists, lasting about six days. Irregular heart rhythm and breathing especially during sleep. Intense headaches for roughly 8 days, high blood pressure. Roughly days 4,5,6, being the worst for the headaches, blood pressure and rhythm.  Also, day 8 and 9 after the vaccination, sudden red spot on left arm, site of injection appeared, being itchy. Diminished day 10.   Day five and six  I was very concerned with out of synch breathing, headaches and high blood pressure.  Hands still flashes of being cold, and less severe headaches.

Got epi 0.3 mg IM, Decadron 10 mg IV, Zyrtec 10 mg, Pepcid 40 mg po, Benadryl 25 mg po, with improvement.  Allergy consulted, felt this was likely delayed hypersensitivity reaction to Moderna, but couldn&#39;t exclude lisinopril side effect.  They recommended Zyrtec 10 mg bid for 1 wk, and stay off lisinopril.  Will follow up in Clinic to determine how to approach 2nd shot.

                                                I was scheduled to receive my second shot on February 19, 2001. However, due to the winter storm that hit I was not able too. The next week is when red bumps appeared all over my body from arms, legs, back, and chest. The clinic called for me to reschedule my second shot and I declined because of the rash. I waited another week hoping things would clear up but they never did. I proceeded to schedule an appointment with my primary care physician Dr. He treated it for scabies and gave me a prescription cream to use. After using the cream, nothing improved. I called doctor back and he referred me to a dermatologist. I have been waiting for almost a month now to see a dermatologist. In the meantime, I am still experiencing extreme itching and red bumps all over my body. Please help.

                                                Initially, I felt fatigued and my left deltoid was sore. On day three after vaccination, I had one episode of hematuria. On day 4, I developed a fever and chills. On day 5, I developed dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency and hesitancy. I have also had some low back pain and purulent urine. I have never had any urinary or prostate issues in the past and have regular annual physical exams. I am an emergency physician and had to work, so I started myself on Bactrim DS (I am avoiding floroquinolones due to numerous black box warnings). I have had several other episodes of hematuria during my treatment. I am on day 13 of Bactrim and my symptoms are improving. I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I have never had any similar issues and thought this should be reported.

My fever, uncontrollable shivering, and profuse body aches persisted for 14 hours until my fever broke at approximately 5 pm the day following my vaccination.  The redness, swelling, and pain in my upper arm  continues to persist; although, it has improved.

Nest day woke up with severe pain in left arm from below the site of injection (upper triceps) region down to the elbow , got severe enough to not be able straighten my arm fully without major discomfort.  Took Advil 800 mg , that made it better but not completely. By evening time felt like i was tired and like what i feel like when i am about to get a cold.   Next day was not tired , feeling of getting sick was no longer there and pain got slightly better by midday.   Next day after that woke up with slight swelling in the site and the arm was red and was warm to touch.  That continued for 2 days and gradually got less red and swollen and started to itch.  Took almost a week for the itch to completely subside.

                                                I had my second injection on Sunday morning 1/24/21 at 9:00 AM.  I was fine through the day.  The previous dose (dose #1) was on 12/29/20 and I became symptomatic the following day.  I had aches, malaise and fevers of 102.7 on 12/30/20.  The fevers lasted approximately 12 hours and resolved with Tylenol.  My left deltoid was very swollen and quite painful.  The swelling and pain resolved within 24 hours after the first injection.

I had a vey difficult time walking and was quite dizzy through the night.  Unable to sleep more than a couple of minutes at a time.  By 6:45 am, my fever was around 103.5.  I have used Tylenol and Ibuprofen since 1/25/21, 6:45 am.  both medications have been utilized around the clock on TID basis.  Fever dissipated by 1/25/21 evening.  Only a mild headache is present.  The injection site was swollen, indurated and painful to touch similar to cellulitis.  I have not used antibiotics, drew a line and have monitored the redness, it is slowly resolving.    By 17:30 on 1/26/21, I have a mild headache, mild malaise and chills.  No fever.  Arm is still swollen red and hot.

At 22 h after the vaccine I could not abduct my arm due to the local pain, became prostrated (had to lay down all day), lost appetite (only ate 2 cookies all day) and became very fatigued (went to sleep at night at 7 pm instead of my 10 pm regular sleeping time). I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence.

                                                I experienced acute arm pain after injection that subsided within 48-72 hours.  Last night, on day 8, after five&#43; days of no pain whatsoever, and through the night to today (day 9) I am again experiencing acute arm pain similar to  the worst pain I felt in the days after the injection, both at the injection site and radiating down my arm and into my shoulder.  I took Tylenol which has provided some relief, but my range of arm motion is still limited by sharp pain.

                                                Two days after the injection on Wednesday, red spots began to appear on the neck from Friday. From the evening it began to spread to the chest and legs. Saturday got worse, so itching in my neck and chest. The eyes were swollen and the double eyelid disappeared. On Sunday, my eyes were swollen and pus started to form from the red spots. On Monday, I couldn&#39;t go to work because my eyes were so swollen, and my skin became dry and itchy.

No rashes or other side effects noted on 2/24/21 01:54 Nursing Progress Note, but 2/24/21 12:01 Nursing Progress Note stated ?There is a purple discoloration/rash/splotches on his arms and legs that PCP came to assess this morning?. PCP noted in retrospect, a similar event happened soon after his 1st vaccine dose - he received his first COVID-19 vaccine dose 1/26/21 at 13:00.  Nursing Progress note from 1/27/21 at 18:05, stated patient was transfered to ER for ??cool clammy skin and discoloration all over body?? (he was admitted for UTI, so it was thought his clammy discolored skin was associated with this acute illness) - He recovered from this first event without issue.

I wrapped it today in ace bandage and am using a cane. I am very upset. I have done nothing and this is all since the last shot.

                                                On the evening of 04/01/2021 I noticed a sudden itching sensation in my right arm and when I scratched it discovered the area to be swollen.  Upon self examination I found the area be swollen in a disc shape approx 3 inches across and 1/2 to 3/4 inches deep. It is feverish to the touch.  This is a sudden presentation.  The area was not swollen or feverish earlier in the day.  An online searh found tht &#39;Covid arm&#39; seems to describe the symptoms and I intend to take Tylenol if necessary.

He is not a regular patient of the health center and he was instructed by staff on duty to contact his PCP or go to Urgent Care for treatment. I have attempted to reach the patient by phone multiple times but have been unable to reach him and have not had a return call. It is unknown if he has actually been examined by a doctor or other health care professional as in question #21.

                                                Muscular soreness in injection site starting a couple/few hours after injection, persisting 30 hours later. Soreness is not extraordinary. It is no worse than soreness from a workout and it radiates out no greater than 2 inches from injection site. No noticeable discoloration of the skin near the injection site. No rash. Starting in the morning prior to afternoon vaccination I developed a headache. I drank caffeine and a lot of water so I presume it was not caffeine withdrawal or dehydration.  The night before I moved a large number of heavy boxes in my garage.  Pain appeared to originate in back of neck, likely muscle strain induced headache. I did not want to take advil prior to the vaccination.  After surviving the day with a headache I took two advil (normal adult dosage) around 7pm or so. Last night around 8pm - 8:30pm (approximately 5 - 5 1/2 hours after injection) I began feeling the onset of a low grade fever.  Confirmed low grade fever using digital thermometer in both ears/multiple readings.  Low temperature 99.0/high temperature 99.2. Low grade fever felt like it subsided after about an hour to hour and a half.  Did not retake temperature. Has not recurred. I AM PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION SOLELY TO PROVIDE DATA FOR THIS NEW VACCINE. ORDINARILY I WOULD NOT EXPECT TO REPORT SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

                                                He got the vaccine, started to get the headache within 45 minutes, ran some errands and after a couple of hours he felt like something was burning on his buttock, and noticed a really bad red rash on the left side on the left cheek from the crack outward. It was extremely hot to the touch and very sore, kind of throbbing and swollen and progressively got worse. He was just not feeling well, nauseous and dizzy and went to sleep but when he woke up it had spread to the other cheek. It looks like he got burned or scalded red/purple in color. He has no reaction on the arm itself, but only on the buttock and a blistery, blood red, leathery feeling rash/blotch on his entire buttock to both hips on both sides. It is difficult for him to sit. He also had headache, the muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea.  He did not vomit but had not eaten anything. He has had a high fever up to 103 until this morning 4/8/21 which is about 99-100.  He woke up soaking wet today. He has not been able to turn his neck, and not able to lift his arm above his waist level since the vaccine, and not able to turn his neck to the left at all. He can turn it 5-10 degrees, but right is okay. He took some Benadryl over the last 2 days for the reaction but it has not. He also has taken aspirin/Aleve for the fever. He was so sock and had no energy and could not sleep but could not keep his eyes open either, was not able to open them. He did write his doctor when the rash was only on one side, which they did not give him any advice as he was not feeling any worse at that time. He was at 101 fever throughout the day and then at night went to 102. He was hoping that the rash would be better, but actually worse as described above. He has not had any appetite, trying to drink fluids but made him nauseous, and he normally drinks water all day long. His normal temp is 97.7. He has been taking showers to try and keep his fevers down and the water hitting the rash feels like somebody is pouring scolding water on it. He did call Moderna on 4/6/21 asking if this was a reaction that anybody has reported, and he is waiting for somebody to call him back.

On 3/23/21, woke up with severe chest pains and collapsed, large gash on my head, taken to hospital by ambulance.  Dr&#39;s did not think it was from 2nd dose, but they could not find another reason for Syncope and collapse.

                                                Received the vaccine shot at 10:30 in the morning. That same night at 9 PM became tired and started shaking. Had violent chills and hot episodes. Woke up at 2:15 AM and couldn?t move. My arms and hands and feet were completely paralyzed. Couldn?t speak or call out. Slowly started attempting to move fingers and feet and head. After several minutes was able to roll over on stomach. Could not move. After several minutes of attempting movement was able to push myself up and grab a piece of furniture. After several more minutes was able to get legs to move sufficiently to walk to bathroom by holding onto furniture and leaning against walls and door jams. Still feeding feeling feverish with chills. My son took my temperature with a forehead scanning thermometer and it registered at 100.3. He said my skin felt extremely hot. Took 1000 mg acetaminophen.  Finally was able to go back to sleep around 4 AM and slept for a couple more hours. Woke up just before 7 AM and was able to stand and walk with some effort. Currently 9:30 AM and still have aches and pains and difficulty walking.

I went to my regular Dr and said I need it looked by a dermatologist. I went to see him he said it?s vasculitis and gave me steroids. I took it and went away. Then I went to take my 2nd shot and then few days after I got red bumps on my feet but worse this and dermatologist said I need to see a rheumatologist which I did and they drew blood work and and car scans for chest and kidneys make sure vasculitis was not internal.  The rash is still on my feet I am going to see rheumatologist tomorrow April 16th to discuss what I can take to make this red bumps go away that spread all over my legs and now spreading on my stomach. All the Dra I seen can?t verify or say it?s the vaccine that caused this but the timing they say when it happened it same time when vaccine was taken.

This is the same arm he had the vaccination in. This gradually improved but did not resolve prior to time of second vaccination 2/27/21. Subsequent to this rash increased and persisted. No treatment but patient sent photographs via secure email. He was seen for follow-up on 4/15/21 and still had very mild erythema but no itching to the area.

My left shoulder and neck are cramping (up to my ear) and raising my arm is painful.  Even my left knee is bothering me.  The amount of discomfort is surprising.  I had none of these symptoms prior to the injection.

I will say that I am not sure this is related to the shot but wanted to report it as it is different from any other skin reactions I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s been three weeks now and it still itches and burns as much as it did three weeks ago.  I have tried applying Triamcinolone Acetonide .1% steroid cream which does help.  I have also tried antibiotic ointment covered by bandages overnight (no effect), Eucerin (no effect), and Aquaphor (no effect).

There was no rash that presented below the waist. The rash was accompanied by a low-grade fever of 99 to 100 Fahrenheit and lasted for over an hour from the time the adverse event presented.  Once the low-grade fever dissipated, the rash symptoms and low-grade fever dissipated as well.

Rash is still noticeable on both arms but less irritating. I had minor psoriasis on leg that seemed to get worse after 2nd shot.  Also within the last 10 day I fell and got 2 minor cuts on my arms. Usually, my cuts heals very quickly, but the 2 cuts I received did not heal fast. They were slow to heal and almost leaking puss. Overall, I feel my skin is slowly healing after any issue with cuts or rashes or minor psoriasis. In addition there were times up to the last week where I would feel very tired around midnight and just had to go to sleep. I normally don&#39;t go to sleep till after 12:30AM, but I was so I tired that I would be in bed by 12:00AM.

Starting on day 9, developing splotchy rashes filled with pus along the edge of left hand, towards bottom of the palm. Looks like shingles. Had chicken pox as a child. Had these Shingles- like outbreaks before in the past, but usually on the right side (same area, right hand). Willtry antihistamines next.

                                                Patient got his Covid vaccine this past Thursday, 2 days ago.  He experienced typical side effects of a sore left shoulder and some fatigue but was feeling well until this afternoon around 1:55 PM when he noticed throbbing of his left hand.  He looked down and noticed that there was a purple discoloration to his middle finger and distal palmar aspect of his hand.  He felt like there was maybe some swelling as well and that he might have been having an allergic reaction so called the emergency department for further advice and came in for evaluation.  By the time I arrived to the emergency department the patient&#39;s left hand was no longer swollen and there was only a small purple discoloration to the palmar proximal middle finger.  I was concerned that the patient developed a small blood clot that was resolved upon evaluation.

On a scale from one to ten, the level of discomfort was seven or eight. I had expected at least some soreness as I normally have soreness after receiving flu shots and other injections. However, I was very surprised as to how sore my arm really was. Fortunately, when I woke up the next day, January 10th, the pain had mostly subsided, with just a little swelling evident at the injection site.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

On the morning of January 13, 2021 I woke with a red rash going up the inside of both arms and around the outside of my upper arms and down my entire back.  As the day has progressed that rash has spread down the back of legs as well.  I did take one Benadryl with minimal effect.

Did not think too much of it at first, however the area grew a little and swelled up.  Consulted with my doctor and they diagnosed Shingles.  Am currently prescribed Valtrex for shingles.

I completely removed my shirt to assure proper placement.  Common soreness to shot experienced next two days after administration, however soreness felt in shoulder joint rather than muscle. Pain re-occurred on 1/12/21 and has not been totally relieved despite the usage of anti-inflammatory medication eg. Ibuprofen 400mg,  Tylenol 500mg along with Ibuprofen for soreness. The worst pain I experience is when I go to sleep being prematurely awaken by aching and throbbing to my affected area. Again, not being any discomfort to muscle but rather left shoulder joint pain where sometimes I am discouraged from raising my left arm to my side. It does not bother me so much to raise my left arm towards my front. I have been working through my discomfort while being very careful not to aggravating it further. My concern comes from the fact that it has not completely gone away after the extended time frame and becomes more intense in the evening.

The day after the injection fatigue was debilitating requiring sleeping or resting for most of the day and night. Half way through the second day after the injection fatigue is still present though significantly improved. The Item 21 box for Doctor visit has been checked as I will meet with my primary care provider as soon as possible and have already discussed it with my employer&#39;s health department.

The patient developed headache, lack of taste, fatigue as well as the aforementioned rash on 1/14/2021(6 days after receiving first dose of covid vaccine.  A rapid covid test was positive on 1/14/2021 also.  The patient was prescribed claritin, methylprednisolone for the rash after seeing his family physician virtually and the family physician recommended he contact where he was vaccinated to report these symptoms.  I have reached out to the patient for additional information and he has declined, so I do not have any access to details on his positive covid test or records from that virtual encounter.

Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

Symptoms began approximately 24 hours after receiving the second vaccine, and gradually subsided over the following 24 hours, with only moderate diarrhea, heart palpitations, and fatigue remaining. It was by far the worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to a vaccine The only side effects after the first vaccine were moderate fatigue the evening of the vaccine and moderate arm pain.

                                                At about 4:00 or 4:30, I broke out in hives on my arms, inner thighs - legs, back, stomach - I called my health care provider and she had me take a Benadryl, on Sunday these were going away. At 5:00 pm, I got out of work, I went straight home because I felt so weak and my eyes got watery (didn&#39;t go to work out afterward) and I got the chills and my bones started to hurt, I went to bed and slept all - my bones were in horrific pain - especially in my back. Saturday morning, I felt the same -I took OTC med for the pain - no fever; body aches, watery eyes and I was very weak. I drank orange juice and I took some Zinc; vitamin C - and I hurt all that day - bones still achy but not quite as much. Sunday morning, I wasn&#39;t normal but better and by Sunday noon I was better; not weak anymore. On a scale from one to 10, I felt like a ten when it was bad. My injection site was sore for a good four days. I took it on a Friday but Tuesday the arm was good to go.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

                                                I definitely had a soreness at the injection site, more than I have had with any other shot. It definitely subsided after a couple of days. Also had joint pain in my hands, elbows, and knees, and particularly in my left knee where I have arthritis, also decreased in intensity within a few days of the shot.   About a week after the shot, my arm began to itch at the injection site, and swelling and a half-dollar sized red patch appeared, and the skin was hot to the touch. Today (2 days later), the red patch is roughly the size of a small envelope. The skin is still warm or hot to the touch and the swelling may have subsided slightly. I am not taking any antihistamines or using any topicals- just working on not scratching the area. I have read some info on the internet referring to this as &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. It is manageable, and I am NOT deterred from getting my second shot in April.

Over the next 40 minutes I needed to urinate 6 additional times, and my heart rate peaked out at 195 BPM, and BP of 139/84. My blood oxygen never went below 95. My hands and feet were extremely cold, but normal in color. After approximately an hour after I recorded the peak heart rate, my rate was 138 BPM. By about 8:45 AM, I was very close to mo normal heart rate and BP. I had no other notable symptoms other than the expected soreness at the injection site and a very slight headache.

He also felt like having a fever but he did not. One week later, patient started to get painful blisters on his leg. He went to his doctor and was diagnosed with shingles. Patient was prescribed an antiviral and gabapentin for pain. It took a week for the pain to resolve and the blisters are now clearing. Patient heard from one of his friends that there have been some shingles cases that were reported with the Covid vaccines. So he called us to report the adverse event.

                                                I track my blood sugar 3x per day (morning, an hour after lunch, an hour after dinner).  Blood sugar is very well controlled using insulin - fasting blood sugar is consistently 115-125, sometimes varying to 110-130.  When I got the second Covid shot, my fasting blood sugar the next two days were 147 and 143 - the highest values I have EVER recorded since I started taking insulin (earlier this year).  Correspondingly, the values after lunch and dinner yesterday were very elevated.  This afternoon and evening, the numbers have returned to normal, and I expect tomorrow morning&#39;s fasting value to be back around 120 again.  This was not dangerous, but as an engineer, I found it to be a fascinating and statistically significant  outlier.  The other symptoms I had from the second shot was a fever (over 100 degrees from 11/28 5:30pm through 11/30 8am, and over 102 from 11/28 10pm through 11/29 9am), some general aches and fatigue, and injection site soreness.  I had no adverse reaction to the first shot (a month earlier) except for injection site soreness.

Baseline plt 74 at admission. Rivaroxaban 10mg PO QD was given 4/19/21 until 4/21/21. Plt count continued to downtrend during admission. Hematology/Oncology service consulted on 4/22/21 who initially suggested thrombocytopenia possibly due to infection or DIC. Yet, worsening thrombocytopenia despite improvement of infection and clinical status was noted. The etiology was then suggested to be Vancomycin induced thrombocytopenia, so Vancomycin was stopped on 4/22/21. Platelet count  Patient was discharged with p.o. prednisone and p.o. Levaquin on 4/27/21. Patient stated almost full resolution of LLE pain and redness. Plt count upon discharge was 51. Instructed to stop Rivaroxaban.  5/1/21:Patient presented to ER at Medical Center for Leg pain. US Doppler was negative and patient given Clindamycin IV 600mg in the ER and discharged with Bactrim 800mg qd to be continued until his PCP appointment.

Antibiotics were changed later to Tefalo 600mg Q12Hto be started on 5/15/21. ID consult recommended Daptomycin given patient&#39;s thrombocytopenia. Patient was continued on Daptomycin throughout admission and upon discharge, patient&#39;s leg was almost back to baseline. Plt count was 138. To rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia, patient medications were reviewed and imaging was done in addition to labs drawn during this admission. See above for the labs. All alternative causes during this admission were ruled out.

                                                About 8 hours after my second shot, I developed a fever, headache and body ache. Those symptoms and general tiredness lasted about 36 hours and then vanished. Then, about two weeks after my second Moderna shot, the injection site (upper left arm) was itchy. There is now a red spot around the site, about 1-2 cm wide at the moment (17 days after). No pain.

                                                Client received the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, he was escorted to the observation area. At the end of his 15-minute observation period, he reported hives on his left forearm. He denied pruritis or any other symptoms. His left forearm had about 10 small red raised hives, separated by an inch. He was directly observed by a nurse for an additional 15 minutes. In that time, the hives subsided nearly completely. The client was advised to closely monitor for any recurring or additional symptoms in the next 1-4 hours. The client was instructed to check in with his medical provider for discussion and further assessment of this mild reaction, in the context of his diagnosed allergy to dust, and determination if he should receive a 2nd dose. In the meantime, he has been added to the list for referral to a hospital for potential vaccination with a 2nd dose.

I could smell soaps/mint/fragrant lotions etc, if I sniffed it up close, but I could not taste anything. I tested this with several different  types of food.  This lasted until about 12:30 pm that day.  When I ate lunch I could taste my food again.   This was a strange event for me. I have never lost my sense of taste before.  2.  The evening of the third day after receiving the first dose of the moderna COVID-19 vaccine I experienced an approximate 4 inch diameter redness and itching around the injection site on my left shoulder.  There was also an itchy rash that extended across my chest and back to my right shoulder.  I took an antihistamine and went to bed.  When I awoke the next day the rash extending across my chest, back, and right shoulder was gone.  However, my left shoulder still  itched for the rest of that day.  The itchiness was gone when I awoke the next day.

                                                Patient had moderna covid vaccine last week. Initially he had normal post vaccine effects - soreness in the upper arm, fatigue. Over the weekend those symptoms were practically gone. Then he developed severe pain in the arm at the site of the injection followed by nausea and sweats. He is soaking thru his clothes. Not eating much. No fever, cough, sob. Just feels bad.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

Some hive are also apparent on my left hand and wrist.  I contacted my doctor Sunday 2-14-21 as the rash and itching were not being controlled by benadryl and hydroctorisone cream.  My doctor gave me Prednisone to take 60mg daily for 5 days.  I am now on day 2 of therapy and the rash on my back has gone down some, the rash on my right wrist and hand are still severe.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 31 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unspecified date, the patient experienced fever, chills, abdominal pain, anorexia/lack of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue/frequently had to lay in bed, and cellulitis on his left shin and foot. The patient took paracetamol and naproxen for the events, which somewhat helped.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, fever, chills, abdominal pain, anorexia/lack of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue/frequently had to lay in bed, were considered resolved on an unknown date. The outcome for the event, cellulitis on his left shin and foot, was reported as not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. Cellulitis of shin and foot is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                7pm on date of injection I got very sleepy and fell asleep.  I woke up at 12:45am sweating but chilled to the bone.  I felt feverish but was too cold to get out of bed.  When I actually got out of bed I had a very intense headache, and body aches.  I took my temp and it registered 104.  at 8am I took my dogs out but felt very old, chilled to the bone &amp;  lightheaded.  It was chilly outside.  I got back inside and got back into bed as fast as I could. The second I laid down, the sweat just poured out of my body, drenching my shirt, sheets, and blanket.  The fever lasted all day but was slowly improving throughout the day.  My arm was also incredibly sore at the injection site.  It was very sore for shot one too but the pain lasted nearly 2 weeks the first time and is already just about gone now.  Yesterday, or 2 days after dose 2 injection, the fever was gone.  I still had a headache, and body aches but also developed nausea.  I did not vomit but I did have diarrhea.  I also noticed extreme shortness of breath over very minor exertion.  I?m not sure if this was due to extreme dehydration , due to loss of fluids or if it?s associated with the vaccine.  My lungs feel clear and I deny ever suffering from a bronchial spasms..  Day 3 I?m feeling more myself but am still suffering from gastric upset.  Nausea has dissipated.

Subsided in a day and then a slight painful (like a sunburn feeing) point which seemed to be on a lymph node site near collar bone for a couple days. Then on the seventh day, redness and swelling on upper chest in same area. Got worse for two days then began to get better. Spot grew initially but then stopped growing. Slightly itchy, slightly painful, and very warm on second day.

                                                One month after my second dose I have started to have nerve pain in the immediate area around the injection site. This area had been pain free since about one week after the second shot.  As of now the pain is ongoing. It got worse for about 2 days and has remained the same since without improvement.  The pain is manageable and not bad enough that I feel need of medication. But I am concerned about it and wondering if others are reporting similar events, and if so, what is a common recovery timeline.

                                                I don&#39;t think that my reaction to the vaccine is super serious but it is perhaps worth noting if others are also experiencing similar symptoms. On the second day, I did have the expected arm soreness around the injection area on my right arm. That soreness faded by Saturday morning. However, on Saturday afternoon, I began experiencing some intermittent pain in my left kidney. I have had a few (3?) kidney stones since I was approximately 35 years old so it is a pain that I recognize almost immediately.  I kept my spider senses awake to see where it was going to go. About an hour later, I had intermittent &#34;flu like&#34; pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn&#39;t seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out. I cannot 100% say that any of these symptoms are related to the vaccine. However, being a Type 1 diabetic (since 1978) and the unusual kidney pain made me go, &#34;huh.&#34; That is why I am providing this info in the event that there are others who are experiencing similar symptoms that can be tied to the vaccine and what to expect. I feel completely fine now. Yay. :)

                                                -Sore arm:  started about 2 hours after injection.  By 18 hours after, it felt like I had a really bad bruise there.  It was throbbing always, more painful to stretch the deltoid where the shot was given, and sharply painful if I used that muscle to lift my arm.  This continued until about 30 hours when it started to reduce in intensity until being gone about 60 hours (2.5 days) after the shot. -General lethargy:  started about 6-7 hours after shot.   Peaked about 24 hours.  Still able to get up and move around but very tired.  Gone at about 43 hour mark. -Body aches:  timeframes the same as lethargy.  Felt at worst like a bad flu. - Headache and lightheadedness:  Started about  2 hours after injection.  Never got really bad, but was fairly consistently there until about 36 hour mark. - Burning eyes: started about 7 hours after shot, was annoying and lasted until about 33 hour mark. - Coughing:  mild but distinct dry cough started about 18 hours after shot and lasted to about 30 hour mark.

                                                After one week of taking the first shot, I feel the area of the injection spot being firm or stiff, hot, red, paining and itchy. It has been one full day of this symptom. I read it online and saw that it may be COVID arm but in my case, it seems to be milder. It feels like I developed muscle where the injection was administered.

                                                Almost entire right arm became very sore about an hour after the first injection. Took Ibuprofen which helped some. Next day only the upper part of right arm was sore, although not as sore as the previous day. Still took Ibuprofen. The third day only a little sore around the injection site. After 4th day, soreness was gone. No longer took Ibuprofen.

                                                I felt one small tingle in my left hand (I am right-handed) and I had a funny taste in my mouth.  Later that night, after eating, I started feeling a tingling sensation in my arms and back. It seemed to get worse after I ate some oatmeal cookies cooked with flour shortly before bed. Early the next morning, the tingling developed into itchy skin on my back, shoulders, and arms.  I am not really breaking out and I am making sure to stay hydrated.  I am hypothesizing that the side effects I am experiencing may be due to consuming refined flour and refined sugars that my body cannot metabolize.  At least for now, I plan to stay away from refined sugars and flours until my 2nd dose of the Moderna shot.  Day 2: I woke up on my left side and the pinky and ring fingers on my left hand were asleep. I went back to sleep on my back and woke up with fingers on my left and right side asleep. As I got ready for work, I experienced trapezius muscle soreness.

                                                Got his vaccine, that evening he felt as if his face was on fire like a windburn.  The next morning had an incredible cold chill as soon as air hit him, bone shaking.  Then had cold chills/sweating with soaking of his groin area.  He can go to sleep with extreme chills and then wake up in a puddle of sweat.  He had a headache at first, took Tylenol and it went away.   Numbness in his foot like it&#39;s falling asleep, left hip hurting, left wrist pain.  Today both calves hurt./sore like workout burning pain.  Two days ago his father went to have bypass and was at the hospital with him, and walked painfully in but had difficulty hobbling along and was unable to walk back to his truck and had to borrow his dad&#39;s cane to be able to walk.  Yesterday he was going to cut the grass, knelt down to do something, and when trying to stand up was not able to walk due to the throbbing pain and had to use the cane again.  Also having swollen left ankle with discoloration.  The calf pain is extreme and throbbing, and the pain when he&#39;s not able to walk is in the calf.  The ankle has been swollen since Sunday, 4/18/21.  He spoke with the ICU nurse in the hospital and he told her about it and she grabbed his ankle and asked if he was sure he didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  He has not been able to shake the symptoms.  The issues with walking are intermittent, some days he can walk fine, the other days he has to use the cane.    He still continues with every day hot sweats/cold chills.  It&#39;s 74 where he is right now and has a sweatshirt on as he is cold.  Also the legs hurting, ankle swelling that he ices down at night but the swelling does not go away.  Feels like a hard knot in his ankle.   He has not sought any treatment for this at this point.

                                                First dose on 3/5/2021 received with minor issues of slight pain in injection site later, but also some tingling in injection site. SECOND DOSE on 4/2/2021 was a different story.  About 15 hours later at 3:00 am I woke up with 100.5 fever, SEVERE pain at injection site (like someone had punched me in the arm and bruised my arm), and SEVERE level 9 (out of 10) pain in all joints in my hand and two big toes.  Fibromyalgia muscular pain SEVERE level 9.  Headache, SEVERE fatigue - could not get out of bed very well.  SEVERE brain fog - I could barely think logically.  I tried taking 50mg full spectrum CBD oil to avoid taking an NSAID (I was concerned it would affect proper immune response).  At 6:29 am the fever was lower, but I could no longer take the pain, so I took 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil).  4-6 hours later took another 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil) and stayed in bed and slept several times that day.  For the next two days the severe brain fog and severe fatigue remained.  I continued to take 400mg Advil as needed.  The brain fog was so severe that if I picked up my keys (or any other object), I would immediately ?lose? them and not know where they were because I had placed them somewhere else and could not remember anything.  I stayed home for at least 72 hours due to the fatigue and the fear of driving and possibly getting in an accident.  It seems the high severity of the issues lasted 72 hours, but all of the above reported issues continued for several weeks at a lower severity - with fatigue being the worst - requiring one or two naps per day.  As of today, April 29, there is still slight pain in all hand joints and some fatigue, but there seems to be gum issues (hurting) since about April 26th.  I am brushing my teeth lightly, using ?Smart Mouth? zinc oral rinse, and sucking/chewing on a whole clove every once in a while for pain relief and for the anti-biotic properties.  I did not contact my physician because I read online that people with Fibromyalgia have worse side effects and I figured the effects would subside over time.  I have an upcoming appointment with my doctor on May 26, 2021 at which time I will report these side effects and my strong concern about any future booster shots and the severe side effects I may encounter.

                                                Skin rash starting on lower left leg 6 days after injection. Telemedicine doctor incorrectly diagnosed rash as Shingles. Rash gets progressively worse for 4 more days and appears on right leg with less severity. Primary doctor diagnoses as bacterial skin infection and prescribed oral antibiotic. Rash continues to get worse covering most of back of right leg and ankle swelling appears. Went back to primary for Antibiotic injection. 3-4 days later rash began improving. Slow and steady improvement for the next 5 weeks with second prescription of antibiotics. As of today 4/29 still small remnants of rash but healing continues. I had a bacterial skin infection 15 years ago and was given antibiotic injection and oral antibiotic. 48 hours later rash was dissipating, 5-6 days later rash/infection  was completely gone. This reaction 6 days after Moderna is still present 6 weeks after first appearance.

                                                When I woke It felt like a inner tube was inflated around my waist really tight and locked up where my back is fractured and the upper earlier surgery hurt and itched from nerve I am assuming. It settled in to all my weak spots. Today I have no pain like that in my back but right leg function and reflexes are nonfunctioning with spasms.

The next day more hives appeared on his chest and back. 2 days after shot hives were on forehead, chest, back, neck, forearms, legs. Some were flat and some were raised and blister like (some appeared like chicken pox). 3 days after shot hives (flat and blister like) covered his body including face except the groin area. He also had some redness to the whites of his eyes-he went to the emergency room. The hives were itchy, not painful. He did not experience any difficulty breathing. As of today he no longer has any blister like hives but does still have many red splotches left on his back and chest and arms-they are fainter but still present.

I had the following issues after my second dose (April 29, 2021):  Day 2 (April 30), 28 hours following injection, I experienced an internal feeling of ?jitteriness?, shortness of breath, and accelerated pulse. Pulse oximeter showed my oxygen saturation dropped to 92 percent (my normal is 98-99) and my resting pulse rate increased to 120 bpm (my normal varies from 66 to 75). Aforementioned symptoms subsided after 6 hours.  Day 3 (May 1) following injection, local swelling and pain in muscle at site of injection (upper left arm). Arm swelling and pain subsided by Day 7.) Day 4 (May 4), noticed two swollen lymph nodes (size of pea and small marble) near collar bone area of neck (same side as injection).  Day 31 (May 29), both lymph node swellings still exists (as of this reporting) though not as prominent.

                                                I experienced insidous onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations after approximately 2-3 minutes of inoculation.  This episode lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I was not expecting this having no prior history of adverse response to vaccines.  I also felt a flushing sensation in my head.   My breathing felt slightly more difficult.  No sweating, throat closure or itching.   I did not measure pulse and instead tried to breathe/meditate to bring it down.  I estimate it was about 140 bpm .  Breathing/meditation brought it down but it was still elevated when the nurse checked me after 20 minutes.  I remained onsite an additional 15 minutes until I felt well enough to leave but my heart rate was still somewhat elevated, about 20 bpm higher than my usual.   My heart rate seemed to fluctuate throughout the evening and my sleep was subsequently very poor.  I feel much better this morning, just the usual arm soreness after a vaccination.  I have reached out to my primary doctor concerning whether she feels this event would warrant my not getting the second dose or perhaps having a prescribed epipen on my person.  Having no personal history but a family history of severe heart disease (father had first MI at age 42, second at 44 followed by triple bypass and CHF) this incident with my heart rate certainly raised some anxiety.  I had a routine EKG done in June which was normal, I am a physical therapist and in good health.  I am hoping to have the next vaccine in a proper medical facility.   I have read CDC recommendations to not have the second shot if certain adverse responses are experienced and I am not certain whether this would qualify.   I have no history of adverse reactions to vaccines.    Considering the role of anxiety versus the insidious and nearly immediate onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations and persistent elevated heart rate for more than 12 hours, I feel this event was primarily driven by the vaccine.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                Did not notice until  January 13th, but there is about a one to one and  half inch length strip by 1/2 inch wide  of discoloration running anterior to the injection side of my arm, where it is slightly discolored. I would almost call it slightly jaundiced in color to a slight bruising in color.  The area is not sore to the touch, nor warm nor itchy. I noticed it perhaps last week around January 13th, so it could have been there longer.  No need for medical care nor intervention. Thought it might be worth reporting.  I have had bruising before from a vaccine or blood draw, and this length of discoloration is too long to be bruising.  I do not bruise easily nor have any type of coagulation disorder.

                                                I received shot in left arm.  I began getting sore in injection area which I expected.  At around 630 in the evening, I began to feel a sharp pain going down my left arm from middle of shoulder to the hand.  This especially happened when I raised my arm.  I kept my left arm down to side trying to slowly move it during the day.  I contact Hot line for Hospital and explained issues.  They described certain reasons but said that I could take Motrin.  I began taking Motrin every 4 hours.  The next day I was able to raise arm about half way. The pain became a dull and aching from shoulder to hand. I continue to take Motrin.

                                                My Left shoulder became red at the injection site and swollen.  I also have pain and stiffness going from the injection site all the way up to the base of my skull.  If I look down at my hands, my cell phone, the ground or even at a desk too long, the left side of my neck gets so stiff that it hurts to raise my head back up to normal height.  The muscles in my left shoulder and left side of my neck are so tight that it seems like I have been lifting weights for days.  I have not worked out in months.  Today is 1/23/21 and I still have the problem.   I also had a migraine headache for three to four days after the vaccine.

                                                I began with chills on Weds. morning around 10am that only got worse not matter what I did. My arm continued to hurt but I thought it was just the injection pain. I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit. Dr. feels this was and allergic reaction and recommends I do not get the second injection.

His wife noticed that he had discrete circular patches of hair missing from scalp as his wife is shorter she had not noticed before, until the 16th when he was going down the stairs in front of her. The spots are not puritic nor scaley consistent with other entities. Presentation is consistent with alopicia ereata though autoimmune can be brought on by immunization as has been demonstrated by the recombinant DNA Hep B immunization.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

                                                Received 2 dose Wednesday at 4:00 PM. By then next afternoon (Thursday) my arm was sore particularly at the injection sight at my left deltoid, with some diffuse soreness shoulder to elbow laterally.  By that same afternoon and evening I had chills and aches and started to feel run down.  That evening my temperature was slightly elevated around 99.3 degrees.  Some chills and aches, and feeling run down persisted the next morning (Friday) , I slept most of that morning and until 1::00 PM.  Mostly felt better by that evening and fine by the next day (Saturday).  The arms soreness also subsided by Saturday. As a side not with my first dose 4 weeks earlier my only symptom was soreness at the injection site for 3 days (more significant than I have experienced with other vaccines, including the flu vaccine.)

                                                I don&#39;t have lot number or dose number.  It was a Moderna COVID 19 vaccine.  I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

                                                about 7 to 10 days after Moderna shot, started to notice some petechia spots around both feet and working up legs. 10 days after spots started to developed on both forearms. Went to clinic and they did lab work-up to include PT/INR. CBC, BMP etc. all labs normal. Spots continued to grow with some starting to look like large healing bruising, nut never went away. Received second moderna shot on 2/2/21 and about 5 to 7 days after shot noticed an increase in blotchy spots to both legs and arms. I then had a visit with Dr. who ordered steroid cream, which had no effect on areas and was given referral to a dermatologist.   Spots then started to run from wrist on both arms up to biceps and from feet on both legs up to mid-thigh. I then start to have spots start on abdomen and in groin area. With some spots looking to irregular ringworm type marks. Dermatologist appointment was cancelled due to weather.

It doesn&#39;t burn as much today but is still puffy and red. I think the vaccine supercharged (for lack of a better word) the dermatitis.

                                                I had the usual symptoms immediately after the second dose: headache, site of injection pain, fever and body aches. Around Feb 12, I had some pain in my left nostril and over the course of a week or so it swelled and became very red and painful. I contacted my doctor by phone on Feb 19 and she prescribed Kephlex, Feb 20 I went to Urgent Care and they said I had cellulitis on my nose. They prescribed Augmentin and took a culture. Feb 21, I went to the Emergency because it was not getting any better, they prescribed Bactrim and sent me home. I missed two days of work and felt miserable for over a week. My nose still hurts today.

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

                                                About 15 minutes after my shot, I began to experience symptoms of an allergic reaction, similar to when I accidentally eat tree nuts. There was a tightness in my chest and a tingling of my lips. I brought this to the pharamacists&#39; attention, and they gave me Benadryl and had me wait at the pharmacy, after making me promise to let them know if things got worse. In the next 15 minutes or so, I experienced additional allergic reaction symptoms, including swelling of the tongue and an itchy rash (although these were relatively minor). About an hour after I got the shot, I felt well enough to drive hom.

I describe it as suffering some sort of trauma and it was accompanied by crushing fatigue.   Symptoms have improved but persist until today 03/29/2021: knee pain, weakness in the knees and fatigue.   Difficulty functioning normally: walking, ascending &amp; descending stairs and simply standing in place.   Symptoms worsen at night, knees become frozen and have to be adjusted with hands.

                                                On the 2nd day after receiving 1st dose of the vaccination, I developed a small case of hives that developed into blisters on my left foot near my toes.  This issue resolved within a week.    Approximately 2 1/2 weeks after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccination, I began to experience pain and stinging on my right arm and on my head/scalp on the right side.  This developed into a rash within 2 days of the pain, then began to blister behind my ear and on my scalp.  I also started to develop a rash on my back, similar to the issue on my scalp and behind my ear.  The pain and burning was progressing along with the increased presence of blisters,  I went to the Clinic on Friday, April 2, and referred to ER  - and was diagnosed with an outbreak of Shingles.  I was given Valacyclovir HCl to treat the outbreak.

I take cetirizine chronically due to allergies.   I have treated with ice packs which help with the discomfort. I have not sought medical attention since this seems to be a known side effect that has been reported to typically resolve in about a week.

Patient grew cooler and no longer felt dizzy, nauseated or itchy.  He said he had experienced similar reactions after his chemotherapy.  Afterwards patient chose to shop around the store.  He checked back in after an hour and said he felt better.  We once again observed and saw no signs of redness or rash.

                                                I had a stinging sensation after the Moderna shot, like a bee sting.  I woke up two weeks ago and my arm felt like someone punched it really hard, like a Charley horse.  My arm went numb, fingers are tingling, and at the site of injection it still feels like a Charley horse. I couldn?t sleep for three days and family started getting worried. My brother took me to Urgent Care this last Sunday. The doctor at Urgent Care told me it looked like a nerve issue, prescribed me Gabapentin and told me to do a follow up with my doctor. I saw my doctor on Wednesday and he suggested I report my symptoms because he is going through something similar. He prescribed me a stronger dose of Gabapentin and I?m waiting to see a neurologist. I have been missing a lot of work and I wish I never got the shot.

I had mild chills and fever, off and on, in the evening of the first dose, and I noticed chills on the next day, at times. Normal injection site pain, with only mild swelling, upper right arm. General, mild fatigue and feeling rather wiped out. Started a persistent very painful headache about an hour after the vaccination, front of forehead, which has not subsided as of 4/18/21. This is, to the best of my knowledge the only symptom remaining. OTC pain medication does very little to help with the pain.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the vaccine, while driving home, my chest area started to feel very warm, then I started to have difficulty breathing.  I was unable to swallow for the first minute or so, then my upper and lower lip got numb. After I was able to swallow   my saliva tasted metallic and a mental fog settled in.  I had difficulty concentrating for the next 2-3 minutes.  All symptoms lasted for  about 5 minutes.  About a week later I developed a skin rash reminiscent to a &#34;zoster.&#34;   It was the size of my palm on my left thigh. Although is almost clear now, the affected skin area lost some sensitivity. Another subcutaneous inflammation persist to present day.

                                                I experienced &#34;Moderna Arm&#34; on the day following the injection, but it subsided after a couple of days. Eight days later, though, it returned (swelling/redness/milder pain) -- accompanied by swelling in my right ankle and tightness/some tingling/mild pain in my right ankle/upper calf. I suffered a blood clot for the first time in each leg in early November; the more serious of the two was in the vicinity of my upper calf in my right leg. In December, I began to experience sensations in my right ankle that were similar (albeit more intense) to what I later experienced after my vaccine; the post-vaccination symptom in my right calf was also similar (but milder) to what I had experienced from the DVT.

                                                Moderate pain at injection site immediately after injection.  This spread to involve pain throughout the posterior upper arm for about 6 days before resolving. Did get moderate relief with use of ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q 8 hrs PRN. Received vaccine on 12/23/20 at 6pm.  Woke up at 5am to go to work on 12/24/20 and felt flu-like symptoms with subjective fever (did not measure), joint pain, and diffuse myalgias.  Symptoms progressed over the next three hours and culminated in about half an hour of significant rigors with uncontrolled shivering.  Ibuprofen dose of 600mg orally did help symptoms enough to allow me to finish my shift but I needed two more doses every 8 hours before symptoms resolved in 24 hrs.

                                                Very mild but noticeable numbness in tongue towards back of tongue (not front) on either side.  Seemed to dissipate after six hours.  Was not immediately noticeable and seemed to be more pronounced about 1/2 hour after injection.  I had the other expected soreness at injection site and general malaise approximately 24 hours after  - 96 hours after vaccine and I am only reporting this as I was not expecting the numbness in the tongue and was not sure if it was an adverse effect or just stress related.

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

I had no fever when I checked my temperature orally.  I developed 3 small urticaria with one on my abdomen and one on each thigh.    I treated with 50mg of benadryl and 800 mg of Motrin.  It appeared to be a euthermic cytokine storm to me ( I am an ICU physician).   The symptoms resolved without issue.

On Monday it was bigger and blotchy and my chest, although no rash, felt like I had a sunburn. At this point I filled out the CDC online form and submitted symptoms. I&#39;ve filled out daily health check each day, but didn&#39;t hear back from anyone. On Tuesday it was worse and I had a small rash/blotches on my left chest. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and benedryl.  It was the same, maybe el ghtly worse on Wednesday so I made an appointment with my primary care doctor. I saw my doctor today, Thursday, February 18th and was told I have shingles. The nurse practitioner said I was the 3rd person this week that came in with shingles. Should I still get the 2nd vaccine dose? I was given a prescription, which I haven&#39;t picked up yet, so I couldn&#39;t list what it is.

Day 2: Next morning was difficult getting out of bed. Skin was very sensitive to warm/hot shower water. Achy joints all over. Even my left injection site was sore even though I was injected on the right side. Fatigue at work. I was very wide eyed as described by co-worker. I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed. Day 3: When I awoke I felt like a fever had broke, Cooling sweat, but my temp was never over 98.5 degrees. My normal morning temp is usually 97.3 every day, but that one degree made a difference. I feel normal today and realize I was not well the day before.

I took a single Claritin and had relief within a few hours. The next day the itchiness returned and I took another single Claritin pill.  The hives went down and there was redness but the itchiness subsided.  I took a Claritin on the third day and had no other issues.  The rash and hives stayed localized only to the tops of my feet.  Important to note I did not use any different soap or detergent or have my feet exposed to any plants or vegetation.  I continued wearing cotton socks and slides as I had been doing all along.  I reported it to my doctor?s office who suggested I report it to the facility I received the shot from.  They referred me to report it here.

By the following morning, I felt that skin area, as well as the area around both of my eyes to feel as if I had sustained second degree burns. Additionally, the skin around my eyes particularly, presented with extreme dryness and geriatric symptoms, such as wrinkling and streched thinned skin, as if I were an elderly person (over 75 years old, and not 52).  The flaring/burning subsided after 4-5 days. However, the skin dryness around the eyes has persisted to this day (i.e. 5 weeks past the 1st vaccination). A day after the 2nd part of the vaccination, I felt moderate dizziness and headache, which lasted for about 24 hours. Also, light soreness and skin stiffening were experienced at the arm location where the shot was adminmistered.

                                                No reaction to first shot. Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

                                                Delayed side effect: developed red patch/rash at the site of injection on the left arm on 03/19/21 evening. The pinkish color patch was tender and a bit swollen with mild itch and also mild pain. This condition remained until 03/22/21. Today is 03/23/21 and this delayed side effect seem to be diminishing but not completely gone. I applied over the counter Cortizone cream last night to the rash area that may have helped diminish the reaction.

From minutes 3-6, increasing stomach discomfort and queasiness. From minutes 5-7,  profuse sweating of the entire head (everything from the neck up).

I had antibodies test completed on 12/22/2020 at hospital, my results were positive for antibodies with score of 205.  Dec 31, 2020:  Severe Chilling and shaking, teeth rattling shaking, unable to get warm,  Extreme fatigue, unable to stay awake, watch registered 4k steps despite me being in recliner for the day due to the shaking of body.   Jan 1, 2021:  Intense head ache, muscle aches and red and swelling welt at immunization site.  Recurrent fever, excessive sweating, soaked through tshirt, polo shirt twice, extreme fatigue. Same symptoms continue until Jan 5, 2021.  Symptoms were definitely more intense than just a casual body ache or fever. It felt like my body had covid again even though i know it is not possible to catch covid again from vaccine.

                                                I received my 1st COVID vaccine on 1/9/2021. On 1/17/2021 I woke with the injection site swollen and red and hard to the touch. Throughout the day, the swelling and redness reduced somewhat, but the area spread. The site was hot (99 degrees) compared to the surrounding area (96.5 degrees). The red area is now on much of my tricep.  It is not painful. If anything it is somewhat numb.

As of Wednesday , 1/20/21, three days after receiving the vaccine, I noticed small bumps on both ankles, palms of both hands, and left forearm.

                                                On 1/20/21 I received the vaccination. The next day I felt achy but not in distress.  On Saturday 1/23/21 I woke up with hives on my left arm and chest and a swelling on my left eye.  I took benadryl which had no effect. The next day the hives had progressed to blisters, my hand swelled  and my eye had almost swollen shut.  I contacted my health care advisers and they prescribed predinosne.  This reversed the reaction and the wounds are healing.  I have pictures of how I looked.

                                                I had a really bad day after the second dose. Horrible migraine headache that built as the day moved on.  As a rule, I do not get migraines and whenever I have gotten a headache I&#39;ve not had a  sensitivity to light or sound, like I did yesterday.  It was just miserable. Lots of body ache and a generalized feeling of sickness, similar to influenza or food poisoning.  I had no energy.   My arm at the injection site hurt constantly without even being touched all day and I could not sleep on my left side due to arm pain around the injection site. The arm pain from the injection site, occasionally radiated to my elbow joint , depending on how I moved my arm.  It is still sensitive today, two days later, and has a sensitive swelling in the area where the injection occurred. I do not feel bad today, but I do feel like I am 100% yet, either, but I feel a LOT better than I did yesterday.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  24 hours after receiving the vaccine I experienced extreme fatigue and dizziness for approximately 90 minutes.  I also encountered soreness at the injection site.  Not a problem.  Other than that, I felt fine.  Thank you.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

                                                On January 8, 2021, I felt bumps on the right side of my back.  They appeared to be shingles.  After discussing my symptoms with Dr. , he prescribed a course of valacyclovir.  I took this for 1 week.  The blisters, redness, and pain in my back/torso improved over time.  They lesions are now completely gone.

Left arm at injection site sore.  Details:  approximately 1 am I woke up with chills, headache, earache and tiredness.    I took Tylenol and this continued waking up again a few hours later the same.   Eventually I felt very hot.   Upon waking again tired/fatigue, headache, earache.   At approximately 11:30 am I got out of bed,  shaky &amp; very tired.   I eventually felt better, just tired.   (With exception of Arm still hurting).    Please note I had Covid in December and had similar symptoms, except these all hit me at the same time and felt much worse then when I had Covid.

The rash was pink, slightly inflamed, and was slightly feverish.  I had mild itching associated with the rash.  The rash lasted approximately 48 hours.  I would categorize the symptoms as mild.  The fact that they appeared 6 days after the vaccination was administered was interesting to me.

On Wednesday, 3/31/21, caregiver called me at the pharmacy.  She explained the rash and added patient had a scheduled appointment at 10am with the primary care physician.  I explained to show PCP and to stop by the pharmacy after the appointment so I could gather information to report and to view.  They stopped by the pharmacy approximately 11:30am.  I confirmed that they noticed the rash on 3/29/21 and verified by our vaccination records that he was immunized on 3/16/21.  I reviewed information again from constent form to verify no known allergies or prior adverse reactions to vaccines.  I also took a picture of the rash.  PCP had told patient not to get the second dose of Moderna. PCP told the caregiver to give Benadryl.   The rash was raised and splotchy red and ran from about 2in from top of deltoid down towards the inner arm/elbow for approx. 5 inches.  It didn&#39;t feel feverish.  I explained to monitor the rash by marking the edges to see if it spreads and to make note of the color.  That if it progressively gets worse to follow up with PCP.

It started to rise, and went up to 102.9.  I took some Tylenol and the fever went down back down to around 100, but then went up again after it wore off.  This continued until 12 pm on 18 April, when the fever finally broke.

                                                Whole-body skin rash: Rash started on day 4 post-vaccination. It began around elbow joints and spread to between fingers and wrists the first day. On the next day it spread to around shoulders/armpits, groin/buttocks, hands and scalp. On subsequent days it spread to arms, torso, face, knees, ankles, legs and feet in roughly that order. Rashes began to clear from each area roughly 48-72 hours after first appearing. Over-the-counter antihistamines helped reduce puffiness of rashes and manage itchiness. Loratadine was most effective followed by Cetirizine HCl and Diphenhydramine. Over the course of the reaction, rashes spread throughout 80-90% of the surface of my skin. It is currently day 9 post-vaccination and rashes have cleared from many areas, but still remain on about 10-15% of my body.

                                                I tested positive for covid on 1/08/21. I had the Moderna vaccine 1st dose 4/12/21 at 8:30am. No significant immediate reaction to the vaccine. Pain worsened at the injection point, but never significant, slight headache, tired, mild flu symptoms grew through the day. At 9:30PM I experienced Fever(101.6 at around midnight after fever had broke was probably higher between 9:30PM and 11:30pm). I experienced chills and violent shaking from approximately 9:30pm to 11:30pm, as bad or worse then the original covid from January. I was unable to sleep and finally took 2 Advil 200mg each at 3:00am. Advil helped and eventually fell asleep around 3:30am. Online information suggests that the 2nd dose generally has more severe reactions. I am concerned how much worse it will be and considering not getting the 2nd dose scheduled for May 10. Tuesday April 13 I experienced slight headache, body aches and exhaustion in the afternoon. Took Nyquil  severe cold and flu Tuesday evening and sleep well. Wednesday experienced lesser symptoms. Thursday had lower back and kidney area soreness. Friday april 15 back to normal.

                                                About 10 days after my second shot of Moderna, I experienced an outbreak of small (1-2mm), round, itchy hives across my body.  The hives were easily burst by scratching, releasing a clear fluid that scabbed over.  The itching was significant.  I treated it with calamine and OTC cortisone cream.  New hives appeared every day for approximately ten days, after which the hives began to recede and no new hives emerged.  After about 14 days the hives had mostly cleared up and the itchiness was mostly gone.  Note that I was on allergen desensitization treatment (drops under the tongue every day).  The day after the hives started I stopped the drops just in case that was the cause, but the hives did not get better, in fact they got worse the first few days.  I was very busy with work at the time, my allergist is an hour away, and my GP was scheduling months out, so I just thought I&#39;d ride it out without bothering the doctor.  The condition persisted for about 10-14 days, after which everything cleared up and I have not had another outbreak since.  re: talking to dr - I had some odd tissue irritation at the site of where my tonsils used to be with the first shot, so I figured the hives were just my immune system kicking it up a notch.  I never did talk to my doctor about it but I have had no recurrence of the symptoms so I haven&#39;t seen a need.

The next day (DEC 30th) I continued with a mild headache and the injection site pain had increased. By 1800 hrs on the 30th while at work I began not to feel well. Body aches all over along with headache. When I arrived home that night around 2300 hrs I was feeling flushed and the body aches had increased. I took my temperature several times that night with different thermometers to make sure I was getting accurate temp readings. My average temps consisted of 99.8. I did take iburofen that night. The following morning my temp was normal and the body aches had subsided. I continued to have a headache that day being DEC 31st. To note: I never had any prior symptoms, nor ever being covid positive to my knowledge. I had two prior surgeries, first procedure on NOV 4 and another procedure on DEC 9 of 2020. I was tested for Covid prior to both procedures which were negative results.

I was incredibly fatigued for about three days after. Also, the entire right forearm felt sore for about a week, as well. The day after vaccine shot, my right testes was achey and sore (and still is uncomfortable) Also, the top side of my right foot was very tender. During the course of the week, that part of my foot became lightly swollen as did the front of my right leg, up to the top of the shin bone. Today?s date: 1/22/21 5:19 pm and leg and foot still tender and slightly swollen.

Fatigue and muscle  ache for about 2 days post vaccination. Hot flashes since the vaccination and still happening. Had problem with them when I originally found out my thyroid was not properly regulated. Been on synthroid for over 3 years and only happened a few times a year since my thyroid levels have been regulated. Since vaccine they have been happening a few times a day and  also at night when sleeping. Checked my temp during episode and it is normal around 98.6 or below. Explanation of symptoms are  flushed, sweaty, HOT even when it is cold inside almost like there is an inner fire going on inside me

                                                I developed a rash consisting of many itchy red spots and patches on my front torso (upper chest to top of groin area) and some  similar but fewer spots on my back, arms, legs,  and neck.  My scalp is also itchy.  Rash began as one red spot  in the center of my chest near the breast bone and other spots began to appear.  I noticed the first spot on 1-11 or 1-12; I&#39;m not sure of the exact date.    I scheduled an appointment with my primary care provider for 1-22 at 11:00.  He examined  me and recommended I start a course of OTC antihistamines and topical  cream (Triamcinolone Acetonide .1%) for two weeks.  The rash is a bit less itchy since starting treatment two days ago, but it is still visible and present.  The itchiness woke me from my sleep last night and the night before.

                                                After the vaccination  on 1/18/2021 , I had just pain at the site of injection in my left arm for the next 2   to 3 days  and headache.  Took Advil and it went away. After 3 or 4 days i started feeling very mild pain inside my arm muscles between  the injection site and my elbow  which continued till 1/25/2021.   Later this  very mild internal pain shifted  to my elbow  and   feel a mild numbing sensation in my pinky finger.  It also feels little heavy when I move my arm.  This  continues till  today as I am reporting on 1/30/2021 3:30pm.  Since it has not bothered much , I did not seek medical care, hoping this will  go away in few weeks.

It hurt on the back right and above the right ear. It hurt to touch. My tongue is not functjioning now.  I had to get a MRI because they thought it could of been a mini stroke. MRI came back negative the doctors told me Bell Palsy.  They advise me not to get my second dose on 2/3/21.

                                                I received first Moderna vaccine shot (Lot # 011L20A) on Jan 6, 2021 and received second Moderna vaccine shot (031L20A) on Feb 3, 2021 at approx. 2:15pm Approximately 36 hours later, at 2am last night while sleeping, the left side of mouth (upper &amp; lower lips) swelled up for unknown reason(s).   I ate dinner at approx. 6pm, and had salad, steak and green beans, all of which I have eaten before without any side effects I don&#39;t believe it is a food allergy and I have not experience any trauma to my lips or face.  At approximately 5:30am, I took 2 Benadryl, in an attempt to reduce swelling.  As of 8am, the swelling is still evident.  Other than swollen lips, only other reaction to shot is minor soreness by the injection site in my left arm.  I am not sure if there is a correlation between the vaccine and my swollen lips, but I&#39;ve never had swollen lips before. Only other reason, for the swelling,  I could think of would by possible spider bite but I feel that is unlikely. If swelling persists, I will contact my doctor.

                                                I had pain in arm from injection immediately, after injection, which was much different than first dose.  But not unexpected.  But the adverse symptoms started about 5 hours in or so, i developed a cough, and dyspnea, it was tight in my chest, hard to breathe.  the cough was/is (it remains), sometimes hard and raspy, i was a bit wheezy, and I had air hunger, like i could not breathe or get air.  if i exhale to strongly i cough, if i talk to much i cough, if i sing i cough, if i inhale too deeply i cough.  I also have been very dizzy since the shot and vertigo.  I am still coughing and it is 5 days post shot.    I started developing headache and severe body pain, pain in  my spine, low back and joints.  which is expected, but i also had scalp pain and it hurt to be even touched the slightest bit on my scalp and everywhere on my body.  I had very stiff neck and eye socket pain as well.  I also feel &#34;funny&#34; in my head.  LIke dizzy, and vertigo, but also like it is wrapped in a heavy towel and my eyes feel heavy and like i can&#39;t see well.  my vision is as if it has diminshed.    5 hours after shot cough started, and the dyspnea, i started feeling chills and deep squeezing ache in my arm at jab site, and soon had fever of 100.6, over night it went to 100.8 and i felt terrible, headache, body ache, restless.  but next day fever was 102.  it remained all day, i had zero energy slept the whole day.  no appetite, did not eat anything except a scramble egg which made me nausea.  fever remained all day at 101.8. over night.  next day temp was 99.8 (my normal is 97.6) and it was 99.8 all day.  Cough was persistent and really bad with the dyspnea this whole time and i still have cough 5 days out, just giving a timeline here.  by friday, my temp was 98 but i felt extreemly fatigued.  I went and got a covid test which was negative.  i saw the chiropractor and they helped my back and headache a little bit.  went home and rested.  cough has lingered, dizzy lingers, chest tight and sob lingers.  fatigue lingers.   Cough and dyspnea are NOT signs, the sheet i got for V-safe says right on it these are NOT expected.

                                                At 5 days post vaccination, patient developed severe left shoulder pain, originally thought to be secondary to chronic shoulder pain and a recent fall, over the next three days it progressed to swelling, severe pain, and limited ROM. He ended up being admitted to the hospital and CT scan showed development of significant soft tissue infiltration around sternum and sternoclavicular joints. This was originally thought to be infectious, but he never developed a fever or leukocytosis and we feel this was most likely an inflammatory process. I have no idea if this was actually a vaccine side effect, but given the proximity in both time a location and the known complication of shoulder pain with the vaccine, it seems reasonable to give you the information to monitor for other similar cases.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.    Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 12-Feb-2021, approximately 2 days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    The patient received his vaccine on 12-Feb-2021 and reported that his arm hurt a little for a few days. On 14-Feb2021, he reported that he started feeling sluggish and on 20-Feb-2021 he began to have difficulty breathing and pain in the right lower base of rib cage. He went to urgent care where he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism for which he received treatment. On the evening of the same day, he again started having difficulty breathing with pain upon inhalation. He returned to urgent care and was subsequently admitted at 12:30 AM on 21-Feb-2021. That  Monday, 22-Feb-2021, a doppler ultrasound revealed a deep vein thrombosis in the left calf. Patient was treated with heparin intravenously (IV). He was discharged 22-Feb-2021.    Treatment for the event included Xarelto 20mg twice per day for two weeks and Heparin IV.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and dyspnea, was considered recovering/resolving as of discharge on 22-Feb-2021.  The outcome of the events, vaccination site pain and sluggishness, were considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Beginning about 16hours after the shot (the next morning) my stomach began to bother me a little, within half an hour or so I began to feel a little tingle from the top left arm (shot area) down to my stomach including my sternum area.  It got progressively worse. By about hour 17 I was beginning to get cold sweats and stomach bothering me more. By hour 18 I was cold, sweating, nauseous, vomiting, hard tight pain in stomach /and sternum/chest.  Stomach / chest pain persisted badly for about 30- 45 minutes then began to subside.  By hour 19 most of the sever pain subsided.  for the rest of the day (@and still 25 hours later) I still have a lingering miserable stomach and slight headache.  I slept most of the afternoon without any medication.

                                                First symptoms to appear were noticeably sore right arm and fatigue about six hours after injection.  About eleven hours after shot I had headache, feeling of irregular body temperature, nausea, body aches..  I took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea which helped.    About 24 hours after the injection I experienced sore armpit/lymph nodes of shot arm.   All but the symptoms except the sore armpit/lymph nodes  were mostly gone within 30 hours of the shot.  The lymph nodes felt better a day or two later.

                                                Approx. 4 days after receiving the 1st dose of Moderna Vaccine, developed a rash at the injection site (left shoulder), inner area of right bicep, inner area of both left and right thighs, around the groin area. The affected areas itched intensely. This rash lasted approximately 15 days. Used otc Zyrtec and otc cortisone cream to help control rash and itching.   After about day 12, notified my primary care physician for advice. Instructed to use otc. Pepsid 20mg 2x daily and continue otc Zyrtec.

This is the sickest I&#39;ve felt in decades, maybe my entire life.  Oh, and my injection site hurt too.  The night of the shot, and the day after, were the worst.  I&#39;m writing this on the morning of day 2.  Today, the fever, body aches, and joint pain are gone.  I still have a headache (but it&#39;s better than yesterday), fatigue, and injection site pain.  After my first Moderna shot, I had a slight headache and fatigue the following day, but this second shot really kicked my ass.

                                                Muscle tightness - soreness - at the arm with the injection and it was for about three and five days. Maybe about 2 weeks from vaccine -  I had some congestion (nasal congestion and sneezing) - it was odd (not allergies) and it lasted a solid with heavy heavy drainage and that lasted about two days. I had to use the Mucinex D for it. Then I had the nose bleed - it wouldn&#39;t stop bleeding in right nostril. I went to ER - Sunday, the 28th - started at 10:30 pm and after midnight on the 29th it was after 4 hours of bleeding when  I went to ED in town. The doctor said my nasal passages were really dry because of the weather. I was using a travel CPAP that doesn&#39;t have a humidifier.  They cleared a giant clot in the back of my throat - it was the size of a hamburger - it was huge. They used a nasal vasodilator - it looked like nasal spray and they did it and stopped. Vitals were stable and they sent me home. I might have one bloody nose after  - a week after and they had given me the nasal vasodilator and that stopped it. They also prescribed a nasal saline spray and I only use the CPAP with the humidifier now.

Sore right arm.   4/24/21 In the morning headache and body ache.  Late afternoon severe body ache, chills, 101 degree fever.  800mgs of ibuprofen and 1000mgs of Tylenol every 6-8 hours did not bring the fever down.  Sore right arm.   4/25/21 Headache and body ache all day. Late afternoon headache continued but with severe body ache, chills, 100 degree fever, swollen lymph nodes in right arm pit,  red, hot and swollen rash between right shoulder and neck,  sore arm.  We called the emergency department  and they stated it could take up to 3 weeks before the painful swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit would dissipate.  They left it up to us whether to come in. We chose not to because we didn&#39;t feel there was anything more they could do for us.

                                                A very strong pain around the shot spot on my arm. It was a lot more than the first shot. I could not sleep comfortably at night because of it. Interestingly, that was the only adverse effect I had and I was expecting more because everybody on line said the second shot side effects were to be more serious than the first one. I am glad sore arm was the only thing I experienced. I took Ibuprofen for it and it helped a little but did not do away with the pain completely. When I woke up the second day after the shot, the pain was almost completely gone.

By lunchtime, I am experiencing extreme fatigue, overall body soreness, loss of appetite, and increased pain at the injection site. By 3 pm I am home and in bed, dealing with chills/sweats as well. Couldn&#39;t find any comfort to sleep thru the night. In the morning of the 29th, I&#39;m still displaying all the issues listed above. I stay home from work and go back to bed. I awake at noon to find all the listed issues greatly reduced, but feel soreness in my jaw and feel swelling in the lymph nodes under the jawbone, more so on the right than the left.

                                                Had pain in my shoulder (and  neck on my left side) as soon as the shot went in. At roughly three hours after the shot, I felt I was slurring my speech (I had to make a very concerted effort to make proper sentences and not slur) and was very dizzy. I also was having a hard time with lights. For example, I was unable to look in the mirror in my bathroom as the lights above the mirror were too bright for me. At three hours after the shot, I had severe pain in my left shoulder. Overall, I felt as I had been sedated or drugged. I tried walking to the nearest convenience store to get some food and I felt I was experiencing vertigo. Several days after the vaccine I had a slight cough and sore throat. I am still experiencing a slight cough on some day sand a slight sore throat.   I had a subtle red patch in the left shoulder area a couple days after the shot. Eight or nine days after the shot, I had covid arm and had a very visible red patch on my left shoulder. I have pictures of this.  I have been feeling very tired and dizzy ever since the first shot. My glands in my neck under my jaw line are also swollen. I do not know if it is either  wise or safe for me to get the second shot, which is scheduled for this Friday as it seems that I still have not recovered from the first shot. Can my immune system really take another round of this?  There are a couple other things that I have noticed. I don&#39;t seem to be thinking very clearly and I have noticed a remarkable number of type-os and poor syntax in emails that I send at work; this is not normal for me.   Finally, after the shot, I noticed that my muscles, when doing a little exertion such as pushups, would build lactic acid quicker and more blood seemed to be delivered to my working muscles. I still have not regained my strength and tire more easierly when playing tennis or hitting against the tennis wall, for example. This is also not normal and not how I felt before the first injection.

                                                Note: May 24, 2021 the pharmacy that administered the COVID vaccines contacted me with some billing questions. When I mentioned my severe reactions, they told me they were filing a report upon my behalf. When done they told me it was the VAERS system and gave me a reference number (Ref-531994). I decided that not enough information would be in that report so wanted to submit myself because of my severe reaction and hospitalization. My PCP was not involved until after hospital for a follow up and I was seen by numerous doctors there, so I have no easy single POC until I dig more.

Apr 17, 2021 Wake to find tongue hugely swelled. Thought I&#39;d bitten in my sleep. Unable to eat, hard to swallow fluid past tongue. Lasts for a bit over 36 hrs. Apr 19, 2021 Knee pain begins spreading up thighs down calves. Pain also beginning in feet toes and ankles. Apr 20, 2021 Knee pain when bending prevents me from entering truck to drive.

Apr 28, 2021 Approx. 2:30 pm knee/overall leg pain begins increasing rapidly to higher than before level. Over next three days increases to point where I cannot stand/walk due to pain. Unable to sleep due to pain also. Apr 28, 2021 Same Day-Around 4:30 pm notice voice is becoming raspy. By 6 pm my voice is completely gone. I have no voice for next approx. 36 hrs.

Less each day but still need for stability. Still have knee pain. Have higher level of pain in feet.  I had/have a major reaction to the Moderna vaccine. This should be investigated and reported on. Thank you.

The next day it stopped and he had no other symptoms other than a sore arm where the shot was given.  The second vaccine did not cause these same symptoms and he felt fine after the second.

                                                Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in right lower leg.  Symptoms initially occurred about two days after feeling sick with a high fever.  Initially, the pain in the right calf muscle was thought to be a muscle or tendon strain.  On May 22nd, during a campout, there was pain along the entire right leg, but at the time I thought it was just related to lower back pain from sleeping on the ground.  On May 27 and 28th there was sharp pain at the bottom of my right foot, then on May 29th I noticed sweeling and a hard warm spot just above the inside right ankle.  I reported to a local urgent care clinic first  then was referred to Medical ER.

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)

                                                Patient received 0.5mL Moderna Covid19 vaccine at mass vaccine clinic on 12/30. This patient was a walk thru and not a patient of HP at this time.    Daughter reported to ARNP,RN Director Clinical Support on 01/03 the following outcomes:    Patient first exhibited the first signs of reaction started about 60 hours after vaccine: hives only (no difficulty breathing, dizziness, lightheadedness); applied hydrocortisone cream, took diphenhydramine. Patient slept for a few hours then woke up for lunch. Around 12:30-1:00 the patient exhibited three episodes of syncope. Emergency services was called after the first. Firefighters couldn&#39;t find BP, was in 70s by doppler only. Patient taken to hospital for care.    Discharged from ED around 5, suspecting hypotension 2/2 to diphenhydramine use. Monitored vitals at home; became severely hypotensive (BP 70s/40s both with automatic monitor and manual read) and lethargic again about an hour or so after, but normotensive again right before about to call ambulance. Pt claimed to be okay and had some dinner. Fourth episode of syncope, ambulance was called.         Patient remains at hospital ED since, still in observation unit. BP&#39;s normalized but itching returns periodically. IV steroids and diphenhydramine. Took head CT yesterday; no word on the results. Stable and alert enough since yesterday to communicate with us with his phone. Patient is scheduled for an echo to be done today.    No hx of severe allergic reaction. Treated for active TB 30 years ago, shingles x2 in the past few years; otherwise healthy 55 y/o male.     Pt discharged 01/04 to home with fatigue and malaise. Not additional symptoms reported since then. Provider doing full cardiac and neurologic work up.

The COVID arm side effect seems to be resolving.

I took a benedryl at 5:00pm on Wednesday 3/03/2021. Called my family doctor on Thursday morning and he told me to take 1 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 at night to help clear the rash. My Doctor said it was not anaphylaxis as it did not happen immediately after the vaccine but 24 hours later. I have no trouble breathing as I check myself with oximeter and my oxygen level is 97%.  I did have Covid on January 3, 2021 and after the vaccine on 03/02/2021 I experienced nausea, chills and a dull headache and then the rash. I have experienced this type of rash before after a stomach virus and it lasts for 3 or 4 days and clears up.

                                                About 30 seconds after receiving my injection I started to feel dizzy, nauseous, blurry vision and a few minutes later my lips and fingertips became tingly and numb.  My cousin let an attendant know and they sent a Paramedic over to our vehicle.  The Paramedic took my vitals (which I believe were all normal) and gave me a bag in case I needed to vomit.  I started to feel a little better about 20 minutes after the injection and chose to go home and rest rather than go to the hospital.  The 2nd day my arm hurt where to injection was given, I had a headache and was still a bit nauseous although I never did vomit.  I still did not feel 100% on the 3rd and 4th day and better on the 5th day.

They were warm to the touch on the outside but I felt like they were very cold.  I put on wool socks, added a blanket and took 2 Advil and after a while the cold feeling diminished (but didn&#39;t go away).  Eventually the following morning I didn&#39;t have the cold feeling anymore.  I also had the typical post vaccine low grade fever and fatigue.  All of these symptoms were gone within 36 hours of getting the vaccine.  I have talked to others who had the same &#34;cold toes&#34; symptom as me, one of them still has it sometimes.

                                                Approximately 9 days after the vaccination, tender left axillary lymphadenopathy, malaise, chills, and high fever (to 104F) developed; followed several days later by development of marked erythema and warmth over the left chest wall, left axillary region, and onto left back. This presentation required brief hospitalization for treatment of a presumed cellulitis and further diagnostic workup of fevers and lymphadenopathy.  The patient was treated with antibiotics for cellulitis and empirically for possible tick-borne illness (early Lyme, glandular tularemia) with notable improvement in the skin erythema and fevers.

Admitted to hospital, was on prednisone and benzos, for a few days. Was in contact with neuro and endocrinologist.  I was very angry with this happened I tried calling Mederna, Mederna read him the info about not being able to sue them. He waited three months before Mederna asked for records, CDC did nothing. Very angry about the fact that nothing was set up to help people with severe reactions to the vaccines. No one wanted to listen to him. Endocrinologist said this is not normal and they continued to push forward and it was proven that it was attributed to the vaccine.  Nerve damage underneath the right eye from the Bells Palsy.

                                                Approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine shot, I experienced sudden dizziness and nausea for approximately 1 minute. Also, my entire left arm looked a bit red, but no hives. It went away as quickly as it occurred. Approximately 30 minutes after that, I experienced nausea again( which was a bit more intense). It also lasted for approximately 1 minute then it quickly ceased. At 4pm (5 hours after the shot), I got a severe headache. I&#39;m not sure if that was related to the vaccine. I took acetaminophen and slept soundly through the night. The next day, I felt fine, and I have felt fine since.

                                                Received 2nd vaccination 22 days apart; Sore left deltoid; Swelling of the lymph nodes on the same side; Tender axilla; Very very slight tender to touch in the pectoral area; A spontaneous report was received from a 56-year-old male physician who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla, tender to touch in the pectoral area and second dose vaccine administered 22 days apart.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included metoprolol, fish oil, vitamin B, vitamin D3, zinc, vitamin C, turmeric, sertraline, and encapsulated dried fruits and vegetables.   On 28 Dec 2020 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 19 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient experienced sore left deltoid, swelling of the lymph nodes on the same side, and tender axilla. On 19 Jan 2021, the patient experienced very slight tender to touch in the pectoral area and second dose of vaccine given 22 days after first dose. No treatment information was provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome of the events, experienced sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, and tender axilla was considered resolved on 30 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, slight tender to touch in the pectoral area and second dose vaccine given 22 days apart, was considered resolved on 19 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of a 56-year-old male patient who experienced second dose vaccine administered 22 days apart (Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered) and non-serious events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla, tender to touch in the pectoral area after the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot # 012L20A., expiration date-unknown).  The events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla occurred the same day after administration of the first dose of the vaccine and event of tender to touch in the pectoral area occurred on the same day after the last dose and 22 days after the first dose.  No treatment was reported, and outcome is resolved for the event of slight tender to touch in the pectoral area. The reported events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla, tender to touch in the pectoral area are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine. Hence, based on the information provided a causal association between the administration of mRNA-1273 and the reported events cannot be excluded The event of second dose vaccine administered 22 days apart is considered not applicable.

                                                Overnight developed chills, sweating, mild hallucinations (or very weird dreams), jnsomnia, temp hung around 101.2. Next morning quite achy, strong headache, light sensitive. No breathing or cognition issues. Not eating but no g.i. issues. Injection site is sore.  Mostly recovered or anyway not worried about lingering symptoms at 20 hours past shot (if something gets worse I&#39;ll report again). My goal in submitting this report was only to describe  what I consider to be note-worthy side effects. By comparison, I had a first covid  vaccine dose exactly 1 month ago and no real signs. Also, I had covid-19 infection, moderately sick, in March 2020 (tested pos for covid antibodies in May 2020.

Tired and joint pain, itching began to get worse in the next 3 days and moved to my back, legs and soles of my feet. The second week I went to my dermatologist for exam and began taking Zyrtec for allergies which alleviated the symptoms after 5 days.

                                                About 9 days after first dose I started to notice hives and redness on both side of my stomach, on both front lower legs and arms. Went to primary care Dr and he said he didn?t know we?re it came from but to take allergy med. which I have been doing and it started to clear up some but then I got my second dose and it really came on after that. It is not really a itch rash but taking a shower seems to make it worse and itchy. It has not gotten any better and seems to burn a little bit at times. I plan on giving it another week are so and if not better will be going to dermatologist. As far as I can remember I have never had a rash besides poison oak. I do not nor can I find any information online about a rash starting several days after vaccine unlike the allergic reaction some people are having soon after receiving vaccine. So it does have me a little worried mainly because I do not know what it is but I?m pretty sure it is from the vaccine considering the fact it started 9 days after first dose and never really went away and the second dose seems to have aggravated it to we?re it is worse.

The arm is swollen, warm to the touch, and black and blue. Today I have a mild fever, some hot flashes, nausea without vomiting, body weakness, and overall muscle aching. This is the sickest I&#39;ve been in years.

                                                About a day later I noticed some itching in the back of neck and over the course of a few more days, it got worse and I started to see red welts developing on my neck, left shoulder, and left upper side of chest and back.  It was very itchy and starting to get more painful.  Then 10 days later some of the welts turned to scabs while new welts were developing.  Much more pain.  Also, I left shoulder started to increase with pain and was loosing range of motion.    About 5 days into the first shot, I spoke to my primary doctor and originally he said just a reaction to vaccine, use Alegra and that should  take care of it.  I contacted him 10 days into the vaccine and sent him pictures of the welts and he said it&#39;s very clear I have the shingles.  While he didn&#39;t say the shingles were related to the vaccine, the timing is very suspicious.  I truly believe something happened with the vaccine that caused this.

Still applying Benadryl 2x per day.

Since his COVID vaccine had been 03/02/2021 he was able to have the second dose of Shingrix.  After giving him the Shingles vaccine, he asked why he still had a hard lump where he received his second Moderna vaccine.  I asked the patient where he had the vaccine.  He showed me he had his vaccine on the back of his right arm (SubQ).  The spot was palpated and was hard to the touch.

I developed a high grade fever of 102° @ 2am minor body aches and pains, no sweating. I self administered 500 mgs. of Acetaminophen every 4 hours as needed for a total of 4 doses. The high grade fever broke 6 hours later into a low grade fever ranging from 99.7° to 100.3° minor body aches. Minor pain and discomfort at the inoculation site and arm joint. The low grade fever broke and I returned to normal temperature Monday morning at 11am.

He was taken to a room to lie down and he reports blood pressure was elevated at 152/110. He was given Benadryl and after approximately 45 minutes his blood pressure went back to normal and patient was feeling well enough to go home. Over the course of 24 hours after the vaccine he felt very achey and at one point had a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, which lasted about 4-6 hours. Patient said he took Tylenol to help with these adverse effects but it did not help very much.  Around the injection site he had a bump the size of a ping pong ball and it was red and warm, but the bump completely went away by the fourth day after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Pain at injection site developed throughout the day.  Then achiness over entire body began.  During the night, chills and slight fever (99 degrees) developed with increased achiness.  The next day, fever subsided some with Tylenol, but fatigue, achiness, and light headedness continued.

                                                Was hospitalized on  April 14th with severe pain radiating from the back to the front and groin.  No diagnosis was made. Was released on April 15 with Lidocaine Patch,  Flexeril and APAP#3. Pain persisted and I went to the local doctor. There were no visible sores yet but she agreed with the diagnosis of Shingles. She prescribed Percocet, Gabapentin and Valtrex. The pain and burning are still present and unbearable at times. No sores yet. (4/17)

From my research, this did not seem like a typical side effect.    I had trouble sleeping, eating and swallowing without pain.  This is now 8 days after my shot and I still have pain.  I have taken motrin and this has helped, but only some.  As of today, my pain is not as bad as it had developed over the past week.  I reported this to my healthcare provider via a call first and all their only recommendation was to take motrin and not come in for a visit / investigation for 2 weeks which I did not agree with at all based on the severity.  These symptoms that I am reporting do not seem common and based on the severity I really question if i plan to take the second dose.  I really felt that this needed to be reported

                                                Developed a marked rash with mottled skin pigment to left shoulder and pit of my left elbow joint, warm to touch and severe itching. The shoulder rash disappered after a few days, However, I still have the left elbow {pit of elbow joint} rash that disappers and reappears regularly. It is localized to this area and about silver dollar size, Hydrocortisone creams  do help manage the reoccuring rash, but it keeps returning and hasn&#39;t spread anywhere else. Humid environments really cause it to intensify. I have head aboutCOVID arm  and looked at online photo&#39;s, and the pictures of these reported COVID arm rashes looks exactly like mine. However, COVID arm is only suppose to last no more than a week or two after vaccinations - according to some websites. I have not had any medical testing as of yet, However I do wish to document this occurance should it become a problematic issue for myself or others.

                                                This case was reported by a consumer via call center representative and described the occurrence of vaccination failure in a 58-year-old male patient who received Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis.   Co-suspect products included Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis, COVID-19 MRNA-1273 VACCINE (COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA) (batch number 040B21A, expiry date unknown) for prophylaxis and COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA (batch number 002B21A, expiry date unknown) for prophylaxis.   Concurrent medical conditions included ulcerative colitis. Concomitant products included azathioprine.   On 11th June 2019, the patient received the 2nd dose of Shingrix. On 9th April 2019, the patient received the 1st dose of Shingrix. On 9th April 2021, the patient received the 2nd dose of COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. On 11th March 2021, the patient received the 1st dose of COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. In May 2021, between 1 and 2 years after receiving Shingrix and more than 2 years after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced shingles, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg. On an unknown date, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria GSK medically significant), feeling unwell and decreased immune responsiveness. The patient was treated with valaciclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg were unknown and the outcome of the shingles was not recovered/not resolved and the outcome of the generalized raised red spots limbs and red spotty rash were recovering/resolving.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to Shingrix and Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: The patient self reported the case. On an unknown date, less than 3 months after the 1st dose and less than 2 months after the 2nd dose the patient experienced shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg. The patient had not felt good for a few weeks and then in the last week before the reporting date he started to get symptoms.  The patient felt crappy and had shooting pain in his back on the left side and the pain shot down his leg and then he had a rash on his left leg later. His torso, back, butt, and upper thighs were stingy, burning, and he was sensitive to the touch on his skin before the rash appeared. He described it as aches and pains and a stingy, needle feeling.  The patient had a history of ulcerative colitis and he took Azathioprine during the past few years so he was unsure if his rash was related to his weak immune system or the COVID vaccine.  The patient had sent pictures of his left leg rash to his physician and they recommended him to see a dermatologist who diagnosed him with shingles after a biopsy and tests. They immediately put him on Valtrex and he claimed that things started to calm down and the rash was started to dry up.  The patient described the rash as starting off as red spots that were raised up that looked like a target with a red circle around it that would get bigger. The raised spot looked like there was fluid inside. The dot in the middle looked dark in color and the red part that had spread looked like a bruise that was resolving with the color of yellow and brown.  The patient had a few clusters of the rash on the inside and outside of his left leg and back on his calf.  It was unknown if the reporter considered the shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA and COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. The reporter consented to follow up.

Guardian pharmacist noted the change in facial color and alerted RN who was monitoring s/p vaccination of her observations.  He was red with facial edema upon my arrival.  Benadryl 25mg PO while he was still able to swallow by RN.   EMS called while he took the Benadryl.  After Benadryl, checked vitals ? VERY hypertensive and increasing diaphoresis; Started to wax and wane with consciousness.  Administered epi pen by RN in attendance once change in level of consciousness was noted.  After epi, became pale, increasing diaphoresis with change in level of consciousness.  BP was lower, still hypertensive.  Placed on floor by staff.  While on the floor, consciousness improved.  EMS arrived and assumed care.

                                                12 hours after began to have a scratch throat.  at 13 hours post dose, had a headache start and an unusual erythematous spot on the posterior palate above Uvula with almost a white scratch appearance inside the erythema.  16 hours post dose began to have fevers and chills.  At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

Fever (did not check it) lasted about 24 hours, broke the next night and slept fine. But two days later, I have a 99.9 temp, a minor cough (not persistent, and not bad, but occasional) and runny nose (it is also chilly outside). I am wondering if I have covid now or not, very concerned but it could simply be the reaction to the vaccine as well. I will call my Dr tomorrow and see what they say, and if the fever is gone again in the am.

After discussing with patient and patients spouse, agree that patient needs to be seen by either PCP, Dr. or go to ER. At the time pt did not wish to go to ER. Wife proceeded to call Dr.&#39;s office to see about getting him in. Pt then started to feel worse and like he needed to go to ER. offered to call for an ambulance, pt refused as his wife could take him and would probably be quicker. staff offered diphenhydramine and pt declined, stating he would wait until he got to ER for treatment. Pt appeared very anxious and nervous. transported him via wheelchair to his vehicle at 1620, his wife then drove him to ER. 04/09/2021 at 0828  I left a voicemail with pt for follow up.  0830 I called to get follow up on pt. I spoke with the nurse that treated the patient. Pt did indeed come to ER and was treated for a reaction. He was given a dose of benadryl and solumedrol. Pt verbalized feeling like he was having a severe anxiety attack and that his adrenaline was really high. Nurse stated that she agreed with him. Pt was later discharged that evening. No epinephrine use reported.

                                                6 days after receiving the shot I had significant pain in my left side around around mid-rib and at the top of my left shoulder.  the significant pain last for at least 72 hours.  I took  Tylenol, which helped, but never completely relieved the pain. The pain moved at times to other areas, including my neck and back and right side of my chest.  I also had shortness of breath, which continues to this day. 9 days after the shot I noticed  redness at the site of the shot.

Warm skin persisted. After about two weeks, patch fully disappeared, skin returned to normal temp, and itching largely subsided.

                                                On Monday night I tossed and turned, and I gradually realized I felt quite ill. By Tuesday morning I had what I understand to be typical reactions to the second dose: soreness at the injection site, fatigue, muscle aches, chills, overheating, loss of taste, and a touch of nausea. My head was swimming, and putting my hands to my forehead made my head feel a bit better. By midday Wednesday I was gradually improving. But Wednesday evening, at my desk, I noticed my vision seemed blurry. On Thursday morning, I verified that my reading vision (with glasses) was (and is) markedly worse. Now I cannot easily read from my smart phone or computer screen. I plan to see an optometrist as soon as possible.

By the time  I had arrived at the house my head was pounding.   I was feeling  a dizzying  migraine.  I have not had one of those in a  while.  It was also accompanied with lite nausea.  I had a cup of coffee when I came home and went to bed.  I was feeling so bad I had to get up  and take a Sumatriptan and another cup of coffee.  I laid back down for a few more hours.  I awakened later,  used the restroom  and was feeling much better than before.   Although my arm and shoulder is sore at the injection site,  I?m feeling much better.

                                                After receiving 2nd Vaccine, next morning I had very swollen and a painful knot at injection site, flu like symptoms as provider told me might occur, then on March 1, 2020, I starting having severe symptoms in which I was unable to go to work.  I had A SEVERE migraine level 10 pain, severe joint pain all over body level 10 pain, dizziness, eyes burning, blurred vision, chills, extremely fatigued.  Called PCP for doctor appointment. Went for doctor visit and told him all my symptoms, He was very concerned I had a reaction to vaccine.   He prescribed prednisone 7 day pack for severe joint pain &amp; inflammation, Nurtec disintegrating tablets, meloxicam, ordered bloodwork and had follow up in 2 weeks, after two weeks symptoms were still the same very severe, he referred me to Neurologist for evaluation, she ordered MRI as a stat to be done right away,  and started me on meds for Severe Migraines and sent me to Ophthalmologist, she had a nurse get me an appointment the next day.   I saw Ophthalmologist the very next day he did workup and diagnostic testing in his office and stated I had severe swelling and inflammation in the optic nerves in both eyes, and referred me and sent records to Dr., Neuro Ophthalmologist and contacted their office to get me in right away.  I had my appointment with Dr. and she has ordered an ultrasound of my eyes by retina specialist which appointment is in June.  I have follow up with her after ultrasound is done.  Due to severe joint pain I am still having my PCP has referred me to a rheumatologist.  My pain is severe.  The vaccine has attacked my immune system.  Doctors and specialists are doing everything possible and I am still off work.  My return to work date has not been determined.

                                                Patient admitted with high grade AV block, sinus pause, and recurrent syncope. 57-year-old white male with PMH only of cigarette use who notes about 2 weeks of generalized malaise, then in the last 24 hours has had 2 syncopal episodes that were accompanied by diaphoresis only without other prodrome.  He got his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 5/28/21, then on the following day had been working in the barn without any dyspnea chest pain or shortness of breath but felt generally fatigued so went to take a nap.  He got up to check his temperature, then &#34;just hit the floor&#34;.  Not preceded by blackout of vision, lightheadedness, chest pain, dyspnea palpitations, nausea but was accompanied by sweats.  He believes he was out only briefly, and when he awoke was not confused and did not have tongue biting or loss of bladder or bowel continence.  He then got up and went about his day normally, then around 2 AM awoke to let the dogs out and had an identical event, but this time hit his chin on a chain saw on the floor and suffered a laceration. He presented to ED for evaluation where his laceration was sutured. He is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Initial labs and diagnostics are unrevealing and an EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm without acute or chronic ischemic changes.  Noncontrast CT of the head and the face showed no evidence of bony damage, no intracranial bleed or large territory infarct. While in the ED, the patient had a brief bradycardic episode accompanied by diaphoresis although a dedicated strip is not available and it is unclear what his rhythm was.  He did not syncopize.  Hospitalist service was asked to accept for syncope evaluation. When admitting physician saw patient, he reported feeling completely well without any other issues.  He does note he had about 2 weeks of malaise before all of this started and a mild decrease in his ability to work intensely, but had attributed this to cigarette smoking.  Review of systems was essentially negative.  He is a hobby farmer and has had a couple of tick bites this year. While admitting physician was in the room at the end of the visit, the patient had an episode of diaphoresis and went into a high-grade second-degree AV block with disappearance of atrial activity without ventricular escape and lost consciousness for about a second.  No jerking or twitching observed.  The episode a couple of seconds then self terminated and the patient awoke and completely recovered mentation and was in a sinus rhythm.  He was diaphoretic and felt ill afterward this.  He had no chest pain or dyspnea. Immediately after the episode with repeat vitals the patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 70s and a normal sinus rhythm and blood pressure is 136/80.  Oxygen saturations are preserved. Not on any rate limiting agents either here in emergency department or at home. Patient found to have P-P interval prolongation with AV block and subsequent sinus arrest possibly situational in the setting of coming off of a colonoscopy and receiving second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. A pacemaker was placed 6/1/2021 without complication and the patient was discharged in stable condition on 6/2/2021.

                                                4 days after receiving my vaccine I experienced a painful sore throat.    Examination of my oropharynx reveals a solitary 1mm pustule  with surrounding erythema on the posteriolateral edge of the hard palate.  I have not experienced any fever or URI symptoms.  It is on the same side as my vaccine.  I am not sure if it is relevant but I reached out to my Infectious Disease colleague and he recommended I report this to you ( I am a Dermatologist). The lesion is still present today 36 hours later without any new lesions or progression.  I do not have any history of herpes or aphthous ulcers and have never had a lesion on this part of my hard palate before.

I wonder if people who have had the virus should be being told to get the vaccine since I suspect intense reaction is due to pre existing immunity.

My heart began racing to about one and one half the normal to a rate of 100, at about 30 hours after the injection.  It then slowed to 50 bpm for about 15 minutes before racing back to 100 and becoming somewhat irregular, slow pace followed by several quick beats then a beat or two slow again and then several quick beats.  This lasted for a few hours and then I fell asleep.  When I woke up about 7 hours later, it was back to normal.  Some slight body ache and headache.

The next day, he began to have what appeared to be petechial hemorrhaging in his abdomen. By Sunday, the hemorrhaging had spread from his neck to his knees.  On Monday, he saw his primary care physician, who sent him to hospital ER. After performing extensive tests, the ER doctor stated that the test results were normal, and he could find no reason for most of his body being purple. By Tuesday, he was returning to normal.  The abdominal pain was gone by Tuesday as well.

He did say that he had not ate breakfast before receiving his vaccine. He also spoke with a family member who is a doctor but did not actually go to a doctor&#39;s office/clinic.

It looks like bee stings bigger then a quarter 3 on my stomach and 3 on back. Lots of little bumps. It hurts very sensitive. I felt like my ribs and kidney were hurting but it is because of the nerves when I touch them.  This is been about a week. I am going to call my doctor. The pain is not just one spot but the whole area around them.

It might be 20A at the end and not 2OA with the letter O.  As for the adverse event, after 24 hours had a bit a sore arm, some redness and hardness in the area of the injection.  Seemed to go away in a day or so for the most part then I forgot about it until last night, 2-22-21 (eight days after injection) when I noticed rather large oval-shaped red mark about the size of an egg.  Slightly elevated but not bad.  No pain.  A little itchy but not bad.  So I googled it quickly today and I find out that it&#39;s not all that uncommon and likely more common than you realize because most guys aren&#39;t going to take the time to report something like this, in my opinion.   I see that some of the health care workers are being quoted as saying it&#39;s probably either an allergic reaction to a vaccine ingredient or an immune system reaction.  In my opinion it&#39;s the latter, at least with respect to me as several years ago after being bitten by a honeybee in palm of hand in fat part near thumb a similar thing happened.where it hurt and was red for a day or two or three and then seemed to recede but then came back with a red mark bigger than before, but it didn&#39;t hurt much, more of an itch if I recall correctly.  So for some reason that&#39;s apparently how my immune system fights off something foreign.  I have type A blood I believe, if that matters.  I think I have a pretty good strong immune system for my age, as well.  Hopefully the second shot will not produce that much more of a reaction because of this or how I&#39;m reacting now to the first shot.  No big deal just a lot of unknowns.  I&#39;ll follow the news on this in the next couple weeks and report back if anything develops further.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Woke up at 11:15 pm with severe shivering, and was extremely cold. My temperature was 98.6. Turned my heat up to 74, added blankets to my bed, could not get warm. Finally had to add a large heat pack to my bed to alleviate shivering. My left shoulder and arm hurt. Abnormally bad sleep. Woke up this morning at 9:30am and am lethargic and very tired. I feel like I was hit by a truck.

                                                Got COVID Arm about eight or nine days after first dose.  See previous submission on 2-23-21 with the Temporary VAERS #318903.  First dose was on Feb. 14th and second dose was on March 14th.  It&#39;s now been two weeks.  Did not have any symptoms in arm this time.  Swelling was less after a couple days, did not get &#34;hard&#34; like after first dose.  Also, did not get COVID Arm after second dose like I did a week or so later after first dose.  Am blood type A.  Had only minor side effects after second dose - pressure behind eyes and fatigued, for about 30 hours which began about six hours after second dose.  Did not get fever, chills or anything like that.

                                                Roughly 48 hours after receiving the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccination I developed a bright red skin rash.  The rash appeared first in the Elbow joint (antecubital fossa) area of the right and left arm and then also appeared behind the right and left knee.  The rash presents as a bright red rash with raised bumps that almost appear as small blisters. The rash produces a significant itch.  Taking a OTC antihistamine (Benadryl) has relieved the itching and some of the raised bumps have subsided however the rash remains visible. As of this writing the rash has been present for 48&#43; hours.

Hot flashes and perspiration that I have never experienced.  Felt somewhat better day 2 but its now day 4 and I am still experiencing fatigue and hot flashes.  I cannot go out and do normal yard work without feeling fatigued. I am unable to put a full day of normal work in due to fatigue. I never, ever, got hot to where I would have to take off my shirt just sitting inside. The only good thing about this second shot vs. the first one was my arm did not hurt as much at the injection spot.

I went to Clinic and the PA said it didn&#39;t appear to be a rash but what she thought was Petechiae.

My appointment is for 11:00 am this morning 4/12/2021.

Started feeling body aches in knees, legs, ankles.   Vax site on right arm was noticeably sore.    Had chills at 5:30 am when i woke up again (did not test for fever but was not sweating).   Fell back asleep until 8:30 and took 2 Advil and a 20 minute warm bath to help get rid of the chills.  Slept another hour and then got up for my normal breakfast.   Groggy all morning, but symptoms appear to be completed now at 11:45 am.     I had somewhat stronger  and longer adverse reaction after the 1st vacine on 3/21/21.   I believe the fatigue, body aches and chills lasted throughout the following day and evening.      I had 1 Negative Covid test in June last year but my son and some friends of his tested positive in appx June 2020 so it&#39;s quite possible i had asymptomatic covid at some point in the last year (which i understand from news stories my drive higher adverse reaction rates).

It appears to be &#34;covid arm.&#34;  I had not looked at the injection site since the injection, so I do not know if it was red prior to May 6th. I took oral benedryl for one day, but stopped due to the drowsiness. I still have a mild red patch, but no itch as of the time of this report. (9am May 11,2021.)

                                                Since Shot - Arm pain at injection site continues through today.  Most intense issues were Tuesday 24 hours post shot when I had more intense headaches and body aches.  SOB remained the same.  Tuesday evening, 35 hours post shot, I had chills and low grade fever 99.3.  Slept for 10 hours and fever was gone and hasn&#39;t returned.  Intensity of arm pain is diminished but still quite sore at actual injection site.  Headaches are not as intense as Tuesday but continue to fluctuate in intensity as they have for the past 3 months.

                                                My left upper arm became itchy yesterday (14 days  after getting the vaccine).  The itch seemed to come from within or under the top layer of skin.  It was distinctly noticeable but not severe. The area was mildly itchy the entire evening. It was less itchy today (almost 24 hours later) - almost gone.  Around the injection site, there is a about a 2.5 inch circle where the skin is light pink (I am a white person). It seemed a little bumpy last night, but the skin is smooth to the touch now.

I began to notice small red dots to the front of my lower extremities. As each day followed the red dots became larger and have progressed to the calfs, and behind my tricep area. They do not hurt but occasionally itchy. I am applying Cortizone cream to the areas affected.         To your knowledge, has this rash been reported by anyone post vaccination?Should I be concern? Is it safe to take the second dosage? I am schedule to receive it February 18.

Around 6 PM that day, I started feeling fatigued and my body felt achy.  I felt like my breath and body were warm, as though I had a fever, but my temperature was normal.  Drinking a lot of water did not help the feeling go away.  On the second morning following the vaccination (about 42 hours after the injection), I felt fine, but around 6 PM (52 hours after the injection), I felt tired again but not achy.  On the third morning, the only symptom that I felt was very mild tenderness near the injection site.

After 45 minutes the redness abated and I came home,    1 March 2021 I came down with COVID symptoms with dizziness, blurry vision, redness, ringing in the ear and flu like symptoms of body aches.   Then the neuralgia in the dextral ulnar nerve increased and clawing started.  Then same happened on the sinistral ulnar nerve and Carpal tunnel in the other finders.  I feared going to sleep for fear of awaking with paralysis.  I drank vodka to calm myself down and Xanax to sleep (I know it is a dangerous combination).  2 March the red skin continues and when I awoke at 13:30 today I was still extreme and I called 911.  The EMS visited and determined my blood pressure and pulse were normal.  The dextral  ulnar nerve problems continue,

Also, experienced hot sensations and fever followed by chills with headache.  The fullness of effects occurred 4:00a.   Symptoms began to decrease over the next several hours, however, they remained low-grade for the next 48 hours.  Then I experienced exhaustion and congestion with minor intermittent cough as if I went from the flu to having a cold.  By the end of workday Thursday, 02/25/2021, I was considerably better.  Then the rash began (02/25/2021 evening) at first it appeared upper left arm and left side of chest spreading to the right chest and arm with a lesser degree.  Rash is described as minor itching, redness, and bumps appearing as a contact dermatitis.  As of 03/05/2021, it seems on its way to resolving.

                                                Typical flu-like symptoms for 30  hours.   During that time an increasing skin sensitivity over torso and limbs.  After 36 hours, a very obvious and bad rash on hands that doctor diagnosed as dyshidrotic eczema.  Simultaneously legs were badly marked with dark red dots, especially lower legs, and much overall light red skin over upper legs and torso below neck.  The hands resolved over a few days with steroid cream.  The rest of the body continues, a month later, to feel like a sunburn.  The worst of the look of dark red dots on lower leg diminished over the first couple of weeks.  But even now, it feels like my skin is mildly burned.  I can even press it and release and see white where I pressed, surrounded by red, just like a sunburn.  Overall the skin looks mildly red, but nothing outrageous.

                                                Approximately 25 minutes after shot administered: A single welt/hive appeared on my right thigh approx. 6? above my knee; was warm and raised. Dissipated after 1 hour; Re-appeared around 6 pm but less irritating. Not present today. (Haven?t had any hives in more than a decade.) Roof of mouth and ear canals became very warm and itchy...like an intensifying of my seasonal allergies. Continued to decrease after 7 pm; also used a cold milkshake to relieve the sensation between 5:15 pm and 6:00 pm. Both sides of my tongue swelled and were itchy.  Symptom subsided around 7 pm. Minimal pain at injection site; no redness No fever, no headache.

                                                The purpose of this note is to report the rash side affect I had after the first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine that I received in the clinic. I received the vaccine 4/1/2021 about 8 PM. Today&#39;s date is 4/5/2021. I can send a picture if that would be helpful. One thing to be aware of is that I almost always get a body rash and minor body aches when I start to get sick or when I get very run down. Rest has always taken care of it. This red rash is brighter red than I have had before and it feels like a mild to medium sunburn, which has not occurred in the past. The rash started one day after receiving the vaccine. The second day it covered most of my body and got much brighter red and, as mentioned, felt like a sunburn. The third day was about the same, but later in the day (today)it appears to be slowly fading.

                                                I had common side effects including fever of 102.7, joint pain, body aches, headache, stomach pain  from the evening of 4/3/21 until today, 4/6/21. The fever has fluctuated from no fever to102.7, to lower grade 99.1 to 100.5 to no fever to lower grade, 99.1 over the course of that time. The reason for my VAERS report is the major rash that I developed on the evening of 4/5/21 that covers my entire back, my chest, and up to the first two inches of my neck. I contacted my physician practice right away, and recommended that I take Benadryl every few hours. This morning, the surface area of the rash remains the same as yesterday, but is a much lighter hue. Yesterday was deep red and felt very hot. Today, is more of a pinkish red. Today my back feels as if I have a bad sunburn. Clothing touching my back causes a discomfort similar to sunburn. Parts of my back also now have white dryness lines/wrinkles.

                                                In a nutshell, patient was fine, got the first shot of the Moderna Vaccine on 3/24/21, then began to exhibit many covid-like symptoms starting around 4 hours later but 3 times nasal swap tested negative for COVID19 including before and after vaccination. Suffered with various attempts at treatments and tests for approximately a month and then was admitted to the ER at hospital on 4/28/21.  Wife (former smoker who lives in same house and has lung problems) who took the vaccine at the same time from the same lot suffered minor arm pain, aches and pains and fatigue but was fine the next day.  Patient (59) had normal blood pressure and clear lungs in good health, non-smoker, good weight, exercises regularly and strenuously, good diet, rarely gets ill. He works as a ship?s captain and engineer and has worked in boatyards for years doing physical work. Has tintinnitis and in one eye, glaucoma drops but is on no other prescription medicines. Details: March: had nasal congestion, cough and suspected bronchitis, aches and pains, no fever, PCR tested negative for COVID19, and was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin and then a run of amoxycillin), proair, advair discuss a couple of days, various vitamins/minerals, over the counter cold/flu medicines. Seemed to work with most symptoms going away prior to Marcch 24, 2021. March 24, 2021 morning: Got first shot of the Moderna Vaccine at pharmacy. Lot 045A21A at same time as spouse. That morning had no cough and felt ok. Approximately 4 hours later, patient started to cough, felt congested, felt like flu/pneumonia, trouble breathing, aches and pains especially in joints, extreme fatigue, headache, (but suffered no loss of taste or smell throughout 3/24-present) took Theraflu and went to bed early, slept well. Following days, struggled with intensifying symptoms. Felt like the vaccine gave him covid symptoms without the loss of smell/taste.  Spouse experienced minor pain at point of injection, some fatigue, aches and pains which went away by end of next day 3/25/21. Spouse had some lingering cough left over from earlier bronchitis before getting the vaccine which cough/congested breathing continued with no noticeable change. [Spouse was also not adversely impacted by the second shot of Moderna vaccine a month later.) Apr Wk1 &amp; Wk2: Increasing difficulty sleeping due to lung congestion or suddenly waking up wide awake for no reason. At end of Wk2, had some minor tremors in muscles for a couple of days. Suffered from extreme fatigue, congestion, trouble breathing, nightmares, aches and pains. Took azithromycin run then a run of amoxicillin, proair, prednisone, albuterol nebulizer, occasional Theraflu or over-the-counter cold/flu medicines, vitamins/minerals (including heavier doses of Vitamin D, Zinc, C, etc.), probiotic acidophilus, tonic water with quinine or Perrier, melatonin 10mg and magnesium 500mg at night, occasionally a Unisom sleeping pill. Started to lose appetite where rarely hungry. Would force himself to eat anyway, but occasionally vomited it up. Apr Wk3 4/13/21: Patient got another PCR covid test which was negative, chest xray, blood work done at Urgent Care. Showed some elevated liver/kidney enzymes and low red blood cell count/anemia, vague thickening of the plura, swollen lymphnode in the chest xray, no sign of cardiovascular issue. (Some yellow flags but nothing flashing red.) Dr. recommended followup tests and bloodwork and that he get GI/Cardio/pulmonary workups w/specialists. Patient continued to take antibiotics, pregnizone, albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals, and occasional cold/flu/cough medicines, etc. Added SuperB Complex. One day he had hot/cold chills for a few hours. Apr Wk4: While lungs felt clearer, still coughing and now occasionally vomiting productively or dry heaves, insomnia grew into bigger issue with hallucinations not just with nightmares but occasionally during the day where it was difficult to separate reality from dream, trouble remembering, started to feel paranoid/irrational sometimes, trouble sleeping was not due to lung congestion but more due to panic-attack like heavy breathing or sudden central chest/sternum pain (maybe from coughs), aches in joints, but biggest problem was extreme fatigue and tiring when walking up a flight of stairs, etc. Took some Tramadol occasionally for pain relief (but never with aspirin, Tylenol or cold medicine). Could be sitting comfortably watching a mellow tv program but suddenly need to breathe really heavy, hyperventilating and felt need to standup and walk around until it eased. Extreme trouble sleeping. Most comfortable position was kneeling with body bent over a pillow on the bed. [He&#39;d never had panic-attacks/heavy breathing issues before the Moderna shot and doesn&#39;t abuse substances.] Wk5: 4/24/21 feet swelled up and turned purple on the soles. Went for a walk around the block and raised feet. No longer on antibiotics or pregnizone, only taking the albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals/probiotics, melatonin and a OTC cough/flu medicine before bed. Knelt for hours while trying to sleep. 4/25/21, feet more swollen with fluid and more discolored. When searched online, they looked like &#34;covid toes&#34;. Took no medicines except nebulizer and took only a couple of vitamins/calcium-vitaminD and before bed a beer, melatonin, magnesium &amp; nyquil. 4/26/21, feet less swollen and no longer purple except a small line on the side of one foot. Patient indicated he had not knelt when trying to sleep prone during night. But only got a couple of hours of sleep, nighttime hallucinations and panic-breathing attacks. Daytime inability to focus, extreme fatigue, aches and pains, quick to tire on any exertion, vomiting food or dry heaves 2 or 3 times that day, panic-like-attacks with need to heavy breathe/hyperventilate. Wheezing with occasional rattle at end. Coughs sometimes productive, sometimes not but lungs didn?t feel very congested and oxygenation/blood pressure was good. 4/27/21, went to work in morning and was able to perform but very tired. In early afternoon, came home, ate, took nyquil and nebulizer and tried to sleep. 4/28/21, felt much worse, feet and knees swollen, extreme exhaustion, felt miserable. Went to work anyway. Came home around 2pm, ate. Felt much worse so we went to the ER at Hospital. Spouse provided MMC with his medical conditions, medicines, the info on COVID IGG serology test and informed them of the chest xrays and bloodwork that had been done at the Urgent Care center 2 weeks prior. ER indicated he needed to stay overnight and they performed additional bloodwork, xrays, scans and MRIs. The ER doctor called in specialists in Nephrology and Cardiology to provide consultations.

                                                Had covid infection Dec 2020  He received Moderna shot#1 on 2 Apr 2021: received shot, waited 15 min, went home (30 min drive), went bike riding outdoors, stopped riding after 15 min due to cold weather, went inside, while undressing for shower he noted redness of skin from waist up involving trunk and face, called nurse hotline, while talking to her he felt scratchy throat, was advicse to call 911, 911 responded in 5 min, transport to Hospital, arrived ER in 5 min, given IV Benadryl but not epi. VS were nl on admission to the ER. He denies dizziness, sob, cough, wheeze, chest tightness, diarrhea, abd cramping. Flushing improved over a period of five hours, discharged while still residually flushed. Redness fully resolved over two days.   The redness of his skin was similar to what he experienced after an allergic reaction to a food spice in 2003.    He has covid infection in Nov2020, had high fever, lost taste and smell. Self-treated w/ Tylenol at home, had &#43; positive at Clinic (results verified on Database)   Flushing and respiratory sx within an hour of receiving Moderna covid vaccine #1, in setting of a previous clinical infection/positive covid PCR testing in Dec2020, suggests anaphylaxis to Moderna vaccine. He may have developed ab during actual infection that caused IgE reaction to vaccine.  I advised him to avoid further covid vaccines until further developments  He is most likely immune given previous clinical infection and positive PCR testing and receiving one vaccine.  It is unknown how long immunity will last, what current covid ab titers mean, and whether he might be able to take an alternate vaccine in the future. He might merit skin testing with Miralax in anticipation for further PEG2000 containing vaccines in the future.  Fol allergy at Location Note written 25 May 2021 during appointment w/ patient

                                                Starting within a week of my second vaccine does, I experienced generalized pain in my upper body, especially arms/shoulders. At perhaps the 10-day mark (I&#39;m not sure) I developed rashes on the right side of my face (chin, next to mouth, temple, two places near ear, one place in ear canal. They became worse and more painful as did my upper body pain. I finally went to a Walk-In Clinic on Thursday, May 27 (15 days after my second vaccine shot) and was diagnosed with shingles. I am not taking medication for it to try to speed it along, and the rash is not as painful (five days later), but my upper body is still experiencing the same symptoms as the shingles takes its course. I am reporting this at the advice of a friend because I know of at least five other people within friend circles who also came down with shingles within three weeks or less of their second vaccine dose (in my case, I think symptoms did start to appear within about a week, definitely before 10 days).  I&#39;m wondering how widespread this pattern is.

                                                After second injection on 6/3/2021, I felt fine. Upon waking on 6/4, I had a fever of 101, severe headache and body pain. On 6/5, I developed a 5? x 5? irritated red patch on my injection arm. On 6/6 I awoke to no fever. I then noticed sores in my mouth and busies on my abdomen, left leg and left foot. I went to urgent care. They ran a CBC. My platelet count was down 30% since ,my last test a few months ago. My average was about 180,000 for the last 6 years. My test number was 127,000.  I have no history of a low platelet count. This appeared within days of the 2nd vaccination along with the sores and spontaneous bruising. A CAT and v,MRI were performed that same day. Those tests were normal.
