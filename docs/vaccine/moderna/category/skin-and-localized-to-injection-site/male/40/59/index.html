                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

On 1/12/21 I experienced SOB/labored breathing for approximately 24 hours. O2 sat did not go below 95%. HR was between 80 and 105 for approximately four hours (75 is a typical resting heart rate). No history of asthma, but I felt how people with asthma describe difficulty breathing. Given the length of time between the dose and the SOB, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the vaccine. But I am submitting this just in case you end up with other, similar reports. Thank you.

                                                The shot was administered in my left arm.  I experienced localized swelling and axillary lymph node tenderness immediately after injection under my left armpit.  The right side of my face also became numb for about 5 minutes.  The next morning the areas around my eyes were swollen and I had two styes in my right eye.  I do not know if these were related.  These symptoms lasted approximately 3 days.  Some minimal swelling and tenderness seemed to remain, and approximately a week later I experienced a painful resurgence of the swelling at the injection site that was far larger, harder and more painful.  I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen.  These relieved the symptoms within 48 hours.

Seems very delayed from time of vaccination but have not used any new products, soaps, detergents, or any other unusual/new foods or medicines.

                                                Initially, no immediate problems other than slightly tender at injection site. Approximately 48 hours later (evening 01/14/2021) started to notice increased inflammation about the size of a &#34;quarter&#34; on left side of chin. I did have a pimple/ingrown hair at this site prior to the injection which was mostly healed but not entirely healed. The next morning, 01/15/2021, I experience mild facial numbness to the left side of my chin and mild facial paralysis resulting in an asymmetrical smile, and mild swelling to the left side of my face. Two day later (morning 01/17/2021) with my symptoms not worsening but showing only a little improvement, I went to my local urgent care for evaluation. Provider was not 100% sure of the diagnosis but felt this could be a case of shingles or folliculitis. I was treated with a 7 day course of acyclovir and a 10 day course of doxycycline hyclate. The numbness subsided 2-3 days after treatment began. The facial paralysis and swelling showed much improvement (90-95%) after completing the acyclovir on 01/24/2021; however, I feel there is still a little more improvement to go.

Then one week later on 1/26/2021 I started having vaccine shoulder itchiness I didn&#39;t think anything of it and then my arm swelled and got hot. The next day on 1/27/2021 it had a red area around it and was hot. I have never had a fever or anything else except minor pain the day after the vaccine.  I continued ibuprofen and benadryl at night it took the itch away and was bearable. I want to know if I should get the second shot? I have it scheduled for 2-15-2021 @ 2:00 pm PST I also have pictures

Took ibuprophen 400 mg  (morning of the 2/3 and evening of 2/3) for headache with relief and took Nyquil (night of 2/2) for chills and to help sleep with minimal relief.  Symptoms were sever enough that I donot feel like I would have been able to go to work that day.

                                                Beginning approximately one day after shot administration, I developed a red lesion at the injection site around 2 inches in diameter.  Around day 5, this went away.  Then, around day 8, the lesion returned, and is now about 3 inches in diameter. Both times, the lesion was red, itchy, burning, and painful to touch.  The lesion appears to be consistent with reports of &#34;COVID Arm&#34; seen in some instances after receiving the Moderna shot specifically.

                                                I started with redness, very sore to touch, a hard knot and hot to touch around and below the injection site.  I took some ibuprofen and cold compresses to the site.  It went away for a couple of days and then returned with the same symptoms.  It is still there as of today, but the knot is gone.  I just have redness and heat to that area.

                                                It has been 6 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. For the first 3-4 days I had the usual moderate flu-like symptoms:  dizziness, headaches, fatigue, chills, soreness at vaccine siteetc.  Days 5-7 I seemed to gradually improve. On day 8 all of the symptoms returned with greater severity: this time I had a fever, the chills were much more intense, the headaches were excruciating, body and joint aches all over the place--I couldn&#39;t sleep or focus on anything cognitively taxing.  Interestingly, my brother, who was vaccinated just after me, also had more severe side effects beginning on day 8 post 2nd dose. He improved after 3-4 days, but my recovery has been much much lengthier. By day 14 I was still feeling very ill, though the fever did subside.  Sometime in the third week the pain in my arm at the vaccination site returned, then became intermittent, and still bothers me from time to time. I also started getting muscle spasms in the same exact locations that sent me to the ER after my probably bout with Covid in the spring of 2020. Thankfully these lasted only a week or so, though I began feeling muscle soreness in different parts of my body, ever changing. By the 4th week I was slightly better and down to 4 main symptoms: chills (by far the worst of the symptoms--to the point at which my skin would feel like it was being frostbitten by dry ice every time I changed sweaty clothes), occasional splitting headaches, and muscle soreness that included both the injection site on my arm and other areas.  I had other symptoms as well, fatigue and brain fog, etc, but these were present before the vaccination, though not as severe.

                                                It was my second shot.  It is two days later and the injection area now covered by a 2-3inch diameter red swollen rash.  It looks like a red circular patch.  Warm to the touch.

Second day is a little better with a little more mobility, but trying to undress and undress is torture, especially lifting my arm over my head or past my chest.

                                                A little less than 3 hours after getting the shot, I noticed the injection site was getting very sore. Within about a half hour of first noticing it, that entire muscle was aching a lot. It?s now 4:50pm and it hurts to lift my arm, reach for anything, I can even feel it just by typing this out. I?ve also noticed I?m pretty tired, my joints feel very achey like when I have a cold, and I?m incredibly thirsty. The pain in the muscle at injection site is by far the worst symptom though. It?s extremely painful. I did not expect that since it didn?t hurt when getting the actual shot. Took my temp and it?s normal. The aching joints are far less painful than my arm, but are an issue nonetheless. Had I known this would happen beforehand, I would still get the shot, so as long as it doesn?t get a lot worse or something else haplens, all in all I?d have to say it was worth it.

The next day I was so exhausted I couldn&#39;t work for 2 days.  I barely got out of bed until about 40 hours after the shot where I was able to get out and do some gardening.   The reason I am filling this out was at right around 72 hours after the vaccine, I was laying down watching a YouTube video feeling quite relaxed.  I then experienced a tachycardia event where my heart rate went up to 120 and stayed there for about an hour.  I remained calm and was not experiencing anxiety, but the heart rate persisted.  I have had this happen before in panic attacks, but it&#39;s quite rare and I am in acute, high level stress.    Almost 2 weeks later to the day, I had another tachycardia, stronger than any I&#39;ve had my entire life that only lasted about 7 seconds, but I would estimate my heart rate jumped to over 250.   I thought I was going to go into cardiac arrest it was so jarring.  I&#39;m not sure if that one was related to the vaccine.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

Hives at torso after 10 minutes.   I was assessed by to physicians working at the site.   Epi pen was given to me by a physician and taken by ambulance to hospital by EMTs who were there at the site.  At the hospital I was given 40mg steroids by mouth.  After observation for 4 hours I was feeling better, and was discharged home.   Ordered to take 40mg of steroids for 2 more days.  After one day post vaccination, I have significant pain at the site and body ache.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

                                                Patient is a 41 y.o. male on no AC/AP with no pmhx reported presents 1/31 PM initially to Hospital for acute onset 10/10 headache refractory to 800mg motrin which started in occipital region then spread to whole head and neck, nausea and vomiting x 3. Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

As of today 03/11/21, I continue to have the rashes.

                                                It was the Moderna Vaccine. I had a prescheduled meeting to get some tests done on the Monday, following my vaccine (02/22/2021). The results of those labs showed a severe inflammatory response. My blood platelet levels were at 27, and my CRP was at 15. I started bruising easily, which I have never done before, and I had serious body aches and fatigue. I met with Dr.  on Tuesday, March 16, 2021 to do some follow up tests. At this point, my platelet levels were up to 96, much improved, but still low. He said that it could very likely be connected to the vaccine. I had the first dose on January 23, 2021, and the second dose on February 20, 2021. I now have to get additional tests to see if these levels improve.

                                                Went to ED 3/30/21  Immediately after receiving the second vaccine 2/25 he developed chest tightness and joint pain. The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma and Hyperthyroidism. Concomitant products included FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE (FLOVENT) for an unknown indication.   On 22-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out to sleep at 745 pm) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 19-Apr-2021 at 11:30 PM, the patient experienced COLD SWEAT (cold sweats), ASTHENIA (really weak), DYSSTASIA (could barely stand up) and ILLNESS (sick to his stomach). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VERTIGO (head spinning), DIZZINESS (dizzy), FATIGUE (tired), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (pain at injection site) and NAUSEA (nauseas).

Temp taken at 10p (99.1, my normal is 97.6) By 0150, temp up to 100.4 along with continuing alternating sweats/chills and persisting headache. 1000mg Tylenol used at 0150.  At 0240, symptoms settle a bit and got a little sleep. 0445, woke up- headache persists. Mild chills/sweats. Afebrile at 98.6. Still fatigued. At 0800 on 1/5/21, another 1000mg Tylenol used as aforementioned symptoms worsening.  Now at 1035 (time of this report), chills/sweats have settled - left with fatigue, headache, and nasal congestion.

On 1/12/2021, upon removing shirt at approximately 4:00 PM, silver dollar sized area of induration , hotness, pain and erythema noted at injection site.  No fever was observed. Contacted ID MD at employer and informed him of the findings.  He advised it could be an immune mediated response vs. cellulitis. Went to Urgent Care site on 1/13/2021 and was dx with cellulitis and was prescribed cephalexin 500 mg PO TID x 10 days.  By 1/16/2021, induration, pain, and erythema has resolved.  Interestingly, injection site is still a bit warmer than the surrounding tissue.

                                                On January 25 I noticed a rash/hives on my chest and abdomen area.  It has been almost 24 hours and they have not resolved.  The severity is about a 3 out of 10, they have remained localized and are only mildly itchy.  I have no other symptoms and I have not altered my daily routine or interacted with anything which could explain the hives.  I have not been ill for over 6 months but the rash reminds me of after recovering from a virus when it is shedding.  I spoke with a healthcare provider and he suggested I file a report.

BP first reading in left arm was 235/130 with a HR around 130. Second reading was 205/120 with HR in 120&#39;s about 4 min later.  I requested an ambulance due to the feeling of being very unwell and dizzy.  Trouble concentrating.    Ambulance ride was 190/112 ish EKG and BP monitoring at hospital.   No anaphalaxis diagnosed but unknown cause.   ER discharge after benadryl.    BP and HR would continue to cycle up and down for the next  18 hours.   Red spot formed about 2 inches away from where I was injected.      PCP and allergist thin it was an intravascular injection.

Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

I call the nurse line and requested a CBC.  On 2 February, the Emergency Department called me back and stated my platelets were at 6K (over the last 10 years with CLL, they consistently are at 110K-120K).  The emergency department directed me to come in and began treatment with Prednisone and platelet transfusion.  I was transferred to Hospital  where they started IVIG and 40mg of Dexamethasone for four days.  I was discharged on 7 February with stable platelets at 42K

                                                It cause me to have three blisters on my left shoulder. When I remove the band-aid , I notice that my pieces of my skin were removed as well. There was still one blister that had not burst yet. The other two had bursted leaving me to have an open sore as though someone had burned my skin. I immediately contacted the facility that administered the shot to me. They then advised me to go to the nearest Urgent care for treatment. Upon my arrival, treated me for the scaring from the Moderna injection.  provided with an oniment to be applied daily until the sore/blister is healed.

                                                I received my first Covid-19 Moderna injection and felt slightly groggy and tired as the day progressed. Just before bed I noticed my arm was quite sore and I still felt tired and slightly light headed. The next day (Feb 4) I had a very sore left arm at the injection site but felt good otherwise. I came home from work and took one 200mg Ibuprofen as my arm was still quite sore. The following day (Feb 5) my arm pain subsided but I still felt light headed during the evening. I am writing this on Feb. 18th and each day I have bouts of being light headed and have difficulty concentrating. There is no real pattern to what time of day I get the symptoms. I do not have the classic headache but definitely feel pressure in my head and behind my eyes. I also find that I wake up after a full nights sleep and feel not well rested. I spoke with my doctor last week and he suggested I give it until this week to see where things are at. I plan on contacting him soon to schedule an appointment to discuss my symptoms more. Before getting the vaccine I did not have any of these symptoms as I describe.

                                                The person who stuck me with that needle injected the vaccine way too high and the entire dose wound up inside my shoulder socket and now I cant use my arm. I know exactly what happened because I&#39;ve had my other shoulder broken no less than three times. I know exactly what a shoulder socket full of fluid feels like. There is no discerible swelling it redness, and absolutely none of the bruise-like pain normally associated with any if the dozens of vaccinations a person gets throughout their lifetime. The pain is inside my shoulder and comes from trying to use my arm. It feels like my arm is going to come out if the socket if I so much as move my arm away from my body. If this person is doing this to other people then he needs to be stopped ASAP. No names were given. He is a shorter male, medium build, darker skin, (far as I could tell from the PPE), and spoke with a slight accent.

                                                Woke early one morning to a large painful lump on my right forearm. The lump was painful and felt like it was causing my arm to twist. Some hours later, my entire right arm was covered with large, painful, black and purple bruising. I had never experienced anything like this in my life. I often see blood in my urine, and during this time there was an unusually large amount. I don&#39;t know how to describe the feeling of lumps moving through my body, but I could definitely feel the movement through my arms and legs.

On way home my lips started to tingle a bit and I felt warmer over my body. I got home and felt exhausted for multiple days but on the first day I could not sleep. By the weekend I was just worn out and slept all day the following Sat and Sunday.  My arm hurt so bad I couldn?t lay on it and I even  today either have phantom arm pain or real arm pain. But I know where the shot was because I feel it. It still feels like a deep tissue bruise.

                                                One week after the shot, I developed a red, slightly swollen area around 2 inches in diameter at the injection site (left shoulder).  My shoulder itched greatly for about a day.  The redness went away in about a day and the itchiness subsided over the next 2-3 days. I continued to feel strange sensations in my shoulder and arm for several days.

Symptoms began Saturday, 4/10; pt was helping her mother around her house; was not straining excessively; however, later that day had a sudden burning sensation in her lower-mid back, which has since been recurring in paroxysms.  At times it spreads into the posterior thighs but not into the feet; sometimes also spreads upward into the upper back and just below the chin.  In between attacks, there is no pain or numbness.  There has never been weakness. No urinary/bowel incontinence or saddle anesthesia; sphincter tone was normal.  NIF/FVC normal -60, 2.3L.  Paroxysmal pain controlled w/ 600mg gabapentin q8h since being hospitalized.  There has been no development or progression or symptoms, still only pain and normal neurologic and physical exam.

                                                The first day I was fatigued and achey for a few hours and wanted to go to sleep very early.  The following two days my arm was sore at the injection site but that went away in a couple days.  3 days post vaccination, my right axilla and median and ulnar nerves were extremely sensitive for 3 days but that subsided.  6 days post vaccine I started to get extreme fatigued, low energy and feel like my nerves were hot.  I got a covid test which was negative because I was not feeling well.  Then 9 days post vaccine I started to feel very fatigued, achey, and I couldn?t sleep well and like my nerves were burning up all over my body.  I had to call out of work due to brain fog, fatigue, nerve heat, difficulty concentrating.  I took my temperature during all this and it was 97.7.  My hands felt very hot and I could wash them under warm water because the water felt way too hot.

                                                Left Arm became very sore.  Left Bicep had deep ache and spasm. I developed a large painful knot under the skin.  As time went on the are immediately at injection site got red and inflamed. By Thursday the redness transversed the width of my arm. Friday a large red ring began to go around injection site and the center began to be less red and then appeared blanched.  The Ring was maybe 4&#34; x 8&#34; which got more inflamed through Saturday. By Sunday the ring was still there, but less inflamed.  I did not take any medication except Tylenol starting on Thursday at 10:00 AM as I developed 102.8 fever until Friday morning.  I did experience Headache and chills, but I considered that minor compared to my arm and the local reaction that occurred. I did not go  to Doctor, but rather waited to inform medical staff at my employer, as I am a healthcare worker.

I woke up on January 23rd, 2021 at approximately 0800 hours and felt general soreness in my muscles and joints. By 0900 hours, joint pain was much worse as it hurt just to stand. At approximately 1130 hours, I started feeling chills. I wore two layers of sweatshirts and sweatpants plus blankets. I could not get warm. By approximately 1300 hours, I had a low grade fever of 100.3 - 100.6. I went to bed at approximately 2200 hours, woke up at approximately 1030 hours  on Sunday the 24th, 2021 and had no longer felt the pain, chills or fever.

Progressed to left hand and other joints (knees) by 4th day. Use of acetaminophen helped alleviate  pain and permitted more movement.   By day 6,  pain  reduced to no longer need medication. As of Today,  joints are still not back to normal still slightly tight. Injection site was sore for 5 days.

Sometimes I break out in the middle of the night if my bed gets a little warm. I never had problems with any of those things before the shots.

He didn&#39;t sleep well, and this morning his sleep app indicated his heart rate during the night was between 100-110.  After noticing his heart rate was between 130-140, he called the clinic and was told to go to the ER.  Hospital ER administered several tests and did blood work. The MD&#39;s determined his heart was fine and it is likely vaccine related.  He is home again and is feeling better (no chills, etc.) and his resting heart rate is now in the low-90&#39;s.

In fact it has gotten worse, now my arm feels week, my fingers tingle and the burning sensation radiates to my neck and left ear.  I been to the emergency room, VA clinic, and local clinic and nobody has helped me. Everyone just tells me to take ibuprofen, Tylenol, naproxen, use hot and cold compressions. Nothing has helped, If someone can call me and help me I will really appreciated.

                                                I experienced two separate adverse reactions.   First adverse reaction occurred on 2/11/21 at 5:00 am (after receiving my second shot of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine).  I experienced tachycardia with an approximate heart rate of 175 bp for approximately 30 minutes.  I was able to lower my heart rate down with 25 mg of quick release metoprolol.   Second adverse reaction started on 2/21/21.  I developed shingles on my lower left side.  It appears the shingles originated from my L1 dermatome.  At the current time 2/10/21 I am still recovering from my shingles.

                                                After 24 hours, I started having body aches, that night couldn&#39;t sleep I took Ibuprofen it helped, over the weekend I kept taking Ibuprofen. Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                Severe Headache within 1 hour of vaccination (01/20/21 @1330hours), followed by a slight fever within 6 hours and fatigue. Overnight, I experienced severe chills and body aches, and severe fatigue, which followed the rest of the morning (01/21/21) with general discomfort. By that early afternoon the chills subsided, and I continued to feel body aches with minimal joint pain. By 4 pm, I began to develop an itchy rash on my left wrist under my wristwatch, left hand and on my right forearm. I experience fatigue throughout the rest of the day. I used over the counter Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream to alleviate the itch.  On the Morning of 01/22/23, I woke up to a itchy rash over my torso and my hands. I continued to apply the cream and I took an OTC Benadryl allergy pill, which seems to subside the rash.  On 01/23/21, I woke up the the same  rash over my feet and overall, the rash over my torso and hands had substantially subsided.

                                                After the first day there was the typical site injection pain. Three Tylenol on the next day seem to take care of that but the pain quickly moved to the Front and top of the right pelvic bone. No amount of Tylenol has seem to do anything with that pain. After a week it seem to start to migrate to the left front top pelvic bone. These symptoms were mild and I was still able to carry out my daily activities in law-enforcement.  Friday night January 22 is when I started to have pulsating pressure in the back of my head, chills, dizziness, excessive urination, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. The symptoms have persisted through today but are starting to ease. I took a COVID-19 test on Sunday, January 24 the results came back today as Covid negative.

When I got home my temperature 100.1, I have nausea, body aches, chills. I have been coughing as well.  I contacted my primary care, they recommended to treat the symptoms and it should go away in a day or two.

                                                I received the dose on Friday 1/29.  About 45 minutes after the left side of my face felt numb.  Over the weekend I then thought I was developing acne (which is strange because I don&#39;t get acne).  By Monday it was getting terrible on the left side of my face and by bedtime I thought it was shingles.  I went to my general practitioner on Tuesday 2/2 and was diagnosed with shingles and prescribed Famciclovir 500 mg 3 x daily for 7 days.

                                                My left deltoid muscle is still aching at 7 weeks after this first injection.  I first noticed after 5-6 days when the expected initial pain of the shot subsided. I thought it would go away soon, but only realized that it would not when my right shoulder was fine 3 days after my 2nd shot. I have received my 2nd COVID vaccine 4 weeks after on Feb 9 in the right deltoid. There is no aching or adverse effects in my right arm at the time of this report.  I have reason to believe that the first shot was given too high in the left shoulder and possible SIRVA is the result in my left deltoid shoulder joint.   I use ibuprofen 800mg 3x daily, and that doesn?t take all the aching away. It is a persistent ache that doesn?t interfere with my ability to work, yet it limits my ability to do upper body exercises.

                                                5 days after injection I noticed a hive on my stomach.  The hives spread to additional areas of body over the next 24 hours including the face, scalp, neck, arms, back, and additional hives on chest.  This morning the majority are focused on my head and face area.  I&#39;ve double checked everything and haven&#39;t eaten or been in contact with anything out of the ordinary.    Also want to point out I had Covid in October 2020.  Also, I had a very sore arms for 2 days after shot along with exhaustion the 2nd day and a fever/chills (103 degrees) on my second night after injection.

One week after vaccine I had blood work done and my liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were.  On 3/23 I admitted myself to ER with jaundice and vomiting.  My liver levels were normal but bilirubin was still high.  At this point I had lost 30 pounds since my shot.   I was in the hospital for 5 days where the ran UT, CT, and MRI on my abdomen with none showing issues.   Jaundice and itchiness/jaundice got progressively worse.   The hospital ran multitude of blood tests to pin point the issue and even did a liver biopsy.  No tests showed anything abnormal but biopsy isn?t back yet.  At this point 4/1/21, I am still jaundiced, extremely itchiness, lethargy and a total of 33 pounds weigh loss.

No rash, hives, or scratching, just mild itchy skin. These symptoms are not frequent, and have not existed prior to the injection.

Later in the day, while at work, I became extremely fatigued and my chills were getting worse.  I left work early, came home and checked my temperature.  It has been between 102.5 and 103.7 the entire time I have been home.  Even after taking Tylenol.  My arm is also a little tender at the injection site.    I had COVID prior to this but they say I recovered.    My symptoms started on November 13 and was hospitalized for 3 days starting around day 9 of symptoms.  My current symptoms are pretty much identical to the symptoms I had when I first contracted COVID.

The staff member monitoring saw me going to the floor and called the head doctor over to help.  They called EMT&#39;s.  I was laid onto the floor on my back and legs up onto a chair.  The staff took my blood pressure which was low.  Approximately, 2 minutes later, they took my blood pressure and it went back up to a more normal level.  The EMT&#39;s helped me up and took my blood sugar levels and pulse oxygen levels which seemed normal.  I was able to feel better, but the color of my skin was yellowish and pale.  The EMT&#39;s suggested that I talk with my doctor before getting another vaccine and talk about my symptoms.

                                                Nearly two weeks after injection, I now have a 4 inch diameter circle of redness with slight swelling and itchy.  I noticed it after showering two days ago.  It almost looks like a localized allergic reaction but it did not appear until 2 weeks after the shot.  It is slightly warmer to touch than the rest of the area but it is not painful at all.  I had similar markings plus moderate pain around the injection site1-2 days after the shot but they quickly dissipated.  I am not sure if this should be reportable or not but I was a little concerned considering the amount of time that has passed since the shot and considering I am due for my second shot in a couple of weeks.

By 18 hours later my headache had worsened and i began to get light-headed. i drank tons of water and had no urination. I got hot and almost fainted. I had extreme uncontrollable shivering by 20 hours after injection. i nearly passed out at work. I also had nausea and burping.  By the next day(more than 24 hours after injection), I was completely fine.

                                                More than a week after my vaccine the arm near the injection site started getting sore and my body was achy. The next morning I woke up with it swollen, red, warm to the touch, huge knot covering most of my upper arm. I was also nauseous and a little bit of body aches.  Later that day the area that was red also began getting hives. I massaged it, applied a warm compress, and took Benadryl. The next day it was still sore but the redness wasn?t as bad or the arm wasn?t as swollen.  Later that night the redness and warm to the touch was completely gone .

                                                I didn&#39;t have any adverse affects until 5 days after I received the vaccination. Early in the afternoon on Wednesday 1/20 I noticed that my lymph nodes in the armpit of my left arm and on the left side of my neck were swollen and sore. This worsened as the day went on. I also noticed a pimple had formed and came to a head in the exact spot of where the needle stick had been. It &#34;popped&#34; that day and a small amount material came out. My lymph nodes have remained sore and swollen since 1/20. On the 7th day after (1/22) I noticed a couple of smaller, dime sized red blotches/rash on my left shoulder and left side of my neck. I also noticed that the injection site on my left shoulder was sore, swollen and hot to touch. On the 8th day (1/23) I noticed that there were more of these dime sized red blotches/rash across both shoulders, my back and a small area in the center of my chest.  It continues to be like that as of today (1/25). On the 9th day, (1/24) starting just after noon, I began to feel poorly. Achy and just generally not very good. I had a few bouts of diarrhea throughout the afternoon. I also had a pretty strong headache when I awoke on the morning of the 24th. Today, (1/25) I awoke again with a headache although it was not as sore as yesterday. I don&#39;t feel great today, but I do feel better than I did yesterday. The rash looks the same and my lymph nodes seem to be slightly less swollen and less sore.

I&#39;m not 100% sure, but I think there was slight oozing of fluid from the reaction site). No treatment administered, aside from taking  two, half-doses of diphenhydramine (half pill each time).

                                                Let me start by my wife also works at Tech and got the shot right before me.  So, I was comparing my symptoms to hers.  We both complained about pain and swelling at the injection shot but my swelling was much worse than hers.  You could tell that my shoulder was swollen just by looking at my arm with my shirt on.  So, I knew from talking to everyone that took it that my injection shit should hurt for a couple days so I thought that everything was normal.  Then after about a week it had not gone away and even started to hurt worse.  I have gotten to the point that when I have any type of physical activity my shoulder starts killing me.  It&#39;s real sharp pains that cause me to stop what I&#39;m doing and sit down and hold still until the pain fades.  So after about 11 days from the day of the vaccine my wife walked into the kitchen where I was trying to make dinner and had stopped and closed my eyes standing there in pain.  She said, if it hurts that bad you need to see a doctor.  So the next day I visited my doctor and he didn&#39;t really know what was causing it .  It had been 12 days since the injection and you can still slightly feel the  place in my arm.  He gave me a medium dose of  steroids and a antibiotic to see if something like that will help.  Early on I was putting ice packs on it and taking hot showers with the  hot water stream directly on my shoulder.  One strange thing about it is  it only hurts after/during activity and the pain is at other locations like running up my neck  and around the back of my shoulder.  I feel like it&#39;s something  with the joint or nerves because of that.  The only thing that seems to help is my not moving it.

Then severe rash over torso, arms, buttocks, thighs, and back consistent with what I experienced during Lyme Disease this past summer.  Raised itchy rash in large red blotches over most of body.  I didn&#39;t realize it at the time but the same (but less severe) reaction took place after the first Moderna Vaccine shot as well.  I was prescribed Doxycycline by my local Urgent Care and stayed on it for 14 days following the first dose of Moderna.  I didn&#39;t put the two things together immediately because I has gone hunting in the woods and assumed that I was bitten by another tick.  Full body rash is what caused me to go seek attention at the Urgent Care.  The symptoms following the second dose were much more severe and uncomfortable.  The rash subsided in 4-5 days without medication.

I then began feeling a severe pain in my left arm at the exact site of the injection that came and went depending on movement of my arm. It felt like a torn muscle. Now, 3 weeks after my final shot, the arm pain is still present and at times feels like it&#39;s worsening. It&#39;s at its most severe when reaching for something.

                                                After receiving my shot, I waited the half an hour. I felt a pinch in my head and tightness in shoulders and neck. Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

                                                On 3/16/21, I noticed a rash which closely mirrors what is being described as &#34;COVID arm&#34; at the site of the injection.  This appeared after 72 hours of severe stomach pain and loose stool, combined with fatigue, dizziness, chills/hot spells and lack of appetite.  There has been no fever with any of these symptoms.  The other members of my family who live in my household (Spouse - who also has had one dose of the Moderna vaccine, and our children age 12 and 15) all experienced the same set of symptoms, except the rash at site of vaccine injection.  I thought we had all caught a stomach bug from each other, but now I wonder if my symptoms were related to the rash that I first noticed this morning.

                                                On day 3 after the vaccine was given I had a local area of redness two inched wide develop. It gradually faded and went away, then after being completely gone for 3-4 days, on 1/11/21 another red blotch developed in the exact same spot, slightly bigger (2.5 &#34;) and a darker color (dark pink vs light pink). It is indurated like a positive TB test but bigger. there is no pain, no itching, and I otherwise feel well. I just thought it was odd to have the pink area completely go away then come back a few days later more intensely. I wanted to report it in case this helps people at the CDC better understand the vaccine side effects. I stopped getting texts from the Vsafe app after having several days of no side effects.

He complained of stiffness/tightness from the injection in left deltoid up the trapezius muscle to the back of the neck.  He told his wife he could not move his neck &amp; she began to massage the neck muscle. The muscle gradually loosened up with continued massage.  He also applied topical muscle rub (Tiger Balm) to the area and took some ibuprofen. When he reported to work later that morning he continued to complain of tightness and some discomfort in the left arm leading to the back of his neck, although from visual observation he did not to appear to be in any pain or discomfort or have any trouble moving his neck. Symptoms persisted for apx. two more days and was treated with topical rub, massage, and ibuprofen.

I was yelling at my wife and children.  This is very out of character for me and woke up this morning and had trouble recalling all the events of the previous night until my wife informed me of them.

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At approximately 9:30 PM (14 hours after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna), I started with chills and being cold. At the same time, I started a fever that gradually went up to 102.2 by 3:30 AM (20 hours after receiving 2nd dose). Also noticed a headache. At 3:30 AM I did take 2 extra strength Tylenol caplets.  Fever went down, but I did notice even 24-36 hours after receiving 2nd dose, my temperature was at 99.5-99.9.  The headache remained 24-36 hours but has since subsided now at 48 hours after receiving. I do still feel mild fatigue, but I reported to work without any issues. I did notice that my arm was hardly even sore compared to 1st dose received on Feb. 6, 2021.  One week after my 1st dose on Feb. 6, I developed the COVID rash which lasted 2-3 days and went away w/o any medication.   All in all, I did not find the side effects to be bad for either dose. I would do it all over again. The side effects were more of a nuisance than anything. I would have honestly reported to work as normal if it was during the week when I received vaccine. The side effects were not that bad.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

No other pain the day of injection. Day after injection (approximately 18 hours later) the entire right arm ached; then the aching moved to the lower back and eventually both legs. Pain resolved at approximately 30 hours after injection; ache never affected left (non-injected) arm.  Minor headache seemed to be forming, but never progressed past the initial indications. Was extremely tired the day following the injection; took two naps (1-2 hours each) and slept 12 hours that night (i.e., injected Friday, tired all day Saturday and slept longer than normal Saturday night). Aside from soreness at injection point, no further signs/symptoms on Sunday (i.e., resolved around 36 hours after injection).

These feelings lasted until 10pm on 1/16/21, and then I went to bed and felt better in the morning.  I was barely able to get out of bed that day (1/16) because of how sick I felt.  Besides the sick feeling,  I had bad pain at the injection site, and had a 3cm x 3cm raised red lump at the injection site.  This stayed painful for 48-60 hours, then the swelling subsided and was left with a bruise.

Tylenol and Benadryl took care of it fairly well.  Had arm pain at site of injection, like I was hit in arm with a baseball bat.  Had some gerd too but not sure if related. Tiredness started around 9 hours after the shot, but symptoms really kicked in about 12 hours after administration.  Lasted till about 46 hours after administration, at which time I woke up from overnight sleep feeling great.  Arm still sore and there might be some lingering joint pain but nothing to keep me from doing anything.

                                                Extremely painful/sore arm at the injection site occurred approximately 13 hours after the injection. Approximately 17 hours after injection, I experienced body aches in my lower back, hips, thighs, knees, and calves. I also began experiencing alternating and intermittent chills and sweats along with a mild to moderate headache. All of the previously mentioned symptoms lasted approximately 24 hours. After 24 hours passed, I experienced some coughing for approximately 12 hours before it passed.

I was out of my head with a little confusion and delirium for a few hours.  I experienced muscle aches and fatigue. I experienced itchy and crawly feelings on my skin.

                                                The day after the vaccination, I woke up with atypically cold and discolored red violet hands to wrists, lasting about six days. Irregular heart rhythm and breathing especially during sleep. Intense headaches for roughly 8 days, high blood pressure. Roughly days 4,5,6, being the worst for the headaches, blood pressure and rhythm.  Also, day 8 and 9 after the vaccination, sudden red spot on left arm, site of injection appeared, being itchy. Diminished day 10.   Day five and six  I was very concerned with out of synch breathing, headaches and high blood pressure.  Hands still flashes of being cold, and less severe headaches.

Got epi 0.3 mg IM, Decadron 10 mg IV, Zyrtec 10 mg, Pepcid 40 mg po, Benadryl 25 mg po, with improvement.  Allergy consulted, felt this was likely delayed hypersensitivity reaction to Moderna, but couldn&#39;t exclude lisinopril side effect.  They recommended Zyrtec 10 mg bid for 1 wk, and stay off lisinopril.  Will follow up in Clinic to determine how to approach 2nd shot.

On day 4, I developed a fever and chills. On day 5, I developed dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency and hesitancy. I have also had some low back pain and purulent urine. I have never had any urinary or prostate issues in the past and have regular annual physical exams. I am an emergency physician and had to work, so I started myself on Bactrim DS (I am avoiding floroquinolones due to numerous black box warnings). I have had several other episodes of hematuria during my treatment. I am on day 13 of Bactrim and my symptoms are improving. I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I have never had any similar issues and thought this should be reported.

However, suddenly 7 days after the injection, there was significant swelling ( 8cm) and pain at the injection site associated with a little feverish feeling. Lasted about a couple of days and subsided. Bringing it to agency&#39;s attention as there was none immediately after the injection, but something a week later on.

Nest day woke up with severe pain in left arm from below the site of injection (upper triceps) region down to the elbow , got severe enough to not be able straighten my arm fully without major discomfort.  Took Advil 800 mg , that made it better but not completely. By evening time felt like i was tired and like what i feel like when i am about to get a cold.   Next day was not tired , feeling of getting sick was no longer there and pain got slightly better by midday.   Next day after that woke up with slight swelling in the site and the arm was red and was warm to touch.  That continued for 2 days and gradually got less red and swollen and started to itch.  Took almost a week for the itch to completely subside.

                                                I had my second injection on Sunday morning 1/24/21 at 9:00 AM.  I was fine through the day.  The previous dose (dose #1) was on 12/29/20 and I became symptomatic the following day.  I had aches, malaise and fevers of 102.7 on 12/30/20.  The fevers lasted approximately 12 hours and resolved with Tylenol.  My left deltoid was very swollen and quite painful.  The swelling and pain resolved within 24 hours after the first injection.  Prior to dose #2 and through the day on 1/24, I used Tylenol and Celebrex, both medications were ingested at 8:45 and the tylenol wa again ingested at 11pm prior to going yo bed.  By 12:15, I had severe bilateral calf pain.  Fever started shortly after that.  Severe Headaches and Photophobia began at around 1 am.  I had a vey difficult time walking and was quite dizzy through the night.  Unable to sleep more than a couple of minutes at a time.  By 6:45 am, my fever was around 103.5.  I have used Tylenol and Ibuprofen since 1/25/21, 6:45 am.  both medications have been utilized around the clock on TID basis.  Fever dissipated by 1/25/21 evening.  Only a mild headache is present.  The injection site was swollen, indurated and painful to touch similar to cellulitis.  I have not used antibiotics, drew a line and have monitored the redness, it is slowly resolving.    By 17:30 on 1/26/21, I have a mild headache, mild malaise and chills.  No fever.  Arm is still swollen red and hot. I have not had respiratory or GI symptoms and have no history f Covid Exposure and have tested negative on multiple occasions.

I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence. I am fully vaccinated and this was by far my most severe vaccinal reaction.

                                                I experienced acute arm pain after injection that subsided within 48-72 hours.  Last night, on day 8, after five&#43; days of no pain whatsoever, and through the night to today (day 9) I am again experiencing acute arm pain similar to  the worst pain I felt in the days after the injection, both at the injection site and radiating down my arm and into my shoulder.  I took Tylenol which has provided some relief, but my range of arm motion is still limited by sharp pain.

No rashes or other side effects noted on 2/24/21 01:54 Nursing Progress Note, but 2/24/21 12:01 Nursing Progress Note stated ?There is a purple discoloration/rash/splotches on his arms and legs that PCP came to assess this morning?. PCP noted in retrospect, a similar event happened soon after his 1st vaccine dose - he received his first COVID-19 vaccine dose 1/26/21 at 13:00.  Nursing Progress note from 1/27/21 at 18:05, stated patient was transfered to ER for ??cool clammy skin and discoloration all over body?? (he was admitted for UTI, so it was thought his clammy discolored skin was associated with this acute illness) - He recovered from this first event without issue.

Now the last few weeks I have arthritis in my hands and fingers, also lower back cramps, and the last few days my left knee is hurting for no reason. I take aleve and it doesn&#39;t help. I wrapped it today in ace bandage and am using a cane. I am very upset. I have done nothing and this is all since the last shot.

Dr&#39;s did not think it was from 2nd dose, but they could not find another reason for Syncope and collapse.

                                                Patient got his Covid vaccine this past Thursday, 2 days ago.  He experienced typical side effects of a sore left shoulder and some fatigue but was feeling well until this afternoon around 1:55 PM when he noticed throbbing of his left hand.  He looked down and noticed that there was a purple discoloration to his middle finger and distal palmar aspect of his hand.  He felt like there was maybe some swelling as well and that he might have been having an allergic reaction so called the emergency department for further advice and came in for evaluation.  By the time I arrived to the emergency department the patient&#39;s left hand was no longer swollen and there was only a small purple discoloration to the palmar proximal middle finger.  I was concerned that the patient developed a small blood clot that was resolved upon evaluation.

                                                Early in the morning of January 9th, 2021, the day after receiving my first injection, I woke up in bed with extreme soreness and moderate swelling at the injection site. On a scale from one to ten, the level of discomfort was seven or eight. I had expected at least some soreness as I normally have soreness after receiving flu shots and other injections. However, I was very surprised as to how sore my arm really was. Fortunately, when I woke up the next day, January 10th, the pain had mostly subsided, with just a little swelling evident at the injection site.

The morning of January 12, 2021 I woke with severe muscle and joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue.  As the day progressed I developed chills to the point I could not get warm.  I also developed a low grade fever.  After taking two ibuprofen around 3p the pain subsided to an ache about my entire body by 9p, headache had subsided and I had no more chills or fever.  On the morning of January 13, 2021 I woke with a red rash going up the inside of both arms and around the outside of my upper arms and down my entire back.  As the day has progressed that rash has spread down the back of legs as well.  I did take one Benadryl with minimal effect.

As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

                                                Injection administered on 1/4/21 and was given in upper left shoulder joint opposed to the deltoid muscle. I completely removed my shirt to assure proper placement.  Common soreness to shot experienced next two days after administration, however soreness felt in shoulder joint rather than muscle. Pain re-occurred on 1/12/21 and has not been totally relieved despite the usage of anti-inflammatory medication eg. Ibuprofen 400mg,  Tylenol 500mg along with Ibuprofen for soreness. The worst pain I experience is when I go to sleep being prematurely awaken by aching and throbbing to my affected area. Again, not being any discomfort to muscle but rather left shoulder joint pain where sometimes I am discouraged from raising my left arm to my side. It does not bother me so much to raise my left arm towards my front. I have been working through my discomfort while being very careful not to aggravating it further. My concern comes from the fact that it has not completely gone away after the extended time frame and becomes more intense in the evening.

The Item 21 box for Doctor visit has been checked as I will meet with my primary care provider as soon as possible and have already discussed it with my employer&#39;s health department.

The patient developed headache, lack of taste, fatigue as well as the aforementioned rash on 1/14/2021(6 days after receiving first dose of covid vaccine.  A rapid covid test was positive on 1/14/2021 also.  The patient was prescribed claritin, methylprednisolone for the rash after seeing his family physician virtually and the family physician recommended he contact where he was vaccinated to report these symptoms.  I have reached out to the patient for additional information and he has declined, so I do not have any access to details on his positive covid test or records from that virtual encounter.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

Symptoms began approximately 24 hours after receiving the second vaccine, and gradually subsided over the following 24 hours, with only moderate diarrhea, heart palpitations, and fatigue remaining. It was by far the worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to a vaccine The only side effects after the first vaccine were moderate fatigue the evening of the vaccine and moderate arm pain.

                                                I developed a rash on the back of my right hand, which the documentation i was provided with at time of vaccination included rash as a severe allergic reaction.    I also developed chills that would hit me at random times of the day for a week.  These chills occurred every day for a week.

At 5:00 pm, I got out of work, I went straight home because I felt so weak and my eyes got watery (didn&#39;t go to work out afterward) and I got the chills and my bones started to hurt, I went to bed and slept all - my bones were in horrific pain - especially in my back. Saturday morning, I felt the same -I took OTC med for the pain - no fever; body aches, watery eyes and I was very weak. I drank orange juice and I took some Zinc; vitamin C - and I hurt all that day - bones still achy but not quite as much. Sunday morning, I wasn&#39;t normal but better and by Sunday noon I was better; not weak anymore. On a scale from one to 10, I felt like a ten when it was bad. My injection site was sore for a good four days. I took it on a Friday but Tuesday the arm was good to go.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

                                                Soreness around injection site (normal) for two days.  On Friday (two days after shot) noticed rash and some swelling about the size of three quarters at injection site.

                                                I definitely had a soreness at the injection site, more than I have had with any other shot. It definitely subsided after a couple of days. Also had joint pain in my hands, elbows, and knees, and particularly in my left knee where I have arthritis, also decreased in intensity within a few days of the shot.   About a week after the shot, my arm began to itch at the injection site, and swelling and a half-dollar sized red patch appeared, and the skin was hot to the touch. Today (2 days later), the red patch is roughly the size of a small envelope. The skin is still warm or hot to the touch and the swelling may have subsided slightly. I am not taking any antihistamines or using any topicals- just working on not scratching the area. I have read some info on the internet referring to this as &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. It is manageable, and I am NOT deterred from getting my second shot in April.

                                                Client received the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, he was escorted to the observation area. At the end of his 15-minute observation period, he reported hives on his left forearm. He denied pruritis or any other symptoms. His left forearm had about 10 small red raised hives, separated by an inch. He was directly observed by a nurse for an additional 15 minutes. In that time, the hives subsided nearly completely. The client was advised to closely monitor for any recurring or additional symptoms in the next 1-4 hours. The client was instructed to check in with his medical provider for discussion and further assessment of this mild reaction, in the context of his diagnosed allergy to dust, and determination if he should receive a 2nd dose. In the meantime, he has been added to the list for referral to a hospital for potential vaccination with a 2nd dose.

                                                1.  Woke up the day after receiving the first dose without the ability to taste anything.  I could smell soaps/mint/fragrant lotions etc, if I sniffed it up close, but I could not taste anything. I tested this with several different  types of food.  This lasted until about 12:30 pm that day.  When I ate lunch I could taste my food again.   This was a strange event for me. I have never lost my sense of taste before.  2.  The evening of the third day after receiving the first dose of the moderna COVID-19 vaccine I experienced an approximate 4 inch diameter redness and itching around the injection site on my left shoulder.  There was also an itchy rash that extended across my chest and back to my right shoulder.  I took an antihistamine and went to bed.  When I awoke the next day the rash extending across my chest, back, and right shoulder was gone.  However, my left shoulder still  itched for the rest of that day.  The itchiness was gone when I awoke the next day.

I was just itching all over.  About 11 days later is when I came down with something else. I was having body aches and diarrhea. I was seen in the ED. By Monday late evening I was starting to feel back to normal.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

                                                Started with itching on back and arms on Wednesday 2-10-21.  By Friday evening I had a rash all over my back and hives on my back and right arm.  Some hive are also apparent on my left hand and wrist.  I contacted my doctor Sunday 2-14-21 as the rash and itching were not being controlled by benadryl and hydroctorisone cream.  My doctor gave me Prednisone to take 60mg daily for 5 days.  I am now on day 2 of therapy and the rash on my back has gone down some, the rash on my right wrist and hand are still severe.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 31 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unspecified date, the patient experienced fever, chills, abdominal pain, anorexia/lack of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue/frequently had to lay in bed, and cellulitis on his left shin and foot. The patient took paracetamol and naproxen for the events, which somewhat helped.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, fever, chills, abdominal pain, anorexia/lack of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue/frequently had to lay in bed, were considered resolved on an unknown date. The outcome for the event, cellulitis on his left shin and foot, was reported as not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. Cellulitis of shin and foot is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                7pm on date of injection I got very sleepy and fell asleep.  I woke up at 12:45am sweating but chilled to the bone.  I felt feverish but was too cold to get out of bed.  When I actually got out of bed I had a very intense headache, and body aches.  I took my temp and it registered 104.  at 8am I took my dogs out but felt very old, chilled to the bone &amp;  lightheaded.  It was chilly outside.  I got back inside and got back into bed as fast as I could. The second I laid down, the sweat just poured out of my body, drenching my shirt, sheets, and blanket.  The fever lasted all day but was slowly improving throughout the day.  My arm was also incredibly sore at the injection site.  It was very sore for shot one too but the pain lasted nearly 2 weeks the first time and is already just about gone now.  Yesterday, or 2 days after dose 2 injection, the fever was gone.  I still had a headache, and body aches but also developed nausea.  I did not vomit but I did have diarrhea.  I also noticed extreme shortness of breath over very minor exertion.  I?m not sure if this was due to extreme dehydration , due to loss of fluids or if it?s associated with the vaccine.  My lungs feel clear and I deny ever suffering from a bronchial spasms..  Day 3 I?m feeling more myself but am still suffering from gastric upset.  Nausea has dissipated.

Subsided in a day and then a slight painful (like a sunburn feeing) point which seemed to be on a lymph node site near collar bone for a couple days. Then on the seventh day, redness and swelling on upper chest in same area. Got worse for two days then began to get better. Spot grew initially but then stopped growing. Slightly itchy, slightly painful, and very warm on second day.

                                                One month after my second dose I have started to have nerve pain in the immediate area around the injection site. This area had been pain free since about one week after the second shot.  As of now the pain is ongoing. It got worse for about 2 days and has remained the same since without improvement.  The pain is manageable and not bad enough that I feel need of medication. But I am concerned about it and wondering if others are reporting similar events, and if so, what is a common recovery timeline.

                                                I don&#39;t think that my reaction to the vaccine is super serious but it is perhaps worth noting if others are also experiencing similar symptoms. On the second day, I did have the expected arm soreness around the injection area on my right arm. That soreness faded by Saturday morning. However, on Saturday afternoon, I began experiencing some intermittent pain in my left kidney. I have had a few (3?) kidney stones since I was approximately 35 years old so it is a pain that I recognize almost immediately.  I kept my spider senses awake to see where it was going to go. About an hour later, I had intermittent &#34;flu like&#34; pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn&#39;t seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out. I cannot 100% say that any of these symptoms are related to the vaccine. However, being a Type 1 diabetic (since 1978) and the unusual kidney pain made me go, &#34;huh.&#34; That is why I am providing this info in the event that there are others who are experiencing similar symptoms that can be tied to the vaccine and what to expect. I feel completely fine now. Yay. :)

                                                I experienced insidous onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations after approximately 2-3 minutes of inoculation.  This episode lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I was not expecting this having no prior history of adverse response to vaccines.  I also felt a flushing sensation in my head.   My breathing felt slightly more difficult.  No sweating, throat closure or itching.   I did not measure pulse and instead tried to breathe/meditate to bring it down.  I estimate it was about 140 bpm .  Breathing/meditation brought it down but it was still elevated when the nurse checked me after 20 minutes.  I remained onsite an additional 15 minutes until I felt well enough to leave but my heart rate was still somewhat elevated, about 20 bpm higher than my usual.   My heart rate seemed to fluctuate throughout the evening and my sleep was subsequently very poor.  I feel much better this morning, just the usual arm soreness after a vaccination.  I have reached out to my primary doctor concerning whether she feels this event would warrant my not getting the second dose or perhaps having a prescribed epipen on my person.  Having no personal history but a family history of severe heart disease (father had first MI at age 42, second at 44 followed by triple bypass and CHF) this incident with my heart rate certainly raised some anxiety.  I had a routine EKG done in June which was normal, I am a physical therapist and in good health.  I am hoping to have the next vaccine in a proper medical facility.   I have read CDC recommendations to not have the second shot if certain adverse responses are experienced and I am not certain whether this would qualify.   I have no history of adverse reactions to vaccines.    Considering the role of anxiety versus the insidious and nearly immediate onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations and persistent elevated heart rate for more than 12 hours, I feel this event was primarily driven by the vaccine.

                                                Numbness in right side of head and right arm (where he received injection). Starting getting confused. Legs started to give out. Continued working. Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                Did not notice until  January 13th, but there is about a one to one and  half inch length strip by 1/2 inch wide  of discoloration running anterior to the injection side of my arm, where it is slightly discolored. I would almost call it slightly jaundiced in color to a slight bruising in color.  The area is not sore to the touch, nor warm nor itchy. I noticed it perhaps last week around January 13th, so it could have been there longer.  No need for medical care nor intervention. Thought it might be worth reporting.  I have had bruising before from a vaccine or blood draw, and this length of discoloration is too long to be bruising.  I do not bruise easily nor have any type of coagulation disorder.

At around 630 in the evening, I began to feel a sharp pain going down my left arm from middle of shoulder to the hand.  This especially happened when I raised my arm.  I kept my left arm down to side trying to slowly move it during the day.  I contact Hot line for Hospital and explained issues.  They described certain reasons but said that I could take Motrin.  I began taking Motrin every 4 hours.  The next day I was able to raise arm about half way. The pain became a dull and aching from shoulder to hand. I continue to take Motrin.

                                                My Left shoulder became red at the injection site and swollen.  I also have pain and stiffness going from the injection site all the way up to the base of my skull.  If I look down at my hands, my cell phone, the ground or even at a desk too long, the left side of my neck gets so stiff that it hurts to raise my head back up to normal height.  The muscles in my left shoulder and left side of my neck are so tight that it seems like I have been lifting weights for days.  I have not worked out in months.  Today is 1/23/21 and I still have the problem.   I also had a migraine headache for three to four days after the vaccine.

                                                I began with chills on Weds. morning around 10am that only got worse not matter what I did. My arm continued to hurt but I thought it was just the injection pain. I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit. Dr. feels this was and allergic reaction and recommends I do not get the second injection.

His wife noticed that he had discrete circular patches of hair missing from scalp as his wife is shorter she had not noticed before, until the 16th when he was going down the stairs in front of her. The spots are not puritic nor scaley consistent with other entities. Presentation is consistent with alopicia ereata though autoimmune can be brought on by immunization as has been demonstrated by the recombinant DNA Hep B immunization.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

By then next afternoon (Thursday) my arm was sore particularly at the injection sight at my left deltoid, with some diffuse soreness shoulder to elbow laterally.  By that same afternoon and evening I had chills and aches and started to feel run down.  That evening my temperature was slightly elevated around 99.3 degrees.  Some chills and aches, and feeling run down persisted the next morning (Friday) , I slept most of that morning and until 1::00 PM.  Mostly felt better by that evening and fine by the next day (Saturday).  The arms soreness also subsided by Saturday. As a side not with my first dose 4 weeks earlier my only symptom was soreness at the injection site for 3 days (more significant than I have experienced with other vaccines, including the flu vaccine.)

I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

                                                about 7 to 10 days after Moderna shot, started to notice some petechia spots around both feet and working up legs. 10 days after spots started to developed on both forearms. Went to clinic and they did lab work-up to include PT/INR. CBC, BMP etc. all labs normal. Spots continued to grow with some starting to look like large healing bruising, nut never went away. Received second moderna shot on 2/2/21 and about 5 to 7 days after shot noticed an increase in blotchy spots to both legs and arms. I then had a visit with Dr. who ordered steroid cream, which had no effect on areas and was given referral to a dermatologist.   Spots then started to run from wrist on both arms up to biceps and from feet on both legs up to mid-thigh. I then start to have spots start on abdomen and in groin area. With some spots looking to irregular ringworm type marks. Dermatologist appointment was cancelled due to weather.

It doesn&#39;t burn as much today but is still puffy and red. I think the vaccine supercharged (for lack of a better word) the dermatitis.

Around Feb 12, I had some pain in my left nostril and over the course of a week or so it swelled and became very red and painful. I contacted my doctor by phone on Feb 19 and she prescribed Kephlex, Feb 20 I went to Urgent Care and they said I had cellulitis on my nose. They prescribed Augmentin and took a culture. Feb 21, I went to the Emergency because it was not getting any better, they prescribed Bactrim and sent me home. I missed two days of work and felt miserable for over a week. My nose still hurts today.

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

                                                About 15 minutes after my shot, I began to experience symptoms of an allergic reaction, similar to when I accidentally eat tree nuts. There was a tightness in my chest and a tingling of my lips. I brought this to the pharamacists&#39; attention, and they gave me Benadryl and had me wait at the pharmacy, after making me promise to let them know if things got worse. In the next 15 minutes or so, I experienced additional allergic reaction symptoms, including swelling of the tongue and an itchy rash (although these were relatively minor). About an hour after I got the shot, I felt well enough to drive hom.

                                                I experienced &#34;Moderna Arm&#34; on the day following the injection, but it subsided after a couple of days. Eight days later, though, it returned (swelling/redness/milder pain) -- accompanied by swelling in my right ankle and tightness/some tingling/mild pain in my right ankle/upper calf. I suffered a blood clot for the first time in each leg in early November; the more serious of the two was in the vicinity of my upper calf in my right leg. In December, I began to experience sensations in my right ankle that were similar (albeit more intense) to what I later experienced after my vaccine; the post-vaccination symptom in my right calf was also similar (but milder) to what I had experienced from the DVT.

This spread to involve pain throughout the posterior upper arm for about 6 days before resolving. Did get moderate relief with use of ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q 8 hrs PRN. Received vaccine on 12/23/20 at 6pm.  Woke up at 5am to go to work on 12/24/20 and felt flu-like symptoms with subjective fever (did not measure), joint pain, and diffuse myalgias.  Symptoms progressed over the next three hours and culminated in about half an hour of significant rigors with uncontrolled shivering.  Ibuprofen dose of 600mg orally did help symptoms enough to allow me to finish my shift but I needed two more doses every 8 hours before symptoms resolved in 24 hrs.

Was not immediately noticeable and seemed to be more pronounced about 1/2 hour after injection.  I had the other expected soreness at injection site and general malaise approximately 24 hours after  - 96 hours after vaccine and I am only reporting this as I was not expecting the numbness in the tongue and was not sure if it was an adverse effect or just stress related.

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

                                                approximately 12 hours after vaccine administration, I became cold with bone rattling and teeth chattering chills with severe shivering.  I had no fever when I checked my temperature orally.  I developed 3 small urticaria with one on my abdomen and one on each thigh.    I treated with 50mg of benadryl and 800 mg of Motrin.  It appeared to be a euthermic cytokine storm to me ( I am an ICU physician).   The symptoms resolved without issue.

                                                Vaccine received on Friday afternoon. On Saturday night I noticed a slight rash on my back, same side as shot. Sunday the rash go worse. On Monday it was bigger and blotchy and my chest, although no rash, felt like I had a sunburn. At this point I filled out the CDC online form and submitted symptoms. I&#39;ve filled out daily health check each day, but didn&#39;t hear back from anyone. On Tuesday it was worse and I had a small rash/blotches on my left chest. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and benedryl.  It was the same, maybe el ghtly worse on Wednesday so I made an appointment with my primary care doctor. I saw my doctor today, Thursday, February 18th and was told I have shingles. The nurse practitioner said I was the 3rd person this week that came in with shingles. Should I still get the 2nd vaccine dose? I was given a prescription, which I haven&#39;t picked up yet, so I couldn&#39;t list what it is.

Day 2: Next morning was difficult getting out of bed. Skin was very sensitive to warm/hot shower water. Achy joints all over. Even my left injection site was sore even though I was injected on the right side. Fatigue at work. I was very wide eyed as described by co-worker. I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed. Day 3: When I awoke I felt like a fever had broke, Cooling sweat, but my temp was never over 98.5 degrees. My normal morning temp is usually 97.3 every day, but that one degree made a difference. I feel normal today and realize I was not well the day before.

I took a single Claritin and had relief within a few hours. The next day the itchiness returned and I took another single Claritin pill.  The hives went down and there was redness but the itchiness subsided.  I took a Claritin on the third day and had no other issues.  The rash and hives stayed localized only to the tops of my feet.  Important to note I did not use any different soap or detergent or have my feet exposed to any plants or vegetation.  I continued wearing cotton socks and slides as I had been doing all along.  I reported it to my doctor?s office who suggested I report it to the facility I received the shot from.  They referred me to report it here.

By the following morning, I felt that skin area, as well as the area around both of my eyes to feel as if I had sustained second degree burns. Additionally, the skin around my eyes particularly, presented with extreme dryness and geriatric symptoms, such as wrinkling and streched thinned skin, as if I were an elderly person (over 75 years old, and not 52).  The flaring/burning subsided after 4-5 days. However, the skin dryness around the eyes has persisted to this day (i.e. 5 weeks past the 1st vaccination). A day after the 2nd part of the vaccination, I felt moderate dizziness and headache, which lasted for about 24 hours. Also, light soreness and skin stiffening were experienced at the arm location where the shot was adminmistered.

                                                No reaction to first shot. Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

                                                Delayed side effect: developed red patch/rash at the site of injection on the left arm on 03/19/21 evening. The pinkish color patch was tender and a bit swollen with mild itch and also mild pain. This condition remained until 03/22/21. Today is 03/23/21 and this delayed side effect seem to be diminishing but not completely gone. I applied over the counter Cortizone cream last night to the rash area that may have helped diminish the reaction.

                                                I received my 1st COVID vaccine on 1/9/2021. On 1/17/2021 I woke with the injection site swollen and red and hard to the touch. Throughout the day, the swelling and redness reduced somewhat, but the area spread. The site was hot (99 degrees) compared to the surrounding area (96.5 degrees). The red area is now on much of my tricep.  It is not painful. If anything it is somewhat numb.

As of Wednesday , 1/20/21, three days after receiving the vaccine, I noticed small bumps on both ankles, palms of both hands, and left forearm.

                                                On 1/20/21 I received the vaccination. The next day I felt achy but not in distress.  On Saturday 1/23/21 I woke up with hives on my left arm and chest and a swelling on my left eye.  I took benadryl which had no effect. The next day the hives had progressed to blisters, my hand swelled  and my eye had almost swollen shut.  I contacted my health care advisers and they prescribed predinosne.  This reversed the reaction and the wounds are healing.  I have pictures of how I looked.

                                                I had a really bad day after the second dose. Horrible migraine headache that built as the day moved on.  As a rule, I do not get migraines and whenever I have gotten a headache I&#39;ve not had a  sensitivity to light or sound, like I did yesterday.  It was just miserable. Lots of body ache and a generalized feeling of sickness, similar to influenza or food poisoning.  I had no energy.   My arm at the injection site hurt constantly without even being touched all day and I could not sleep on my left side due to arm pain around the injection site. The arm pain from the injection site, occasionally radiated to my elbow joint , depending on how I moved my arm.  It is still sensitive today, two days later, and has a sensitive swelling in the area where the injection occurred. I do not feel bad today, but I do feel like I am 100% yet, either, but I feel a LOT better than I did yesterday.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

                                                On January 8, 2021, I felt bumps on the right side of my back.  They appeared to be shingles.  After discussing my symptoms with Dr. , he prescribed a course of valacyclovir.  I took this for 1 week.  The blisters, redness, and pain in my back/torso improved over time.  They lesions are now completely gone.

Left arm at injection site sore.  Details:  approximately 1 am I woke up with chills, headache, earache and tiredness.    I took Tylenol and this continued waking up again a few hours later the same.   Eventually I felt very hot.   Upon waking again tired/fatigue, headache, earache.   At approximately 11:30 am I got out of bed,  shaky &amp; very tired.   I eventually felt better, just tired.   (With exception of Arm still hurting).    Please note I had Covid in December and had similar symptoms, except these all hit me at the same time and felt much worse then when I had Covid.

The rash was pink, slightly inflamed, and was slightly feverish.  I had mild itching associated with the rash.  The rash lasted approximately 48 hours.  I would categorize the symptoms as mild.  The fact that they appeared 6 days after the vaccination was administered was interesting to me.

The next day (DEC 30th) I continued with a mild headache and the injection site pain had increased. By 1800 hrs on the 30th while at work I began not to feel well. Body aches all over along with headache. When I arrived home that night around 2300 hrs I was feeling flushed and the body aches had increased. I took my temperature several times that night with different thermometers to make sure I was getting accurate temp readings. My average temps consisted of 99.8. I did take iburofen that night. The following morning my temp was normal and the body aches had subsided. I continued to have a headache that day being DEC 31st. To note: I never had any prior symptoms, nor ever being covid positive to my knowledge. I had two prior surgeries, first procedure on NOV 4 and another procedure on DEC 9 of 2020. I was tested for Covid prior to both procedures which were negative results.

The day after vaccine shot, my right testes was achey and sore (and still is uncomfortable) Also, the top side of my right foot was very tender. During the course of the week, that part of my foot became lightly swollen as did the front of my right leg, up to the top of the shin bone. Today?s date: 1/22/21 5:19 pm and leg and foot still tender and slightly swollen.

                                                I developed a rash consisting of many itchy red spots and patches on my front torso (upper chest to top of groin area) and some  similar but fewer spots on my back, arms, legs,  and neck.  My scalp is also itchy.  Rash began as one red spot  in the center of my chest near the breast bone and other spots began to appear.  I noticed the first spot on 1-11 or 1-12; I&#39;m not sure of the exact date.    I scheduled an appointment with my primary care provider for 1-22 at 11:00.  He examined  me and recommended I start a course of OTC antihistamines and topical  cream (Triamcinolone Acetonide .1%) for two weeks.  The rash is a bit less itchy since starting treatment two days ago, but it is still visible and present.  The itchiness woke me from my sleep last night and the night before.

                                                After the vaccination  on 1/18/2021 , I had just pain at the site of injection in my left arm for the next 2   to 3 days  and headache.  Took Advil and it went away. After 3 or 4 days i started feeling very mild pain inside my arm muscles between  the injection site and my elbow  which continued till 1/25/2021.   Later this  very mild internal pain shifted  to my elbow  and   feel a mild numbing sensation in my pinky finger.  It also feels little heavy when I move my arm.  This  continues till  today as I am reporting on 1/30/2021 3:30pm.  Since it has not bothered much , I did not seek medical care, hoping this will  go away in few weeks.

                                                Went to my doctor thinking it was a very very bad sinus infection. My doctor didn&#39;t think it was with the way my headaches were. It hurt on the back right and above the right ear. It hurt to touch. My tongue is not functjioning now.  I had to get a MRI because they thought it could of been a mini stroke. MRI came back negative the doctors told me Bell Palsy.  They advise me not to get my second dose on 2/3/21.

                                                I received first Moderna vaccine shot (Lot # 011L20A) on Jan 6, 2021 and received second Moderna vaccine shot (031L20A) on Feb 3, 2021 at approx. 2:15pm Approximately 36 hours later, at 2am last night while sleeping, the left side of mouth (upper &amp; lower lips) swelled up for unknown reason(s).   I ate dinner at approx. 6pm, and had salad, steak and green beans, all of which I have eaten before without any side effects I don&#39;t believe it is a food allergy and I have not experience any trauma to my lips or face.  At approximately 5:30am, I took 2 Benadryl, in an attempt to reduce swelling.  As of 8am, the swelling is still evident.  Other than swollen lips, only other reaction to shot is minor soreness by the injection site in my left arm.  I am not sure if there is a correlation between the vaccine and my swollen lips, but I&#39;ve never had swollen lips before. Only other reason, for the swelling,  I could think of would by possible spider bite but I feel that is unlikely. If swelling persists, I will contact my doctor.

                                                At 5 days post vaccination, patient developed severe left shoulder pain, originally thought to be secondary to chronic shoulder pain and a recent fall, over the next three days it progressed to swelling, severe pain, and limited ROM. He ended up being admitted to the hospital and CT scan showed development of significant soft tissue infiltration around sternum and sternoclavicular joints. This was originally thought to be infectious, but he never developed a fever or leukocytosis and we feel this was most likely an inflammatory process. I have no idea if this was actually a vaccine side effect, but given the proximity in both time a location and the known complication of shoulder pain with the vaccine, it seems reasonable to give you the information to monitor for other similar cases.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.    Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 12-Feb-2021, approximately 2 days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    The patient received his vaccine on 12-Feb-2021 and reported that his arm hurt a little for a few days. On 14-Feb2021, he reported that he started feeling sluggish and on 20-Feb-2021 he began to have difficulty breathing and pain in the right lower base of rib cage. He went to urgent care where he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism for which he received treatment. On the evening of the same day, he again started having difficulty breathing with pain upon inhalation. He returned to urgent care and was subsequently admitted at 12:30 AM on 21-Feb-2021. That  Monday, 22-Feb-2021, a doppler ultrasound revealed a deep vein thrombosis in the left calf. Patient was treated with heparin intravenously (IV). He was discharged 22-Feb-2021.    Treatment for the event included Xarelto 20mg twice per day for two weeks and Heparin IV.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and dyspnea, was considered recovering/resolving as of discharge on 22-Feb-2021.  The outcome of the events, vaccination site pain and sluggishness, were considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It got progressively worse. By about hour 17 I was beginning to get cold sweats and stomach bothering me more. By hour 18 I was cold, sweating, nauseous, vomiting, hard tight pain in stomach /and sternum/chest.  Stomach / chest pain persisted badly for about 30- 45 minutes then began to subside.  By hour 19 most of the sever pain subsided.  for the rest of the day (@and still 25 hours later) I still have a lingering miserable stomach and slight headache.  I slept most of the afternoon without any medication.

About eleven hours after shot I had headache, feeling of irregular body temperature, nausea, body aches..  I took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea which helped.    About 24 hours after the injection I experienced sore armpit/lymph nodes of shot arm.   All but the symptoms except the sore armpit/lymph nodes  were mostly gone within 30 hours of the shot.  The lymph nodes felt better a day or two later.

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)

Patient slept for a few hours then woke up for lunch. Around 12:30-1:00 the patient exhibited three episodes of syncope. Emergency services was called after the first. Firefighters couldn&#39;t find BP, was in 70s by doppler only. Patient taken to hospital for care.    Discharged from ED around 5, suspecting hypotension 2/2 to diphenhydramine use. Monitored vitals at home; became severely hypotensive (BP 70s/40s both with automatic monitor and manual read) and lethargic again about an hour or so after, but normotensive again right before about to call ambulance. Pt claimed to be okay and had some dinner. Fourth episode of syncope, ambulance was called.         Patient remains at hospital ED since, still in observation unit. BP&#39;s normalized but itching returns periodically. IV steroids and diphenhydramine. Took head CT yesterday; no word on the results. Stable and alert enough since yesterday to communicate with us with his phone. Patient is scheduled for an echo to be done today.    No hx of severe allergic reaction. Treated for active TB 30 years ago, shingles x2 in the past few years; otherwise healthy 55 y/o male.     Pt discharged 01/04 to home with fatigue and malaise.

Pushing on that area you could tell it was much harder than areas around it. I am using benadryl cream. First day reporting. Hope it clears up.

I took a benedryl at 5:00pm on Wednesday 3/03/2021. Called my family doctor on Thursday morning and he told me to take 1 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 at night to help clear the rash. My Doctor said it was not anaphylaxis as it did not happen immediately after the vaccine but 24 hours later. I have no trouble breathing as I check myself with oximeter and my oxygen level is 97%.  I did have Covid on January 3, 2021 and after the vaccine on 03/02/2021 I experienced nausea, chills and a dull headache and then the rash. I have experienced this type of rash before after a stomach virus and it lasts for 3 or 4 days and clears up.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Co-suspect product included non-company product ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) for Plaque psoriasis.    No Medical History information was reported.   On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form On an unknown date, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. and ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) (Subcutaneous) dosage form. On 15-Dec-2020, the patient experienced HIP ARTHROPLASTY (hip replacement) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced RASH (neck rash). At the time of the report, HIP ARTHROPLASTY (hip replacement) had resolved and RASH (neck rash) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No relevant concomitant medications were reported  No treatment information was provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   there is no reasonable possibility that the events of hip replacement surgery, after First dose of covid vaccine developed rash around neck and after second dose of covid vaccine patient was fatigue are related to humira (adalimumab); Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

This spontaneous case was reported by a physician and describes the occurrence of HIP ARTHROPLASTY (hip replacement) in a 55-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Co-suspect product included non-company product ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) for Plaque psoriasis.

                                                Around day 7 or 8 I noticed a slight itch and redness at the injection site. I had significant pain for 48 hours but that has subsided and resolved 95% . But the redness is lingering.

The rash is raised, slightly itchy, and measure 8 cm in length, and 6 cm wide. No other signs or symptoms - I was just surprised at the reaction a week after the shot so I thought I should report it.

                                                Approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine shot, I experienced sudden dizziness and nausea for approximately 1 minute. Also, my entire left arm looked a bit red, but no hives. It went away as quickly as it occurred. Approximately 30 minutes after that, I experienced nausea again( which was a bit more intense). It also lasted for approximately 1 minute then it quickly ceased. At 4pm (5 hours after the shot), I got a severe headache. I&#39;m not sure if that was related to the vaccine. I took acetaminophen and slept soundly through the night. The next day, I felt fine, and I have felt fine since.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included metoprolol, fish oil, vitamin B, vitamin D3, zinc, vitamin C, turmeric, sertraline, and encapsulated dried fruits and vegetables.   On 28 Dec 2020 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 19 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient experienced sore left deltoid, swelling of the lymph nodes on the same side, and tender axilla. On 19 Jan 2021, the patient experienced very slight tender to touch in the pectoral area and second dose of vaccine given 22 days after first dose. No treatment information was provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome of the events, experienced sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, and tender axilla was considered resolved on 30 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, slight tender to touch in the pectoral area and second dose vaccine given 22 days apart, was considered resolved on 19 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of a 56-year-old male patient who experienced second dose vaccine administered 22 days apart (Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered) and non-serious events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla, tender to touch in the pectoral area after the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot # 012L20A., expiration date-unknown).  The events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla occurred the same day after administration of the first dose of the vaccine and event of tender to touch in the pectoral area occurred on the same day after the last dose and 22 days after the first dose.  No treatment was reported, and outcome is resolved for the event of slight tender to touch in the pectoral area. The reported events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla, tender to touch in the pectoral area are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine. Hence, based on the information provided a causal association between the administration of mRNA-1273 and the reported events cannot be excluded The event of second dose vaccine administered 22 days apart is considered not applicable.

Next morning quite achy, strong headache, light sensitive. No breathing or cognition issues. Not eating but no g.i. issues. Injection site is sore.  Mostly recovered or anyway not worried about lingering symptoms at 20 hours past shot (if something gets worse I&#39;ll report again). My goal in submitting this report was only to describe  what I consider to be note-worthy side effects. By comparison, I had a first covid  vaccine dose exactly 1 month ago and no real signs. Also, I had covid-19 infection, moderately sick, in March 2020 (tested pos for covid antibodies in May 2020.

                                                A severe, dull ache resulted at the vaccination site yesterday several hours after vaccination and radiated down my are, up my neck, and down my back. 1000MG of Tylenal helped, but the ache remains. The arm is swollen, warm to the touch, and black and blue. Today I have a mild fever, some hot flashes, nausea without vomiting, body weakness, and overall muscle aching. This is the sickest I&#39;ve been in years.

                                                About a day later I noticed some itching in the back of neck and over the course of a few more days, it got worse and I started to see red welts developing on my neck, left shoulder, and left upper side of chest and back.  It was very itchy and starting to get more painful.  Then 10 days later some of the welts turned to scabs while new welts were developing.  Much more pain.  Also, I left shoulder started to increase with pain and was loosing range of motion.    About 5 days into the first shot, I spoke to my primary doctor and originally he said just a reaction to vaccine, use Alegra and that should  take care of it.  I contacted him 10 days into the vaccine and sent him pictures of the welts and he said it&#39;s very clear I have the shingles.  While he didn&#39;t say the shingles were related to the vaccine, the timing is very suspicious.  I truly believe something happened with the vaccine that caused this.

Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation and had a pacemaker placed about 8-9 months ago.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event were blood pressure medication, antiarrhythmics.  On 01 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030m20a) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01 Mar 2021, after vaccination, the patient developed red dots on both of his arms. For next two days, the patient had rash on both arms, was dizzy, felt sick, developed fast heart rate; went to hospital twice for heart rate either 07 Mar 2021 or 13 Mar 2021.During first visit to hospital, fast rate was brought under control, while in the second visit, the patient had a procedure in which his heart was cut from top to bottom and was made pacemaker dependent. The atrial fibrillation could not be controlled for 26 hours and had a flutter which was not identified and could not be controlled. Flutter returned after stopping amlodipine and hence patient was restarted on amlodipine. The patient now feels very weak, has a hard time walking, has no energy, cannot do the simplest of tasks, still experiences fast heart rate and flutter every now and then.   No Laboratory investigations were provided. The Treatment information included pacemaker, amlodipine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cardiac pacemaker dependent, atrial fibrillation, red dots on both of his arms, rash on both arms, dizziness, sick, atrial flutter, very weak and no energy, hard time walking, cannot do the simplest of tasks were unknown.

                                                4 days after receiving my vaccine I experienced a painful sore throat.    Examination of my oropharynx reveals a solitary 1mm pustule  with surrounding erythema on the posteriolateral edge of the hard palate.  I have not experienced any fever or URI symptoms.  It is on the same side as my vaccine.  I am not sure if it is relevant but I reached out to my Infectious Disease colleague and he recommended I report this to you ( I am a Dermatologist). The lesion is still present today 36 hours later without any new lesions or progression.  I do not have any history of herpes or aphthous ulcers and have never had a lesion on this part of my hard palate before.

I wonder if people who have had the virus should be being told to get the vaccine since I suspect intense reaction is due to pre existing immunity.

My heart began racing to about one and one half the normal to a rate of 100, at about 30 hours after the injection.  It then slowed to 50 bpm for about 15 minutes before racing back to 100 and becoming somewhat irregular, slow pace followed by several quick beats then a beat or two slow again and then several quick beats.  This lasted for a few hours and then I fell asleep.  When I woke up about 7 hours later, it was back to normal.  Some slight body ache and headache.

The next day, he began to have what appeared to be petechial hemorrhaging in his abdomen. By Sunday, the hemorrhaging had spread from his neck to his knees.  On Monday, he saw his primary care physician, who sent him to hospital ER. After performing extensive tests, the ER doctor stated that the test results were normal, and he could find no reason for most of his body being purple. By Tuesday, he was returning to normal.  The abdominal pain was gone by Tuesday as well.

It looks like bee stings bigger then a quarter 3 on my stomach and 3 on back. Lots of little bumps. It hurts very sensitive. I felt like my ribs and kidney were hurting but it is because of the nerves when I touch them.  This is been about a week. I am going to call my doctor. The pain is not just one spot but the whole area around them.

                                                blood sugar levels began to be about 20% higher than normal within about 24 to 48 hours after the injection and have stayed that way for over two weeks.  No other symptoms have been experienced aside from soreness at the injection site for less than 8 hours after the shot.

It might be 20A at the end and not 2OA with the letter O.  As for the adverse event, after 24 hours had a bit a sore arm, some redness and hardness in the area of the injection.  Seemed to go away in a day or so for the most part then I forgot about it until last night, 2-22-21 (eight days after injection) when I noticed rather large oval-shaped red mark about the size of an egg.  Slightly elevated but not bad.  No pain.  A little itchy but not bad.  So I googled it quickly today and I find out that it&#39;s not all that uncommon and likely more common than you realize because most guys aren&#39;t going to take the time to report something like this, in my opinion.   I see that some of the health care workers are being quoted as saying it&#39;s probably either an allergic reaction to a vaccine ingredient or an immune system reaction.  In my opinion it&#39;s the latter, at least with respect to me as several years ago after being bitten by a honeybee in palm of hand in fat part near thumb a similar thing happened.where it hurt and was red for a day or two or three and then seemed to recede but then came back with a red mark bigger than before, but it didn&#39;t hurt much, more of an itch if I recall correctly.  So for some reason that&#39;s apparently how my immune system fights off something foreign.  I have type A blood I believe, if that matters.  I think I have a pretty good strong immune system for my age, as well.  Hopefully the second shot will not produce that much more of a reaction because of this or how I&#39;m reacting now to the first shot.  No big deal just a lot of unknowns.  I&#39;ll follow the news on this in the next couple weeks and report back if anything develops further.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Woke up at 11:15 pm with severe shivering, and was extremely cold. My temperature was 98.6. Turned my heat up to 74, added blankets to my bed, could not get warm. Finally had to add a large heat pack to my bed to alleviate shivering. My left shoulder and arm hurt. Abnormally bad sleep. Woke up this morning at 9:30am and am lethargic and very tired. I feel like I was hit by a truck.

Just about recovered, probably will feel completely well by tomorrow.

Most intense issues were Tuesday 24 hours post shot when I had more intense headaches and body aches.  SOB remained the same.  Tuesday evening, 35 hours post shot, I had chills and low grade fever 99.3.  Slept for 10 hours and fever was gone and hasn&#39;t returned.  Intensity of arm pain is diminished but still quite sore at actual injection site.  Headaches are not as intense as Tuesday but continue to fluctuate in intensity as they have for the past 3 months.

                                                My left upper arm became itchy yesterday (14 days  after getting the vaccine).  The itch seemed to come from within or under the top layer of skin.  It was distinctly noticeable but not severe. The area was mildly itchy the entire evening. It was less itchy today (almost 24 hours later) - almost gone.  Around the injection site, there is a about a 2.5 inch circle where the skin is light pink (I am a white person). It seemed a little bumpy last night, but the skin is smooth to the touch now.

I began to notice small red dots to the front of my lower extremities. As each day followed the red dots became larger and have progressed to the calfs, and behind my tricep area. They do not hurt but occasionally itchy. I am applying Cortizone cream to the areas affected.         To your knowledge, has this rash been reported by anyone post vaccination?Should I be concern? Is it safe to take the second dosage? I am schedule to receive it February 18.

Around 6 PM that day, I started feeling fatigued and my body felt achy.  I felt like my breath and body were warm, as though I had a fever, but my temperature was normal.  Drinking a lot of water did not help the feeling go away.  On the second morning following the vaccination (about 42 hours after the injection), I felt fine, but around 6 PM (52 hours after the injection), I felt tired again but not achy.  On the third morning, the only symptom that I felt was very mild tenderness near the injection site.

After 45 minutes the redness abated and I came home,    1 March 2021 I came down with COVID symptoms with dizziness, blurry vision, redness, ringing in the ear and flu like symptoms of body aches.   Then the neuralgia in the dextral ulnar nerve increased and clawing started.  Then same happened on the sinistral ulnar nerve and Carpal tunnel in the other finders.  I feared going to sleep for fear of awaking with paralysis.  I drank vodka to calm myself down and Xanax to sleep (I know it is a dangerous combination).  2 March the red skin continues and when I awoke at 13:30 today I was still extreme and I called 911.  The EMS visited and determined my blood pressure and pulse were normal.  The dextral  ulnar nerve problems continue,

After 36 hours, a very obvious and bad rash on hands that doctor diagnosed as dyshidrotic eczema.  Simultaneously legs were badly marked with dark red dots, especially lower legs, and much overall light red skin over upper legs and torso below neck.  The hands resolved over a few days with steroid cream.  The rest of the body continues, a month later, to feel like a sunburn.  The worst of the look of dark red dots on lower leg diminished over the first couple of weeks.  But even now, it feels like my skin is mildly burned.  I can even press it and release and see white where I pressed, surrounded by red, just like a sunburn.  Overall the skin looks mildly red, but nothing outrageous.
