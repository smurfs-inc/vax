This has led to some discomfort and unusual amount of pain that has him attempting to be seen by his primary provider.  He has been urged to seek attention from an urgent care facility, but his response was, &#34;I don&#39;t want to be a wimp about this, I&#39;ll hold out until I can see my primary doctor.&#34; This started almost immediately after his second dose.  He received the first dose in the other arm 4 weeks prior without any reaction at all.

                                                Patient had started peritoneal dialysis at home with me, his wife, 8 days before the second shot. All was going well. We got his second shot on the morig of March 18.  His only reaction seemed to be soreness at injection site. At 11 pm we started dialysis as usual, with the cycler.  At 12 pm he was having trouble breathing after just having been filled with 1500 ml of dialysate. This was the first time this happened. I gave hi nitro glycerine and had the cycler take out the 1500 ml of dialysate, and stopped the therapy for the night. He then felt better, and apologized for waking me up. In the morning he was dead.  I believe it is possible that the vaccine tipped the balance of patients already taxed system. As I know that people who have serious diseases and are older are encouraged to take the vaccine, this outcome should be known to the CDC.

The doctor gave me an injection (don&#39;t remember name) and prescribed Valtrex and Pepcid. The medication did not help resolve the shingles and it got worse. I went to the hospital 4/6/2021 and I was admitted to the hospital for 7 days.  I was admitted because I was dehydrated and had an allergic reaction to the shot the dermatologist gave me. I also pneumonia and septic.  They ran every test they could run and gave me antibiotics for the pneumonia and infection. I was discharged to follow up PCP.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included pulmonary fibrosis, sleep apnea, acid reflux and prostatitis. Concomitant medications reported included aciphex and ativan.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately two weeks prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, the patient experienced immediate flushing with red hot ears which persisted throughout the day and mild soreness at the injection site lasting approximately 24 to 48 hours. He experienced two instances of right-sided cramping neck pain accompanied by shoulder pain radiating to the head, lasting 5 to 10 minutes per episode between 20 Jan 2021 and 04 Feb2 021. These episodes were brief and have not returned and awaking to both legs and his back &#34;filled with pains&#34; on 23 Jan 2021. The leg pains subsided upon standing; back pain lasted all day 23 Jan2 021. The patient felt normal from 24 Jan 2021 until 04 Feb 2021.   On 04 Feb 2021, the patient&#39;s whole body became ice cold at approximately 3PM. By 3:15PM he was experiencing chills and shivering that lasted approximately one hour. Patient called his physician, and was directed to the Emergency Room (ER) immediately. There he received blood tests and prophylactic broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy immediately upon admission. Patient reports that Infectious Disease confirmed there were two strains of bacteria present in his bloodstream. From the patient additional samples were collected for culture to tailor antimicrobial therapy accordingly. He also said he was hospitalized for six days and discharged on 10 Feb 2021 with at home Iintravenous (IV) infusion device to administer continuous (24 hour) antibiotic therapy for a full 14 days. He was released from the hospital to his daughter&#39;s care.  He had no history of significant adverse events or allergic reactions post vaccine administration. He is concerned about the origin of the infection, as no source could be confirmed per Infectious Disease. The patient is concerned the infection could have stemmed from the vaccine or it&#39;s administration. He attests that his physician wants him to proceed with his second dose of Moderna.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events is unknown.   The events, flushing with red hot ears, mild soreness at the injection site, right-sided cramping neck pain accompanied by shoulder pain radiating to the head, leg pain, back pain, body became ice cold, chills and shivering were considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On 4/13/21, (9days later) he woke up in  the morning to find a rash/hives over his upper torso.  It   itched and in the following days spread over his complete torso, arms, back and lower torso. ,We now see a few on his legs and face, also and his body looks like I have painted his body and it covers all areas.  We have checked with His Dermatologist, his Internist and nurse who have noted this response to the second dose and suggested Zyrtec and Calimine lotion  for the itching.  At this time he still has the rash over all of his body.  I can send a picture if you like.  I would say this is a severe reaction for a 2nd shot.

                                                Date and time adverse event started: Patient stated he started to experience symptoms about 1.5 weeks after the 1st vaccine.   he started to notice red blisters on his legs that proceeded to arms and fingers and on his head. He felt itchy (still itchy but not as much). He stated he went to his PCP and they referred him to a dermatologist (seen about 3 weeks ago). He was prescribed Triamcinolone Ointment by the dermatologist and stated it&#39;s helping and blisters are subsiding. The PCP didn&#39;t prescribe anything. About 2 weeks ago he stated he started to feel neck pain (about 4 weeks after the 2nd shot). Patient has no c/o headache,fever or chills.  pt received dose 2 on 3/1/2021.   I advised the neck pain wasn&#39;t related to the vaccine but recommended to continue with the Triamcinolone ointment and he can also apply cortisone-10 cream/ointment to the help with itchiness or benadryl. He stated that the blisters have been getting better but he feels the problem is internally and he feels he needs to see the dermatologist again on 4/20/21.  4/21-onset 2 weeks after vaccine dose 1 --moderna on 1/28/21; 8.5 weeks of symptoms; feeling better but symptoms still present. Dermatologist said not vaccine related; using topical steroids. Saw PMD - to check blood work; told internal allergy.  Will call next week for follow up.
