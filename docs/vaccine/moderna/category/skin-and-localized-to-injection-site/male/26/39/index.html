                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

                                                Received the first dose 12:30pm Thursday(2/11). Around 6pm that same night I notice the first symptom. I had a super strong headache that lasted the next 24 hours or so. Still lingering now but not as bad. Around 3am Friday (2/12) I woke up with chills and the inject spot was extremely tender. All day Friday I had signs of a fever. Chills and felt cold but body was hot to the touch. This lasted all day and it kept Me in bed the whole day.  Around 6pm Friday night, my injection spot was extremely sore , and there was a red circle, about the size of a gold ball around the spot. That?s also when I  noticed I had shortness of breath and was having a little difficulty breathing. Around 8pm I noticed I had really high anxiety that was abnormal. It went away in about 30 mins or so. I thought it was strange as I normally don?t have anxiety that bad. I went to sleep around 10pm and woke up at 5am itchy with a red rash/hives on the upper half of my body, mostly the neck and chest area. Also the red circle around the injection site grew to the size of a baseball. The headache is still there but not as bad . Maybe 2/10 Severeness. I feel better in terms of the fever and breathing today (2/13).  However the rash/hives has gotten worse and seems to be spreading slowly. I plan on taking Benadryl when I grab it from the store in 30 mins or so

                                                I received my first Moderna shot on March 24th. Just had a sore arm the next day.   April 2nd: Around 1pm at work I was starting to feel a headache coming on. By about 2-3pm it was worse and felt tired/drowsy. I ate supper then went to take a nap at 7:30pm. I woke up at about 10:30pm, checked the time and just felt out of it so I went right back to sleep.  April 3rd: I slept until my dog woke me at about 5:50am and felt pretty good, still minor headache and some chills. During the night I did feel some soreness in my arm that got the covid shot. After I showered I checked my arm and it was swelled up with a rash like redness maybe an inch in diameter. I was fine for most of the day enjoying the nice weather outside. Then about 6pm I started to feel the headache again and some chills. Went to bed at about 10:30pm, headache was bad, had the chills, started coughing some, and just didn?t feel normal, took some Tylenol to help through the night.  April 4th: Slept through the night fine, woke up with a mild headache and a sore throat. Had some dry coughs occasionally throughout the day, but was fine most of the day.  I did check my temperature throughout these past few days and all check were normal.  April 5th: Almost back to normal, still have a sore throat and cough. My arm rash near the shot area has gone away, just a little swollen.  April 6th: Back to normal health.

                                                When the individual returned to the pharmacy on 5/19/21 he reported that he had a numb arm from the elbow bend to the shoulder starting the morning after the injection. He went to work and was unable to move his arm and had to leave work early and took the next day off as well. He said this continued for three days after the vaccine. He reported that he did contact his physician who told him to give it some time and if it  got worse to make an appointment to be seen, stating that all they would do is give him an anti-inflammatory to reduce swelling. The patient told the physician that he already had some for another condition and would just use that and did not go in to see her. He said that it was still not 100% on 5/19/21 but wanted to proceed with the shot in the same arm.  He was able to make circles with his arms over his head after the immunization was given a little lower that where the first one was administered.  He said he had looked up the symptoms that it might be a frozen shoulder/nerve issue.

                                                Roughly 15 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started to develop muscle aches. Within 30 minutes of the aches, they became severe. Aches were primarily located in the lower back, shoulders, hips, and calves. 30 minutes following,  I started to feel very fatigued and had labored breathing. Another 1.5 later, I developed chills and had flu like symptoms. By the afternoon, I had broken into a fever and had mild nausea. Besides the muscle aches, as one symptom onset, the others seemed to fade away. By 5:00 in the evening, (roughly 25 hours after receipt of vaccine) the symptoms quickly subsided. The only residual side-effects within the rest of a 48 hour period were soreness in the area of the injection, and mild headache.

He took claritin to help with itch.  with his second vaccine today he became clammy,  and did not feel in his body, when asked his name he took a few moments to answer.  we advised he call a friend to take him home.

                                                Ever since receiving the vaccine, two months ago now, my left arm has had chronic pain usually radiating out from the injection site but sometimes spreading across my entire shoulder and down to my elbow. I also have quite a bit of pain depending on the motion I try to take and a fairly regular (and worsening) throbbing sensation around where the injection was. - I also regularly feel like I have no strength in my left arm/grip and it?s gotten to the point where it?s now affecting daily life.  Some days, the area around the site swells up and I feel a burning sensation instead of a painful pulsing or throbbing  Painkillers (ibuprofen) don?t seem to help very much though and sometimes I?ll wake up in the middle of the night from rolling onto my left arm and causing the pain to intensify.  I?m not sure if the pain is truly a side effect of the vaccine or if the volunteer performing the vaccine did something wrong when administering it.

Rash started in chest/upper torso and progressed to bilateral arms, back, upper buttocks, and thighs. Rash feels like a sunburn in that it makes the subject feel warm. Rash is blanchable and fully pinpoint-macular, no papules or plaques.   At approx. 36 hours post-vaccine, the rash had spread down both arms and up the neck, sparing the face. The rash gets intensely pruritic when scratched or itched. There is no pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, or other compromise of the subject&#39;s health or well-being.

                                                I had previously had above average soreness in the inject site, weakness in the arm with some swelling and redness, warm to the touch, but I awoke suddenly in the night around 2am in excruciating pain. The inject site felt as though someone had hit me with a sledgehammer and was significantly swollen, hot to the touch, and felt hard/stiff. I have broken bones before that hurt less than this event for comparison, this was solidly 9/10 on the pain scale. Ice was applied along with aspirin and acetaminophen. within 4-6hours the pain had slowly returned to a manageable level.

Does not itch. Does not hurt unless significant pressure is applied. 0/10 pain when not touching it, 1/10 when applying pressure. I first noticed it on the evening 7 days after receiving the vaccine. It doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal and the news stories about it say it isn&#39;t bad so I&#39;m not worried about it, but I figured I&#39;d report it anyways for your statistics.

                                                Had no symptoms prior to injection. After injection, quickly developed moderate pain at injection site that eventually became severe. Over the rest of the day, developed a severe headache, severe muscle aches (not just at injection site), severe fatigue, fever of 100.6F, moderate joint aches (not just in arm, but all over body - neck is worst), and general weakness (I almost fell walking to the bathroom and I&#39;m in decently good shape). Toward the evening, I started struggling with thermal homeostasis - I was simultaneously sweating and shivering. The combination of these was severe enough that I had extreme difficulty sleeping last night and woke up at least once an hour, getting &lt;6 hours of sleep after lying in bed for almost 12 hours. Right now (23h post vaccination), the pain at the injection site has gotten significantly less bad, but I still have a splitting headache, fever of 100.3F,  moderate fatigue/weakness, and mild muscle/joint pains across my whole body. I&#39;m unsure how much the headache this morning is from sleep deprivation.   At no point did I lose sense of smell or taste, have a sore throat, cough, runny nose/nasal congestion, or shortness of breath.

                                                Approximately two hours after injection, slight discomfort and soreness about 2 inches in radius below the the injection site, but not at the point of contact. Movement of the upper arm produced some levels of pain, but nothing noteworthy. It was uncomfortable to sleep on, though, so that was avoided. Lower arm unaffected.  The following morning,  the pain was immediately noticeable and made using the arm a severely difficult task. It was painful to move the forearm above stomach level, and essentially impossible to do any sort of heavy lifting with it. Pain relieving medication such as aspirin and ibuprofen helped in a minimal capacity, and was ultimately irrelevant in the healing process. These symptoms lasted the entirety of the day after the injection and most of the following day as well, subsiding mostly in the evening. Today (Thursday, third full day after), all pain and soreness/dullness are entirely gone. The second full day was easily the most intense in terms of pain.

Described as if &#34;someone punched me in the armpit.&#34; Symptoms worsened by the next morning, so on 2/22/2021 patient sought care at a local Urgent Care facility. Treating provider felt symptoms were most consistent with cellulitis of the right axilla. One week course of antibiotics (Bactrim 1 tab twice daily) was prescribed. Follow up with PCP was recommended for 2-3 days or sooner if symptoms worsened or additional symptoms presented. No laboratory testing or radiology procedures were performed. Patient filled prescription for antibiotics and started taking same day. On 2/25/2021 patient reported that symptoms were improving but not completely resolved.

Red swelling that is warm to the touch and slight itchiness.  Extends around from the tricep to bicep and mostly below the injection site, down to near the elbow. No pain besides that of a normal IM vaccination.  Currently still experiencing the symptoms, but not taking any treatment as none are necessary.

There is swelling in about a two-inch diameter. The swollen place is hard to the touch.   I was advised by a pharmacist that this is not serious and to monitor the area.

                                                I administered the Moderna vaccine and had the patient sit down for 15 minutes for observation.  5 minutes later the patient complained of flushing in the chest and face.  His face was slightly red on one side.  The patient stated he was breathing normally, but wasn&#39;t sure if it was an allergic reaction.  As a precaution I offered 50 mg of diphenhydramine to the patient, and he accepted and took it by mouth.  I offered to call paramedics, patient refused.  I observed the patient for 20 min more, and at the end of the 20 min the patient felt better and went home.

                                                I randomly got hives and its lasted about 2 weeks now. Once the Benadryl runs out then I start to feel an itch and the itch leaded to that whole area red and bumpy. The only thing I have gotten so far is a steroid and Benadryl. only thing that works is the Benadryl.   When I first went into the ER I went because I got hive and ive never had hives before in my life.   I went 3 days later because I had a migraine, felt sick and had trouble swallowing.

                                                The day after the shot the area with the shot was tender and felt painful to the touch. It was also difficult to raise my arm past 45 degrees without some pain. Around 24 hours after the shot was administered, I started to feel more immense pain and swelling around the area of the shot and now felt pain even when my arm was resting, with the sensation sometimes traveling to my fingers. Taking two tylenol helped reduce the swelling and the pain significantly after about 20-35 minutes.

I had chills, a headache, fatigue, and nausea. The chills were severe. I couldn&#39;t get much sleep. In the morning and throughout the next day, I maintained a fever between 99 and 100 and felt fatigued and loss of appetite. I took 2 iBruprofen at 200mg each ever 4-6 hours. The fever never broke. I took NyQuil at 8PM on 4/8/21 to subdue the fever. I had night sweats and slept through the night. Today on 4/9/21 I have no fever. Although,  my arm is swollen at the injection site, red, and in pain. I am icing it and moving it around to subdue the swelling.

Chills and fever began roughly 31 hours after vaccination, which reached 101.5 F within 2 hours. I took 200mg Advil to manage the fever and discomfort and went to bed. I ran a low grade fever of roughly 100 F for most of the third day, and took another 200mg Advil at one point. All symptoms disappeared by the fourth day.

Patient took off bandaid and noticed site of injection was red and skin looked as if it was starting to peel.  Patient reported no other symptoms besides being uncomfortable at the injection site. When he came in for second dose, I, the nurse noticed the peeling of the skin left a scar and was not given in the deltoid muscle, but rather to the side towards axillary.  Patient mentioned on prevaccination checklist, &#34;not bad but some of my skin peeled off. my dad asked his fellow doctors and they thought it was because the dose was administered to the shallow front of my shoulder rather than to the side as is customary&#34;

                                                During my first vaccine I experienced a bruise on my arm that lasted ~3 weeks. My arm swelled (including my fingers which looked like sausages) for a few hours that night.  I also felt like I experienced slight chest congestion for a week or two after. The second vaccine (lot number listed on this form) I have a bruise that in my opinion is worse than the one from the first shot.  The bruise is still present after 1 week. I also feel slight tenderness around the joint area. I have not heard of these symptoms being advertise Will this cause joint damage? Additionally form both vaccines I experienced fever, body aches and obviously a sore arm.

                                                Around early evening on Tuesday, April 20, 2021, I began feeling a bump on my forehead. Over the next few hours, it continued to become shiny and more bumps formed around it, growing to the size of slightly larger than a quarter. It was associated very mild isolated pain at the site. In the morning of April 21, it appeared more oily, but did not increase in size. No other irritation was found throughout the body. I do have a history of some type of skin rash (possibly shingles or HSV-1) which flares up once every year or two, which I believe this is the same occurrence.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine  About 8 hours after receiving the second dose of Moderna, almost all of the side effects came in full force including headache, dizziness, fatigue, full body aches, injection site pain, chills, and elevated temperature. The peak severity lasted about 4-5 hours. It wasn&#39;t possible to sleep at all the night after the shot. After that 5 hour period, lingering side effects included headache, fatigue, and aches. About 22 hours after the shot, I decided to take some Tylenol to help get rid of the residual side effects. At 24 hours after the shot, it appears most effects have subsided but there is residual dizziness and some fatigue and weakness.

I then felt it and noticed a raised, red, and very warm bump that grew throughout the day and continued to grow the following day. On the third day after discovery, the bump and redness went away and now I feel a dull achy pain at the injection site.

                                                1 minute after administration of vaccine, patient lost consciousness and fell from chair striking the right side of head on pavement. He was rolled from prone, assessed and had a pulse but initially was not breathing. 911 called Within 10 second, had spontaneous return of respirations, consciousness and was oriented to person, place, time. Sustained an abrasion to his head, complaints of mild HA, no neck pain or signs of cervical injury or other trauma. Vitals monitored. Given fluids, juice. Assessed by paramedics and refused transport to ED for further evaluation. Given ice and called a friend for a ride home. Observed for nearly 1 hour after LOC and had returned to baseline mentation. Advised to call 911 or go to ED if worsening of HA, vision changes, confusion, falls, nausea, vomiting due to concerns for head trauma. Assessment is that this was likely a vasovagal episode and patient reported similar experience with immunization in past, in retrospect. Discussed that this is not a contraindication for 2nd dose but that he should be sure he is well hydrated and advise healthcare providers of history of vasovagal with first dose. The county will work with him to schedule 2nd dose at a health clinic attended by EMS (on site).

                                                I have had constant ringing in my ears for the past few days. It has not gone away yet and has been especially noticeable at night. I also noticed a sudden pain in my chest around noon on 5/1/21 that felt like someone had punched my sternum and bruised it. That has also not gone away yet. It hurts to put any pressure on my palms or lift anything heavy.

                                                About a week after I got the vaccine, I started feeling muscle pain in my left arm (the same arm where  got the vaccine), even though the initial muscle pain had gone away 2-3 days after I got the vaccine.  The pain seemed to be mostly around the muscle where the vaccine was injected, but sometimes spread to other nearby muscles as well. 24 hours after that, a red spot (that was hot to the touch) appeared at the bottom of the muscle, an inch or two below the actual vaccination site. The pain was mostly gone by then, but the red spot is still there. I don&#39;t know how serious this is or if/when it will go away.

A few minutes after the vaccinations  pt started to develop a rash around his neck he also started complaining of shortness of breath . All these happened in a spun of about 5 minutes. He was offered assistance in the form of water but pt declined . Patient felt okay and rejected as calling 911 and also an epipen shot. He indicated that he hears those shots are crazy and flat out refused. He decided to have his wife drive him to the ER. I called later to check up on him but his wife  said he was fine and that they were almost at the ER. Will follow up tomorrow

                                                Delayed skin reaction - hives  I woke up the morning of Sunday (May 9 2021 - 14 days after 2nd Moderna shot) with a mostly full body hive reaction, concentrated especially on my thighs, but the hives reached all the way to the back and top of my head. Face was hive free. Hives are itchy but not unbearable if left alone. Treated with 2 benadryl (Diphenhydramine HCI, 25 mg), reaction went down. Later that same evening, hive reaction returned and worsened over the evening, this time the hives were concentrated on my forearms, especially on my right arm (injection site). The actual local injection site on the shoulder remained relatively hive free. Hives grew and joined together into large blotches. Treated with 3 benadryl. The next morning (May 10) I woke up my arms relatively hive free although there are some minor blotches. Now I have minor red blotches on my face and neck, and some on my lower legs. Treating with 1 benadryl. Will likely not seek medical attention unless hives worsen dramatically. No other symptoms - breathing is fine.   Unclear whether this is actually a reaction to the Moderna vaccine, but it is my best guess. There have been no changes to my diet, medications, or behavior. Bed sheets and clothing have been washed and changed without an effect on the reaction. I am not experiencing elevated stress. The concentration of the hives is moving around my body, so it doesn&#39;t appear to be the result of skin exposure or contact.

As patient was standing to get vaccination card filled out, he told associate to call RPH that he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ran out to give my attention and patient was sweating and looked dizzy. His eyes started to shut while he was standing and as I was holding his arm and back to support him he started to fall to the ground. Patient gently went to the ground, I pushed him over to one side and he was out for about 3 seconds and woke back up. Patient was very hot and sweaty. He wanted to move to a more private area so I made an area with a privacy panel available to him. Patient stated to me that he has no history of seizure, but suffers from mild anxiety. Myself or one of the associates was with him for approximately 45 minutes just to make sure he was ok. His blood pressure was taken (twice) and water was given. His BP readings were normal. Patient was on his way. Moderna series completed.

I felt like my head was going to explode, and I took ibuprofen and Tylenol. I also had a fever and excruciating pain at the injection site, this all went away within 3 days. On 05/07/2021 I woke up with a really bad headache and I was dizzy, I took ibuprofen and Tylenol and it seemed to be getting better. And finally on 05/11/2021 I woke up again with a headache and dizziness, this is the day I went to my primary care doctor and he told me that he has seen this pretty frequently with the moderna vaccine. He said that it was brain swelling and inflammation. He told me to take ibuprofen and Tylenol every 6 hours for a week and that if I was still experiencing these side effects then I can come back and he will prescribe me steroids. It has now been 3 days, and my head still hurts and doesn?t feel normal. He also told me that if I get tingling in my fingers or blurred vision to go to an emergency room right away.

                                                I first noticed I was itchy on the evening of 5/11 and noticed hives on my body the next morning. They continued to get worse for several days and appeared on all parts of my body from head to toe. I noticed my feet hurt and that I was showing signs of angioedema beginning on 5/14 and peaking the next day. I also experienced joint/tendon pain in the evening of 5/16 between my legs and feet (upper ankle). I still have hives today. The hives were particularly bad in high-touch areas, near the armpits, lower arms, pelvis areas. I took Benadryl occasionally which helped but at no point did the hives go away.

I also experienced the common fatigue. However, at 12:13a.m on May 25th, I was woken from sleeping to what can only be described as either the most severe case of the shakes that have ever been experienced, or convulsions. I was unable to move, speak, and could hardly breathe. The effects of this lasted well over an hour and a half. It was only after what I was experiencing stopped, that I suddenly became burning hot, but did not have a fever. 98.7° was what was read at the time I started to feel hot. Since then I have experienced severe joint and knuckle pain on my left hand, still bicep soreness, pain in my left forearm, again joint and knuckle pain in my left hand, and headaches.

Today the hives spread to all over his body including face.   I recommended he call his primary md and could take Benadryl 25mg  - 1 q 6 hours.  If 1 did not help in about an hour I told him he had the option to take another Benadryl 25mg.   I warned of extreme drowsiness and not to drive.  Patient was very calm and seemed to appreciate the advice.

                                                Friday (Day of shot): Fairly typical symptoms (soreness in arm, cough and sore throat, headache, and fatigue) Saturday (24hrs): Same symptoms as above, but slightly worse than day before. In addition, both feet (on top) began itching later into day. Sunday (48 hrs):  Typical symptoms began disappearing, itch on feet became more intense, bottoms of feet and ankles started to itch as well. Monday (72 hours): Typical symptoms virtually disappeared. Itching became progressively worse throughout the day on feet/ankles, and various small areas of body (abdomin, back of knees, inside of elbows/forearms) became itchy. Hives and rashes noticed over entire body later in afternoon. Hives/rashes were either single (unraised) isolated red dots, clustered and raised red patches, or clusters of small &#34;braille-like&#34; bumps (clusters and bumps area-size ranged anywhere from quarter-sized to palm-sized). Most noticeable areas were upper left back/shoulder, both sides of abdomin, groin, front/inner thighs, behind both knees, inner forearms, and both ankles and feet (top and bottom). Sore throat also came back on Monday afternoon, and over ~2 hr became itchy, then constricted with trouble swallowing, then restricted/strained breathing. Went to ER after noticed trouble swallowing, given epinehrine shot in  left leg. Throat slowly went back to normal over the next 1-2 hours. From 05/18 through today (3 weeks, and still ongoing),  rashes and hives have been diminished in size and amount, but are present both in pre-existing and new areas of body. Rashes/hives may last 1-2 days after developing or be on-going (feet and ankles). No prior history of allergies. No change in diet, lifestyle, soaps/detergents, environment at time of reaction.

                                                Skin reaction developed approximately 12-24 hours following 2nd dose of Moderna COVID19 vaccination. Significant fatigue also occurred. No side effects were noted following 1st dose (one month prior to 2nd dose).  Severe skin reaction primarily concentrated at both palms (redness, irritation, minor painfulness) and both feet (irritation, visible rash). Skin reactions also occurred on upper chest and full back (redness, itchiness). Reactions are still present but have begun to subside about 120 hours after injection.

The reaction was about 2 inches by 2 inches in a circle directly at the injection site. This reaction lasted about an hour before swelling and hives dissipated. Redness is still active 2 hours prior as I am writing this.

The pain has improved but rash is still present. I was advised to go to the ER and be evaluated. I went down around 2245 received Pepcid and Benadryl and was told to follow up with my primary care provider and an allergist prior to second dose.  The next day the rash spread to my stomach and chest&#34;

                                                Around 10 Days after his first shot he developed an erythematous patch on his R forehead measuring about a 1.5cmx1.8cm. A few days after that he developed a similar sized lesion on his R anterior shoulder with a similar appearance. The patch was erythematous, not really raised, not pruritic, painful or otherwise. This was not very concerning. However about 4 days after getting his second dose similar erythematous lesions erupted diffusely over his entire back and shoulders, some on his neck as well as medial R upper arm. Lesions were similar in color and appearance to his original lesions but smaller all measuring &lt;1cm^2 in no particular pattern. This prompted his physician to give a topical antifungal body wash. At the time pt also requested treatment for his face and body acne and was treated with doxycycline which had worked well for him previously. For the following 5 days (9 days after the 2nd dose) he used the antifungal 3x and the rash began to fade. Today 3/8/21 the rash is very faint but still visible in fluorescent light how

                                                One day after my first COVID19 vaccine, I experienced chills, headache, and myalgia when I woke up that day. I took two 500mg tablets of extra strength Acetaminophen to reduce the severity of my symptoms. And two more tablets six hours later to prevent further symptom severity. When I received my second dose one month later, began experiencing the same symptoms as before. But at 10:00pm of that day. And I experienced pain and discomfort at the injection sight. These symptoms were again reduced by appropriate doses and intervals of Acetaminophen. These general symptoms and injection site symptoms continued for one more day.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Heavy fatigue, muscle and joint pain primarily in the back, chills, nausea and vomiting (2 instances of vomiting), and fever on and off that maxed out at 100.9 degrees. These began around 1AM approximately 9 hours after vaccination.  Side effects most strongly felt within 36 hours of receiving vaccination.  Continued fatigue, chills, night sweats and muscle pain for two additional days (Thursday 3/11, Friday 3/12) that gradually subsided over those days. Appeared to be a slight rash around the injection site for several days after. I previously had the COVID-19 virus in late March 2020.

                                                On March 18th I experienced normal side effects (fatigue, body aches, chills, along with soreness of the injection site).  Starting on March 19th, I experienced mild shortness of breath for 3 days.  I checked my O2 sat throughout those 3 days and never dropped below 98%.  My wife experienced the same shortness of breath for the same period of time with a low of 97% on her O2 sat.  She received a Covid test on the last day of her symptoms and received a negative result.  Now, on March 25th I have developed a red, circular rash at the injection site (upper portion of left arm).  It is itchy, warm, and has a firm feel, roughly 2.5 inches in diameter with a slight, inward, crescent-shaped curve of the red patch on one side.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

Symptoms were treated through 03/09/21 with topical hydrocortisone, diphenhydramine, and lidocaine cream along with increased dosage of antihistamines with marginal improvement following treatments. Symptoms appeared to be worsening after each day. No significant changes were made to detergents, soaps, diet, medications, or environment prior to symptoms. PCP visited on 03/10/21 who prescribed prednisone for two weeks and famotidine (OTC). Symptoms quickly improved, with small rash breakouts periodically over the course of treatment. Symptoms subsided following conclusion of prednisone treatment.

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine  at 2:55pm on 4/7.  An hour or two later, I started to get a sore throat.  The sore throat was very painful by the early morning of 4/8.  On 4/8 I went into a doctor to see if I had strep throat because of the level of pain and since I didn&#39;t think I could get a sore throat from the vaccine, but he said it was not strep and that it was likely just a side effect of the vaccine.  On 4/8 I also had a fever topping 101.4, fatigue (I slept a lot that day), mental fog, pain at injection site, and all-around body pain.  The sore throat lessened greatly by 4/9, so it clearly wasn&#39;t a strep infection and seems it was indeed a side effect of the vaccine.  From 4/9 through 4/11 I had general &#34;cold&#34; symptoms: runny nose, phlegmy, watery eyes, redness and pain at injection site, muscle aches, elevated temperature (not fever), and general fatigue. By 4/12, these symptoms are nearly completely gone.  Some of these symptoms seemed quite strange as side effects from the vaccine, but they started and perfectly paralleled the expected vaccine side-effects, which makes me think they were caused by the vaccine.  I have no reason to think I had another illness at the same time as when I was experiencing these side-effects.  I had had Covid-19 previously (in December 2020; I tested positive and had mild symptoms).  Perhaps having had Covid-19 already provoked these strange side-effects.

                                                Injection site was left arm below the shoulder around the tricep.  The injection site began itching several hours after injection. Itching was low in intensity.  The injection site swelled noticeably.  I went to sleep but I woke around 4 AM with an intense headache, nausea, slightly blurred vision, and a fever. Throughout the remaining day my fever got up to 101F.  Other symptoms included muscle ache and fatigue.  The injection site began intermittently pulsating/twitching the evening of 5/20/21.  On Friday morning 5/21 the intermittent twitching spread to my left fingers.   The blurry vision, headache, and nausea gradually went away.  All symptoms were gone by morning of 5/22.  I did not take any medication throughout.

But everyday I?m getting more and more bumps, and when I looked at a picture of hives, these bumps look very similar. The first ones look like big mosquito bites or spider bites. But the next day I got small bumps that looked more like hives. The big bumps are on my right arm, but not next to where I got my shot. The hives are on my right ankle, and now are popping up on my right arm. They are every itchy, and a bit disconcerting because they are growing in size and spreading more each day.

Rash was painful at first, has diminished over the last 48 hours to a dull itch and painful only when touched/pressed directly. Rash is warm to the touch. Swelling is still present but has declined. Appears to be gradually improving as of this report. Did not experience reaction from first dose, as far as I can recall (only experienced normal arm pain).

I barely slept because my arm and shoulder hurt so bad, and I also was sweating and shivering. I woke up many times.   At 8am on 06/24 I woke up with a severe headache and nausea. My injection arm and shoulder was very sore. My body overall ached, joints and muscles. I almost called into work but decided to go.   I took 500mg of acetaminophen at 10:25am.  At 10:30am at work, I was still very sore and noticed I was mildly disoriented. My coworkers commented on my look of fatigue.  Around 1pm, my disorientation and fatigue began to alleviate somewhat, and my headache had resolved by that time.  Currently it is 8:51pm. I worked the whole day at work, though it was difficult with the body aches and exhaustion. I have a mild headache, general fatigue and soreness, and my  injection arm is still very sore.

                                                Immediately following first shot I had the normal pain associated with vaccinations. Pain continued throughout a 2 week period where 3 of those days were bad enough to be bed ridden. Heat rash formed after 2 weeks with red splotchy skin around injection site. Moderate to severe burning sensation in muscle different from initial reaction.  Pain subsided for another week and came back with a now worse burning pain when moving (my) left arm and rash is now currently scaly and dry with continued burning pain up to 6/24/21 one month after injection. Pain has reduced but stinging still continues and rash still present

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

                                                Moderna vaccine dose #1 received in right shoulder on 12/31/20 at 2:15PM. Injection was uneventful other than sensation of pressure. I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head. I am concerned with the possibility of long term and/or permanent damage after reviewing the literature. I am also concerned about how many other healthcare workers the person who gave me my vaccine may be injuring and/or causing permanent harm to.

                                                Patient received 1st dose of Moderna at approximately 12:30pm on 3/18/21. He did not stay the recommended 15 minutes on site for observation. He drove himself back to vaccination clinic parking lot at approximately 1:40pm and got out of his car hurriedly to get his mask from the trunk before speaking with EMS on site. He then reported to EMS his wife witnessed him have a seizure (eyes rolled back, unresponsive, stiffening of arms and legs) for 2-3 min approximately 1 hour after receiving his shot. He reported when he regained responsiveness he asked his wife what had happened as he reportedly had no recollection of the seizure, they decided to call the patient&#39;s sister and she directed them to return to site of vaccination to report his seizure.  EMS who evaluated patient reported he denied (and was not exhibiting) postictal signs/symptoms when he arrived back in parking lot at vaccination site. He denied having a history of seizures or any medical conditions. EMS also reported that neither the patient nor his wife called 911 after the seizure. Patient declined any further medical evaluation/follow up. EMS urged him to call 911 if he had anymore seizure activity to which he replied he thought if he just rested Friday and through the weekend, he&#39;d be fine to return to work on Monday.

At first they were thought to be mosquito bites, however the bumps continues to appear in the following day despite patient staying indoors with no pests identified inside the home. They were then thought to be bedbugs, but no other family members (wife and child) experienced any bites or bumps despite sleeping in the same bed. All other causes have been ruled out - no new medications, stress, exercise, new soaps/detergents, new skin cleansing techniques, nothing at all that can explain this urticaria other than the vaccination.

                                                About a week (6 days) after I had my first Moderna shot, Inflammation of the hands and fingers started in the forms or red/skin color welts like Hives. Excessive burning and itching sensations, difficult even to wash or rub hands together, scratching was increasing the pain and was resulting in swelling of fingers. Fingertips had pain gotten super sensitive with inflammation.  Couldn&#39;t even form my fist because of swelling and pain. Had a lot of discomfort and difficulty sleeping so took a Tylenol PM one night to reduce the inflammation and to aid the sleep. Only took it once as not much of a fan of medicines. I also soaked my hands in water with baking soda which provided some comfort and reduced the pain and inflammation, applied some coconut oil to soothe the inflammation.  As I thought it was happening because of hives and/or excessive heat increase in the body, I changed my diets, started with foods and ingredients that cools down the body which felt like working and the swelling, pain, burning/itching sensations were slowly pacifying in 3-4 days. I also got acupuncture treatment after 5 days which has helped a lot now. Now after a week and all that I did, I don&#39;t feel the pain and burning sensations anymore, no swelling and the skin is getting clear, red spots/welts are disappearing and I am able to sleep better.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Friday around 2:45pm. Felt zero symptoms beside soreness at the injection site, until about 10pm, when I became extremely overheated quite suddenly. I was trying to exit the building to get into cold air when I fainted twice. I was unconscious for 5 seconds or fewer each time. I did not hit my head or sustain any injury from the falls.  Paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later, by which time I had regained consciousness and felt fine aside from weakness, dehydration, and some temperature fluctuation. They said my vitals were perfect and I went home from there. I was feeling completely fine and back to normal by 6pm the next day.

The  diameter of the rash expanded significantly as time went on, beginning as a fairly sizeable but tight and contained circle then transforming into a ring-like, more narrow halo. The rash was painful when pressure was applied to the site and caused great discomfort.

                                                Noticed hives about an hour after getting the shot forming all around my body.  Thought it was normal as the covid rash.  Quickly started feeling ill. Had a small amount of trouble breathing and a fever with swelling  and the hives became larger as my skin was flushed. Googled it and it said that this was a normal reaction and common side effects.  So I did not do anything and fell asleep because I felt badly. The next day I woke up to see the bumps all over my body including my digits and pelvic region. Called and talked to my wife she told me to go to the hospital. I started feeling a bit better though and decided against it and took rest that day. The following day the rash had become raised and tender across my body.

I did not need to treat the bruise or seek professional medical aid. It eventually went away on its own and I have not noticed anything else around the site or had any related symptoms since.

Third day was completely fine (4/20), Morning of fourth day (4/21) wave of dizziness and fatigue began accompanied with feeling of pressure in ears with occasional ringing. Also headache at the back of the head and where the cervical spine meets the skull. Occasional congestion. Hard to concentrate and occasional lightheaded feeling. Going on one week since injection and 3rd day of dizzy spells. (4/24)  Treatment: Drinking mostly water. Diet consisting mostly of vegetables and grains (no changes have been made to my diet) Ibuprofen 200mg seems to alleviate earache which in turn relieves some dizziness but feeling of being off balance remains.  No previous history of any sort of vertigo or ear infections.

                                                PT was given the Moderna vaccine around 12:15pm. Pt did not seem in any distress at time of injection. After injection, he moved to an observation area chair with armrests. He appeared to have a vaso-vagal response around 12:20pm causing him to pass out and fall out of chair. He hit his head on the floor causing a minor laceration on left eyebrow and some bleeding. He appeared to have some swelling around eyebrow and forehead area. His mother accompanied him and informed us post-injection that this has happened in the past, that he had syncope related events from vaccine. The paramedics were called and the PT was taken to the local hospital for further evaluation.

                                                30 April 2021: I had slight soreness at the site of injection that morning that gradually got a little worse overall by the evening... no other noticeable symptoms. Had a protein bar and cold brew coffee for breakfast prior to vaccination. Approx. 45 min after the vaccination I ate a donut, then an hour later a ham &amp; swiss sandwich for lunch. For diner approx. 8 hours later, I ate a KFC chicken sandwich and an order of popcorn chicken.  01 May 2021:  I woke up with it feeling a bit more sore than in the evening... still very tolerable though... 3/10 overall on a pain chart... throughout the morning through mid-afternoon I felt no other noticeable symptoms. Ate a protein bar and some cold brew coffee for breakfast that morning, but nothing else before my AE.  At 17:05 Pacific I get a work-related phone call from a client (I work in IT as an executive support specialist) and assist them for approx. 30-40 minutes. At that point I&#39;m working on my laptop sitting cross-legged in bed.  Adverse event: During that call, I start to notice that I&#39;m slightly more sensitive to motion as usual, making me dizzy if I move around too much. By the end of the call, I&#39;m feeling dizzy but I attribute it to hunger. Some time around 18:30 Pacific, I go downstairs to eat. However, by the time I get downstairs and try to prepare some sushi, I feel so dizzy I need to sit down on the couch to stop the room from spinning. I go upstairs a couple minutes later to try and sleep it off. I&#39;m laying on my back at that point. I think I rested for about 25-35 minutes with my room dark. I then get up slowly to see if things got better but everything is still spinning and is getting worse. I try to rest in bed more, alternating laying on my back and my right side but it&#39;s still getting worse. Sometime around approx. 20:00 Pacific, I go to the bathroom to puke but nothing really comes out since I hadn&#39;t eaten since the morning. I go back to my room to try and sleep it all off.  From that evening on 01 May 2021 to 04 May 2021, I&#39;d sleep 12-15 hours on average each day to get rid of the nausea and dizziness. I normally sleep 6-7.5 hours (bad sleeping habits due to work/surfing the web on phone - never resulted in these symptoms before though). It gradually went away until going away almost completely by the 04 May. However, as of 10 May I still feel like the potential for the nausea is there... just ever so slightly lingering as a slight heavy feeling in my head that feels like it will spiral out of control if I start spinning around too much. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just due to my relative lack of sleep since 05 May (more bad sleeping habits). Otherwise, I feel back to normal.

                                                The first day after I received the vaccine I experienced symptoms in guidance with all available resources. I was fatigued, my arm was sore at the sight of injection. I remember sleeping at least 12 hours.  A few days later I began to experience severe intermittent chest pain. The area under my arm was extremely tender, as were the area behind my left knee. The adverse event as stated in the report was a sudden jolt of searing pain on my left side. It lasted only a few moments and felt like it traveled from my left shoulder down to my left thigh and behind my knee. It nearly knocked me off my feet. I remained with a lingering pain in my leg and upper left back until today.  I reached out the pharmacist  who administered the vaccine about the side effects and she advised me to immediately contact my doctor&#39;s office. I visited my doctor&#39;s office yesterday (6/3/21) and he assured me I didn&#39;t have any blood clots. He advised me to use a heating pad for the pain in my leg. He also said that sometimes the lingering side effects from the vaccine may last weeks in rare cases. Those discomforts are finally starting to subside. I had no treatment outside of elevated levels of hydration, taking Tylenol and resting.

It was painful to move (the same as it was the day after the shot).  The next morning the swelling had gone down and the red was fading.  It is almost completely back to normal as of 1/13/21.

                                                He was in the care of his mother, due to him being Mentally Handicapped. Approximately 10 to 15 minutes after he received the vaccine both of his forearms started to turn red in color. He stated that they were itching. He had no other adverse reactions. Being he was not short of breath and had no facial or tongue swelling, no nausea or vomiting, it was decided that his mother would take him home and contact his primary care provider for direction or she would possibly give him some Benadryl at home and follow up with his PCP as needed. If any other reactions developed she would take him to the Emergency Department if needed. They left the vaccine clinic approximately 40 - 45 minutes after he had received the vaccine.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

                                                During afternoon, my left arm felt sore. At 10:00 pm started having body aches. I woke up around 2:00 am and I had a high fever and I was having trouble breathing. My fingertips had turned blue. My oxygen level was about 92%. I took ibuprofen and that brought the fever back down. I had body aches the next day. My cough had gotten worse (that I had at time of vaccination).  I went to Urgent Care on January 6, 2021.  They did the COVID test that day. I had a sinus infection - antibiotics were prescribed.  It took about two weeks for symptoms to resolve.

                                                Rash on the chest, neck and upper back. Rash turned bright red, then after steroids, lessened but stayed in ?splotches?. Rash was itchy at times. Felt body aches and slight chills (temperature always below 98.6 though).   Began 50mg oral prednisone on 3/6. On 3/7, rash worsened and an urgent care facility gave me a 10mg shot of dexamethesone which helped immediately.   Dermatologist recommended antihistamine course beginning 3/9.

                                                Patient received his vaccine at 12:15 PM. Around 1:10PM he stated he started to feel &#34;fuzzy&#34; and &#34;euphoric&#34; almost. He was dazed and said he just felt off. When he stood up, he fell down and felt very dizzy.  We were doing a vaccine clinic at his place of employment that day so I was still on site and he came back into the room I was stationed around 1:30pm. He said he felt ok, was talking, breathing fine, just felt a little &#34;off.&#34; He had white spots all over his left arm and some on his right.   None were raised, red, or itchy. His left hand was red/purple in color. I gave 50mg of diphenhydramine and he stated about 10 minutes later he felt better.  I observed him for approximately another hour. He was walking around, talking fine and stated he felt normal when he left. He still had some slight discoloration on his left arm.

Between 24 and 48 hours after the shot, about 3 inches below the injection site, I noticed my arm began swelling, getting very red, and radiating heat in patches. Over the next few days, it grew until it completely covered from the middle of my upper arm to my elbow. Sunday, March 28th, the redness and swelling is fading finally but still noticeable. Also the 3 nights following my shot, I dealt with severe lightheadedness and dizziness, but only at night

The morning after, the patient had body aches and a headache, and took 500mg of acetaminophen at approximately 5am.  The patient also noticed swelling at the injection site (raised and approx 5 inches in diameter) and itching at this time as well. The patient took another 500mg of acetaminophen at 2pm, 200mg of ibuprofen at 3pm, and complained of a sensation of hypersensitivity and mild &#34;burning&#34; across the skin. These symptoms subsided by about 5pm, and patient felt well enough to stand up and have a small meal before returning to bed. At that point (~5pm), they developed a low fever (temp fluctuated between 99.5-100.6F), and took 400mg of ibuprofen and another 500mg of acetaminophen, and their temperature reduced to 98.6 at approximately 8PM. Afterwards, the patient had fatigue and some aches, and the swollen arm has not subsided at the time of report entry (~42 hours after vaccination).

Upon running over, I noticed that the patients eyes rolled in the back of his head, his legs were straight out, and was making &#34;groaning&#34; noises. He was in this state for about 30 seconds. 9-1-1 was called immediately and patient was given water. When asked if he knew where he was, he stated &#34;a pharmacy store for my COVID shot.&#34; He told me he remembers everything, saying he felt like he was in a dream during seizure. Questioned if he had ever had seizures before and he stated once when he was giving blood. No shortness of breath or hives noticed, therefore no EpiPen was administer. Ambulance arrived and asked similar questions that we had asked, and patient stated he was &#34;just hot.&#34; He also seemed a bit yellow in color. Patient was able to stand up and walk to the ambulance with little to no help. All of this occurred in about 10 minutes total.

                                                Began with soreness in the arm at the site of the injection, several hours after the vaccine was administered. Progressed around 4PM to slight fatigue, headache whenever head was moved too quickly. Fatigue and headache worsened to the point that I took Acetominophen to counteract the headache at 9 PM. Went to bed at 10 PM Felt overheated during the night, but slept decently until I felt the need to urinate at ~4AM. Fell back into a half-sleep until 8AM or so. Performed my daily exercise routine (40 decline pushups, 40 pushups, 40 incline pushups, 50 situps, and 50 unweighted squats), noticed overheating more easily than normal, considerable fatigue, and headache whenever moving the head too rapidly. Had temperature taken midway through, 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Took Acetominophen for the headache around 9:30 AM. Experienced intense fatigue over the course of the day, general feeling of being overheated, and headache persisted, but felt no need for medication. Also found intense soreness in the arms (probably related to my exercise routine which involves 120 pushups altogether?) Went to bed at 10 PM. Again, woke up to relieve bladder at ~4 AM then fell back asleep. In the morning, fatigue lifted, still have a general feeling of being too warm, headache has lessened to only when I raise my voice, soreness in arms persists.

                                                After the first day, I started to have minor arm pain at the injection site. I periodically used and ice pack and I took some advil.  2 days later, I woke up several times in the middle of the night with chest pain and shortness of breath. I felt paralyzed and just went back to sleep a few times. Around 6am,  I woke up and changed to sleeping in a chair in a sitting position as I felt a little less pressure on my chest while doing so. After I finally woke up a couple of hours later, my symptoms were more bearable although I did still feel chest pressure and slight shortness of breath, it did not seem like an emergency any more. These symptoms continued on into the next couple of days and started to go away with time.

I feel these are side effects of vaccine as i never had such feeling before for any medication.

                                                On Sunday evening, January 10th, I started becoming increasingly itchy in my face. I noticed it was blotchy and I had hives. My scalp was also very irritated. When I showered later that evening, I noticed that I had red dots on various parts of my body. This has since by diagnosed as dermatitis. On Monday &amp; Tuesday, the 11 and 12 respectively, the hives, blotchiness and general irritation to my face and scalp got worse and I was very itchy.. The dermatitis continued to spread across my body include my torso &amp; arms. My upper thigh also has some red dots but the rest of my legs, to date, appear to be okay. As of this writing, my entire body is itchy, but is general discomfort and hardly debilitating. As a note, I have not changed my laundry soap, bath soap, eaten anything different, etc as possible explanations for my hives and dermatitis. The only thing new in the last week and half has been the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine

The area around my ear remained 98.7*F. As it progressed I developed minor amounts of blotchy red areas along the hairline on the left side of my face only.

I have had significant amount of vaccines and immunizations from the civilian and military sectors and never suffered this before.

The rash was dark red, was warm to the touch, and felt tight. No increased pain or itching. I took a antihistamine the following day and these seemed to help reduce the rash. It was gone after 4 days.

Shingles healing right as I got second shot on March 5th and had same high fever sick reaction as first week of second shot but with diarrhea this time which I did not have the first time.

                                                One week and one day after receiving the Moderna vaccine my left arm, the one the vaccine was injected into, became bright red and warm to the touch. It has also become itchy on one or two occasions.  A large portion of my shoulder/arm has swollen up  over the past day and remained swollen for about 12 hours. There has also been an aching pain in my left arm pit. I have not gone into the Dr. regarding this as the symptoms appear minor and related to the vaccine.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I started to feel slight pain in the injection site (my arm) reminiscent of a bruise. An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

I was able to sleep soundly through the night. No affects the following day or since.

I pretty much had the same symptoms as the first dose: chills, body aches. headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue. It lasted for about 3-4 days. Now, I stared with bloody stools with my first dose and it never really resolved before I got the second dose. I noticed it increased the frequency, made it a little worse after the second dose. They were not so frequent anymore. I still have blood in my stool at least 2 times a week.

After a couple of mins the pt stood up and began to pace the room, at which time I asked the pt if he was ok and he responded that he was fine, but just a few moments later the pt got light headed and fell against the wall. He caught himself, but still hit the side of his head against the wall and this caused a small cut. The pt was immediately moved to sit on the floor with his back against the wall and at this point he seemed to lose conciousness and was moved to lying down. Pts BP was low for several mins, but improved to normal by the time EMS arrived. Pts vitals were checked by EMS and he was cleared to go home with his wife.

                                                Initial signs of shingles occured around 13 days after the first Moderna shot. April 13 at 8pm, thoracic back pain started. It was localized to a small region next to the spin on the right side. April 16-17 a small rash started to develop which looked similar to a bug bite. Back pain has been continuous during this time. April 21, the rash has since developed in a strip wrapping around from my back to my lower chest. Visited a  doctor who then confirmed it to be a &#34;text book&#34; example shingles. Since the 72 hour window was missed for antivirals to be used, pain killers and steroids were prescribed to treat symptoms.

                                                On 4/12/21, nearly a week after my first dose of the vaccine, I experienced intense, sharp pains in the left side of my neck. The pain was intermittent throughout the day and didn&#39;t seem to be triggered or alleviated by any specific action, It coincided with a slightly enlarged, hard lymph node along my left external jugular vein, about two inches below my ear lobe. The pain persisted (intermittently) lasting no longer than one to three seconds each time, or in some cases pulsing on and off for 30 seconds. In total, I counted roughly a dozen of these episodes between 4/12 and 4/13. The lymph node has since decreased in size and no longer hurts.

                                                I got the 2nd moderna vaccine on Wednesday, April 21st. With the shivers in the evening. Couldn?t sleep due to a fever. Had body aches the next day and felt light headed. Went bed that evening and slept a good 10 hours. So by Friday felt 90% still some stiffness, but felt good to go. Later in the afternoon and early evening I noticed a rash from the face down to the pelvic emerge. It is gone in the morning.  Hearing from a relative that got the Johnson and Johnson they also got the rash, but no other side effect.

                                                I had pain on my left arm where I got the shot and I experienced fever, headache, and tiredness. The fever started 12 hours after I got my shot, and my body temperature was at high as 101.9 F.  I didn&#39;t take any medicine, but drank water and took rests frequently. In about 36 hours after I got my shot, almost all the symptoms disappeared.

Rash developed shortly after that, followed by hives and blisters similar to shingles.

                                                I had 3 stages of reactions to the first dose. 1. Same day of the vaccine, I had a mild soreness in my arm which was normal for a vaccine shot. Nothing out of the ordinary. 2. Second day, I felt tired, similar to what I would feel if I am getting  the flu. I felt as if I had a elevated body temperature, but the forehead thermometer was normal. 3. Third day, I felt better overall, only had the soreness in the arm left. 4. Day 12, I noticed 3 patches of a rash on and around the injection site. I only noticed them because I felt my arm warmer than usual. The texture of the rash is a bit different than my regular skin, mildly reddish in color, 1 patch is 2 inches in diameter, the others are smaller. I called in to vaccination team and the nurse took my statement and directed me to report it here.

The license partner had received the report from FDA VAERS.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of HAEMATOCHEZIA (Haematochezia) in a 31-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Irritable bowel syndrome. Concomitant products included ALBUMIN HUMAN (ALBUTEIN), CLONAZEPAM and MULTIVITAMINS [VITAMINS NOS] for an unknown indication.   On 05-Feb-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 05-Feb-2021, the patient experienced HAEMATOCHEZIA (Haematochezia) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FREQUENT BOWEL MOVEMENTS (Frequent bowel movements), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in extremity), PAIN (Pain), the first episode of CHILLS (Chills), FATIGUE (Fatigue), HEADACHE (Headache) and INJECTION SITE PAIN (Injection site pain). On an unknown date, the patient experienced the second episode of CHILLS (Chills) and MYALGIA (Body aches). At the time of the report, HAEMATOCHEZIA (Haematochezia), FREQUENT BOWEL MOVEMENTS (Frequent bowel movements), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in extremity), PAIN (Pain), FATIGUE (Fatigue), HEADACHE (Headache) and INJECTION SITE PAIN (Injection site pain) had not resolved and last episode of CHILLS (Chills) and MYALGIA (Body aches) outcome was unknown.

He got the second dose and noticed increased the frequency, made it a little worse after the second dose. They were not so frequent anymore. Patient still have blood in stool at least 2 times a week.  No treatment information was provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  a discrepancy on onset date of PT haematochezia exists in the SD.  Concomitant medical condition could be potentially confounder for the events; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  a discrepancy on onset date of PT haematochezia exists in the SD.

                                                Started with itching and by day four after the injection I had a severe trunkal rash - started around my neck and moved south eventually covering all around my neck, chest , abdomen and down both legs and both armpits; red raised rash that blistered in some spots.  One of my colleagues (a surgeon) looked and me and prescribed. Treatment was antihistamine and steroid DosePac . The rash may have improved with  the treatment; however, the blisters took awhile to heal and I&#39;m still itchy. Swings in temperature  -in the room, or in the water or anywhere it swings - the itching gets worse. I crawl up my skin for the itching. I&#39;ve tried cremes and calamine lotion and oatmeal baths.

When I try to use it, it caused mild pain. After waking up, my left arm deltoid muscle was visibly swollen and has a medium amount of pain and significantly decreased range of motion. Because this event has not yet resolved, I may seek advice from my primary care doctor later today

                                                One week after my first Moderna dose, I noticed an enflamed reaction at the injection site. There is mild itching and a red area about 2.5 inches in diameter. I did not notice this reaction in the days immediately following the shot. I did, as expected, experience moderate soreness in my left arm for 2-3 days. Is it recommended to receive the second dose in the opposite arm?

Responded to Benadryl and Zyrtec. 24 hours later I broke out again in hives all over my arms and legs and Benadryl and Zyrtec once again relieved the symptoms. 24 hours later I again broke out in hives, which responded to Benadryl. I have no allergies and have never had an allergic reaction in my life. I have eaten nothing new nor been exposed to anything new - my routine has been the same since before the vaccine.  I did not have an allergic reaction immediately following the vaccine. The reaction is only cutaneous with no difficulty breathing but has happened for 3 days in a row.

EMS reports that his vaccine was administered at approximately 1530 and after 10-20 minutes of injection, patient experienced shortness of breath, chest tightness, and throat swelling with associated itchiness. Patient was given 0.3 epi IM and within 10 minutes of administration, patient&#39;s symptoms were mostly resolved. Patient states that he had bilateral rashes to his arms. EMS notes that patient did have an abnormal EKG en route to the ER but suspects it could be a possible cardiac artifact. Denies any daily medications.

Blood test showed that I am suddenly highly allergic to 19 different food groups. I have no known food allergies prior to C19 Moderna Vaccine. I have had hives every single day since they 1st appeared (3.5 days after vaccine). I have had multiple days of facial swelling as well and have been to the hospital multiple times. To this date (date of this report) I still have hives and facial swelling. Facial swelling is intermittent. I have stayed away from the list of foods that I am apparently suddenly allergic to and I still have hives and swelling. I occasionally have a irritated throat which makes it difficult to breathe in. I have a specialist appointment with an allergy/immunology doctor this coming Thursday to see what thier diagnosis is. My family doctor believes my potential angioedema diagnosis is directly related to my 1st dose of C19 Moderna Vaccine.

                                                Received 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/20. Besides general left arm soreness for 2-3 days following vaccine, I had no other symptoms until Sunday January 3rd, at which time I began to notice increased fatigue, chills, and mild cough. Symptoms did not subside by Monday morning, January 4th, and I called in sick to work and requested that I receive a Covid 19 test from an urgent care. I tested positive for Covid 19 that day, and remained off work until 1/14/21. I experienced moderate chills, moderate increased skin sensitivity, and significant fatigue from 1/3/21 to 1/8/21, sleeping ~16-20 hours per day every day during that time. I began feeling better 1/9/21 and symptoms gradually improved until I was symptom-free on 1/12/21. I returned to work on 1/14/21, &gt;10 days following initial symptoms.

I went to the hospital because I felt I was going to throw up and I had to hold on to my stomach, felt a stabbing sensation to my stomach and the pain was unbearable. They performed an ultrasound of the abdomen and a CT scan of the abdomen. I also had an endoscopy performed after my 2nd vaccine. I had a biopsy of my stomach and I am pending results.

                                                Patient developed pain radiating up into the right side of his scalp starting about two weeks after the injection which was in the right deltoid. . The pain then progressed to the right neck and supraclavicular area. He felt throbbing , sore, numbness as well and &#34;shocks&#34;. Over the next view days the pain was shooting down his triceps and numbness and tingling and then numbness in the fourth and fifth fingers. No muscle weakness and no fever or chills. No systemic symptoms. He complained of the tingling numbness and a sense of swelling--all down the right arm in the c6-7 distribution. On April first his wife noted a vesicular rash on the right side of his neck with a few lesions on the right upper back. He was not responding to NSAIDs, ice or heat, immobilization, so at this point the clinical diagnosis of shingles/varicella zoster was made and Valtrex 1000 mg tid was started.

I&#39;ve experienced the hives/rash on my back, stomach, armpits, legs, butt, and arms. I am continuing to randomly break out in hives. They are itchy and usually last about 20 minutes and then go away and come back later. I was hoping the hives would just go away on their own, but I have now been experiencing them for over a month.

I can typically wrap my hand around my feet easily (i.e., touch my toes).  However, I had leg tightness so strong I could barely make it to my shins.   I went to work. Had chills, malaise,  pain at the injection site, and continued intense leg pain until I took an acetaminophen (500mg) at 2:00 p.m. on April 9.   Hip and butt tightness continued for the rest of April 9 and through part of April 10.   Redness and pain at the injection site continued until April 12.

                                                Within a couple hours of the shot, I developed arm pain at the site of injection. Headache onset was around 7-9pm and initially mild. Pain grew through the night. Headache became a migraine sometime between 4-6am. By 10am the pain was among the worst I?ve felt. Developed low grade fever around this time (about 100.8 F). I took 2 regular strength OTC tablets of Tylenol sometime between 10am and 12pm.  The head pain only lessened a little in severity. Sometime around 3pm the migraine dissipated rapidly. For the following 24 hours, I had no pain but felt lethargic.

He is also experiencing numbness and tingling down that arm. The injection site is clearly in the center of the deltoid, and not too high. Today he started experiencing blurred/halo vision, as well as quite a lot of dizziness.  He also said he was experiencing tightness in his jaw. We sent him home from work today. He was going to lay down.

My right cheekbone is also sensitive to touch. I have no physical rash or reaction on my skin. It?s all nerve feeling. The right side of my upper chest feels more tight than normal. With my history of spontaneous pneumothoraxes I usually have a good feeling on my lungs and chest. This feels tighter than normal and came on about 12 hours post vaccine shot. Otherwise I feel much better today than yesterday. This nerve feeling is still there however.

                                                Urticaria on the wrists developed approximately 10 days after first vaccination. It continued to increase in severeity and spread throughout my body over the following 2 weeks.  Severe urticaria developed on my torso, arms, feet, and legs after the second vaccine dose and has persisted in severity.

                                                First shot (on 03/27/2021 at 12:30 PM) resulted in fatigue and pain/soreness at injection site.  Fatigue started within 1 hour of injection but was only on 03/27/2021 and did not return in subsequent days.  Pain/soreness at injection site started within 1 hour of injection but was steadily decreasing until gone on 03/30/2021.  Second shot (on 04/24/2021 at 12:00 PM) resulted in fatigue, pain/soreness at injection site, and moderate flu-like symptoms.  Fatigue started within 1 hour of injection and was gone by 5:00 PM 04/25/2021.  Pain/soreness at injection site started within 1 hour of injection and lasted until 04/28/2021 (steadily decreasing each day since injection).  Flu-like symptoms started in the evening of 04/24/2021 and peaked at 9 AM (wake-up time) on 04/25/2021 until 5 PM 04/25/2021.  Flu-like symptoms included muscle pain, chills, elevated temperature (did not break 100 degrees), headache, fatigue, and general malaise.  These symptoms peaked in intensity around 1PM on 04/25/2021.  1000mg Tylenol taken at 9PM and 3PM seemed to help with symptoms.  Fell asleep at 3:30 PM and woke at 5PM with virtually no feeling of symptoms (other than pain/soreness at injection site).

He showed photos of his arm with a circle around what appeared to be an injection in the front part of the deltoid muscle area. Patient related that he visited FNP (noted in this report) for evaluation within a few days of the shot. Per patient history, he declined imaging or other scans and elected to treat symptomatically using Naproxen. Per patient, symptoms subsided after a couple of weeks to the point range of motion generally returned but soreness remains. Patient desired to receive his second dose to complete series which was administered.

                                                Moderna EUA - Patient who is nonverbal and  received his second COVID vaccine today reportedly developed evidence of discomfort by closing his eyes, gritting his teeth and trying to lay down within 15 minutes of his injection.  This had not occurred w/ his first injection on 4/19/2021.   A medical assistant reported seeing distended right neck and right arm veins, and his family member reported seeing urticaria.  Vitals per MA were bp 97/59, pulse 102, pulse ox 96% on room air.  Upon my arrival, there were no visible distended neck or arm veins, and patient was seated comfortably, upright in the backseat of his family member&#39;s vehicle.  There were horizontal linear indentations across his right neck, as though he had been resting his head against the back of his seat, or a seat belt may have been rubbing on it (but seat belt would have been on wrong side).  He was in no respiratory distress.  There were no visible urticaria.  BP was 115/69, pulse 92.  Lungs were clear to auscultation and cardiovascular exam revealed mild tachycardia, regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  He had received 10 mg of Benadryl through his G tube just as I arrived.    I recommended that patient be observed for 15 more minutes and patient went home without further incident, to go to ER if developed respiratory distress.

I followed up the following day, he stated that reaction resolved completely within five hours.

Hours later the tingling in my face was still there a stronger. My face around my mouth felt numb. Not sure if lips were a little swollen or just numb. My face also felt dried out. The next morning i woke up and numbness and tingling have gone away. My face still feels dried out.

During the first 24 hours of receiving the vaccine I felt fatigue, aches and sickness, but it went away after 24-28 hours. However on the third day, that is when I had a possible hsv outbreak.   I looked online to discover that other people have also had outbreaks within a week of getting the Moderna second dose vaccine.

(not sure if this was a side effect or just a shock response to foreign matterials entering the body)  localized soreness in arm for a few days. worse second day than first.  chemical taste in mouth resembling isopropyl alcohol for about an hour or so, starting about 30 minutes after recieving vaccine, i assume this was just some of the sterilizing agent entering the body and getting circulated.  mild head fog in the days following the shot, this seems to have mostly gone away and i cant say with certainty if it is a side effect or was caused by some other factor such as stress.  mood disturbance / depression starting the day of the shot, this one might be completely unrelated, I attended a funeral of a family friend on that day which seems a reasonably likely cause for such, im just listing it because I want to be concise with my reporting of what Ive been experiencing.  mild headache behind the temple on the right side of my head, and behind both eyes.  heightened reaction to concrete allergy, not sure what exactly in concrete/cement i am allegric too possible nickel or chromates as pomphlox seems to fit the description, this has been recurrent for years but after recieving the vaccine a ring of hives formed on my left hand and my feet were the most broken out theyve ever been, i worked with cement 1 day after recieving the shot.  a relatively consistent feeling of coldness, since getting the shot ive felt abnormally cold, sometimes feeling the need for wearing a coat in 80&#43; degree weather. this is completely abnormal, typically i could wear a tshirt in 50°F weather and a hooded sweatshirt would suffice down into the 20s.  persistent joint pain in almost every joint of my body and the surrounding muscles, feels like it may be in the cartilidge or connective tissue, occasional pains had been experienced before and considered a normal part of life, but this has been relatively constant like an inflammatory response.  sleep cycle disturbance, normally i had abnormal sleeping habbits where being awake for 24&#43; hours at a time wasnt particularly uncommon (oddly this one seemingly gets worse when i stop drinking caffinated drinks), and it was impossible for me to get to sleep prior to like 2-3 am most nights followed by  sleeping for around 4-10 hours a night on average. however since recieving the shot ive been sleeping a lot more than this and at strange times (for me) like the middle of the afternoon.  fever/constant headache on the side the injection was recieved on has set in after about 2weeks and has been terrible, ive had to take ibuprophen for two days just to function, mild visual hallucinations have also occured in the past couple days mostly spatial distortions where the depth perception isnt working properly, and framerate issues where objects in motion leave a trail momentarily.

                                                Within the next three days i had a high fever of 102f, soreness at the injection site. On the second dose (on 4/28/21) I had that and shivering, sweating, fatigue, body aches that lasted about 1 day after they started and were gone by the third morning after getting the second shot.  Since the second vaccine and ongoing I have developed a heavy mucus buildup and need to clear my throat often, periodically (perhaps once a week for a couple hours) I cough up grey/green sputum. No other symptoms are present as far as I can tell and I am not running any fever. I have scheduled a virtual appointment with my primary care provider later today.

I?ve had no appetite and have lost about 5 lbs in 2 days from not eating.  I have dizziness as well but it is not severe enough that I cannot walk on my own. I have injection site redness as well. I am reporting these symptoms on the third day after my shot and I have improved but only slightly.

Continued to get worse throughout day until rubbed skin raw. Went to urgent care, steroid shot and started coarse of steroids day three AM. Chest was tight and prescribed inhaler. Would need to use multiple times a day and several through night. Day 6: Went back to urgent care. Highest dose of steroids. Didn?t help. Day 7 went to allergist, gave me different dose of allergy medicine and to take acid controller to help with itching. Helped slightly. Continued to be itchy through steroids and was not only on highest dose but longest period possible. Skin reacts to just about anything it touches.  While not itchy, uncomfortable she still happens to this day almost 2 months later. Allergist is convinced it is a result of the vaccine. Breathing is better but I had significant trouble for first 10 days.

Heaviest activity is on my arms, legs, and torso.  These hives come and go, though never truly disappear.  They continue today, 4 months after vaccination.  I have sought treatment at primary care physicians, dermatologists, and now finally have an allergist who is helping to treat using Xolair to try and bring the urticaria under control.  Benadryl, Hydroxyzine, Singulair, and creams were all tried but did not work.

It started with abdominal pain and the next day I had a fever.  I went to the ER it was discovered that I had elevated Liver Function tests and Eosinophilia.  There was Bilirubin in my Urine.  I was discharged the next day. The fever persisted and I returned to the ER. My levels were much worse and my Eosinophil levels were climbing. I also developed a rash on my hands and feet. After extensive testing nothing definitive was found. I have not had any problems like this before.

Evaluated 6/2 in hospital with fevers and dark urine, found to have elevated LFTs including bilis.  Ultimately rehospitalized 6/6-6/13 for FUO, jaundice, transaminitis, fatigue.  Also had conjunctivitis.  No heart/lung issues. Had eosinophilia to 1000s. Ultimately required liver biopsy which showed hepatic congestion as if had cholangitis (but did not) and eosinophils.  Ultimately discharged when LFTs and CBC stabilized.

                                                About three or four days after I got the vaccine I just got really extreme pain on my upper back near my shoulder blades and upper neck. It just came out of nowhere and its kind of been ongoing since. I started developing a rash as well.  My doctor had me come in immediately to make sure I didn&#39;t have meningitis. They gave me muscle relaxers and referred me to physical therapy.  It kind of went away but I&#39;ve been dealing with a lot of upper back pain since the vaccine. I&#39;m pretty active and walk about 13,000 steps a day. I wasn&#39;t being very active at all around that time. A couple of days after the vaccine I had sleep paralysis and couldn&#39;t get out of bed. That&#39;s when I developed the back pain around time.

Rash disappears after 3 hours, I guess. One instance happened after I applied a sunscreen before sun exposure- a hives reaction appeared where i applied the sunscreen product, arms, legs, head, neck, and shoulders.

Experience flu-like symptoms over the weekend but said those have mostly resolved as of today but noticed red, splotchy areas on his arm that resemble a rash but do not itch and that it just appeared today as far as he knows. Pt stated it is not at the injection site but near it and also on his bicep. Advised pt to have a physician examine him to ensure there are no complications and to follow-up with us as well.

                                                I had a little swelling at injection site on day of and night of. The following day the swelling increased and had spread to the armpit area. It was more tender and there was moderate to sever pain in the armpit. I took some advil with minimal relief. On the 3rd day (today) the swelling seemed a littlw worse and the pain increased slightly. I contacted my plastic surgeon (since back in October 2019) because i had a procedure called miradry, which elemintes the sweat glands in my bilateral armpits. The doctor advised me to come in immeidately to the office. Upon arrival the doctor examined the area and was able to se immiedalty that is was swollen. I consented to pictures being taken. He is making an entry as well as I am and I was advised to ice the area and to take advil and to remain in contact.

At about 1030AM I had a very bad headache and was extremely nauseous for about 3 hours and felt like vomiting but did not vomit. This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

Rash is red, raised, hive-like and itches/burns mildly. Overall reaction moderate in severity and appearance. No anaphylaxis experienced.

Rash is warm to the touch and itchy. Have experienced elevated temperatures at night but unsure if this is due to a reaction of the shot.

                                                Two or three days after the injection, I noticed 3 small blisters at or near the injection side on my left upper arm. There was also some pain and tenderness more or less like the feeling of having a bruise in that area. Those blisters popped a day or two later and I did not notice anything further until 1/21/2021 when I noticed a large red patch on my left upper arm near the injection side. The bruised feeling remained until today. As of the time of writing (1/23/21 4:30pm) the redness has subsided partially but it still visible, and the bruised feeling has almost completely gone away. I visited an urgent care today and the onsite doctor informed me that it was likely a skin reaction to the vaccine and not a skin infection relating to the popped blister.

The next morning, 1/31, I noticed the area around the injection site was red, warm to the touch, and hurt when pressure was applied. The next morning, 2/1, the size of the red area increased slightly and it was still warm and hurt when pressure was applied. This afternoon, 2/1, I&#39;m noticing feeling warmer and sweating more than usual. I&#39;m not sure if that is related but I don&#39;t have another explanation for it.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  About 7-8 days after receiving 1 dose of vaccine, area around injection site became swollen and hot with a light pinkness to my skin color. The following 3 days the area has continued to grow larger in diameter, turning a deeper red, continued swelling and heat.  Does not bother me very much overall, other than the concern that it continues to grow.

States redness grew, more muscle pain, more swelling, darker red in color, generalized arm swelling and tingling in hands. No systemic symptoms: fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath: just localized to that area.  - drainage, redness, warmth to touch. Start taking zyrtec twice daily for any allergic reaction.  No need for steroids- swelling improving, declines any other systemic symptoms. Discussed topical- not interested.  Advised if having worsening- red, hot to touch, fever, chills, drainage from site, streaking redness let us know and will start on antibiotics- declines at this time.

                                                On 2/6/2021, beginning at around 6 p.m., I started experiencing a very severe headache. The headache became progressively worse between 6 p.m. and around 2 a.m. that night. It was one of the worst headaches I have ever experienced. The headache felt like &#34;pressure&#34; around my head - it was not concentrated in a single spot. It seemed to be slightly worse when lying down. I was alarmed at the strength of the headache, and how long the headache lasted. I considered going to the hospital but decided not to. I took two Advil, which did not resolve the headache, but did make it slightly less terrible. I was able to get some sleep, and when I woke up the next morning, I still had a headache (albeit not quite as bad). As of today, 2/10/2021, I still have a slight headache--I have had a headache every single day since 2/6/2021. My current headache is not nearly as bad as the headache on 2/6/2021, but it&#39;s still a headache. I experienced the other vaccine symptoms that others have reported (fever, chills, sweating, significant pain at the injection site, etc.), but I was surprised to experience one of the worst and longest-lasting headaches of my life. I am concerned about taking the next dose in a few weeks.

I went home took some Tylenol and laid down for about 2-3 hours and the heart rate went down to normal but the dizziness and Lightheadedness continued until the following day and that when I my right arm started to hurt around the injection site. Some Tylenol and massaging the muscle pretty much took away the pain.

It went away with no treatment in about 48 hours. I know that is not one of the common side effects and it occurred long after the shot, so I wanted to report it in case anyone else does as well. Of course, it may have been caused by something else, but I have never in my life had anything similar occur; nor had taken any new medications or eaten new foods.

                                                I began having hive flare ups during the night of the event start date. It looked and felt like mosquito bites located on both of my elbows and scattered throughout my upper body. The following day I began to develop more hives that varied from small to large that were extremely itchy during the day and painful during the night. The hives continued to spread the following day and I visited my physician who prescribed several antihistamines. I have been taking those for seven days and although I still have the hives, they are starting to fade away for the most part.

Has been tender since receiving vaccine on Friday afternoon. Took ibuprofen on Sat for the pain and did help some. Nothing since then. Not bothering  much. Noticed the redness around the site last night after taking off his shirt, so sometime between morning and evening it developed. He called to notify us this morning about reaction. Instructed him to see Dr or call RN if further concerns arise. RN will follow up with him in 1 week to see how he&#39;s recovering. Reminded to go to VSAFE website/app as well. Told him RN would report to VAERS.

                                                I received the shot in my left arm. Two things happened upon injection (1) I immediately began to bleed from the injection site. I have been told the provider may have hit a capillary; it bled for about 45 seconds. (2) within 20 seconds of injection I felt faint and began to sweat; this was rather short and subsided within 2-3 minutes. I was concerned that because I began to bleed immediately after injection that the vaccine may have also been expelled, too. But given the following reaction just described and the soreness I continue to feel in my arm, I assume the vaccine was successfully injected. The shot provider was surprised at the bleeding, as was I, but unsure of the exact reasoning behind it.

                                                Approximated one week after administration the injection area became very itchy.  Upon briefly itching it and then inspecting it because it felt very warm I have a perfect rectangle raised above my skin.  The color is dark red / slightly bruised.  The area is warm to the touch.  There feels to be a knot underneath the injection site that is relatively large in comparison to the raised / welted rectangle.  The itch subsided after a few hours but it is still raised and warm to the touch.  It is now hour 14 after recognizing the reaction.  The area was painful in the days following administration of the vaccine, and I avoided touching or inspecting it at that point as it was reported to me to be normal to experience pain at the injection site.

                                                Two minutes post-vaccination, mother noticed redness on patient&#39;s neck, and &#34;side vein slightly bulging&#34;. Five minutes after vaccination, mother noticed the patient was pale on forehead, followed by &#34;overall paleness&#34; a minute later. Patient reports feeling slightly light-headed five minutes post-vaccination. He said he also felt warm and slightly sweaty. Eight minutes post-vaccination, his mother said his earlobe &#34;lost color&#34;. The patient reported feeling cool and sweaty around this time and still light-headed. 19 minutes post vaccination (at 10:06 AM), patient informed me of how he was feeling, and I checked his blood pressure. It was 93/47, with a pulse of 55. He felt very hot to the touch, but his temp was 96.8 degrees. He brought a water bottle to sip water as needed, and he was given a cool cloth for his neck/forehead. At 10:10 AM, patient reported feeling weak and didn&#39;t want to talk. At 10:13 AM (~25 min post vaccination), patient reported feeling a &#34;bit better&#34;, and his BP was 104/57 (checked by other RPh). 34 minutes post-vaccination he reported feeling much better and was much less light-headed/able to talk. At 10:26 AM (~39 min post-vaccination), BP was 137/75, and his pulse was 60. 42 minutes post-vaccination, he said he was &#34;mostly back to normal; ~90%&#34;. Then, 46 minutes post-vaccination, he said he was 95% better, and he said he was &#34;good to go&#34; 51 minutes post-vaccination.

His face/lips were pale and after a few minutes of sitting on the floor he felt good enough to get up and sit back on the chair. I gave him a cold bottle of water. He was able to drink the water. It was hard to get specifically what the patient was feeling or experiencing because he did not speak English and also was mentally challenged. The paramedics were called and when they came they took the patient&#39;s blood pressure and pulse ox and everything was normal. After about 15-20 minutes they helped him to the car to make sure he was feeling better. We called later in the afternoon to see how he was doing and the sister said he was doing much better.

                                                Almost exactly 1 week after getting the first Moderna shot, I woke up and had hives on my lower arms and hands. The next day it spread to my feet, ankles and knees. The next day it was on my thighs, arm pits and groin. The fourth and fifth days it didnt seem to spread anymore, but it was quite uncomfortable. Avoided alcohol and sunlight/heat as much as possible, but I do work in a hot warehouse. Very itchy. One spot on my foot &#34;broke open&#34; and was stuck on my sock, but soaking in luke-warm/cold oatmeal bath helped a lot overall. I did not start taking Benadryl until the third day, I believe. Benadryl seemed to really help after a couple of days. I am a smoker, but no respiratory problems. It is now 13 days after the dose and they are still lingering, but just as a red rash/spots. I have had an abnormally large amount of stress the past few weeks, as I am sure that has been adding to it. From what I&#39;ve seen online, it is almost like shingles. I do not have a PCP in Indianapolis, so I have not seen anyone about it. The strangest part is that they are almost a mirror image on my body. Every one of the spots is practically identical on either side.

                                                I woke up the morning after my second dose experiencing  the common symptoms related to the vaccine -- persistent headache, body ache, fever, cold shivers, and fatigue. These symptoms lasted for approximately 24 hours, and I continued to have a headache for a total of approximately 48 hours.   However, I then developed pain in my left calf approximately 10 days after the second dose and on three consecutive evenings at approximately 9pm I developed an all-body itchy rash (big red raised welts) that would disappear by the time I woke up the next morning. The rash only occurred on these three evenings, but the pain in my calf persisted. I went to see my primary care doctor the following Monday (05/17/21) who gave me a referral for an ultrasound to rule out a DVT, although he said that it was not urgent that I go as I didn&#39;t have the other regular symptoms of a DVT (swelling, redness, warm to the touch) and I was too young and healthy to be at risk for one. My doctor said that if the pain didn&#39;t subside by the end of the week I should go for the ultrasound. The pain got worse and so I went for an ultrasound on Saturday (05/22/2021). I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH A BLOOD CLOT (DVT), and sent to the emergency department.

                                                I had dry, itchy skin all over.  If I touch any area, it will itch and get a rash.  If I touch another part, it will do the same.  I went to my doctors about it.  She told me to try Benadryl.  I try over-the-concern medicine cream and aloe.  Nothing is helping.  The rashes are light, and they do fade away if I do not touch them.  It still does itch. I also had a couple of headaches as well.

                                                For several hours I had no side effects, including soreness at the injection site. In the evening, maybe 6-8 hours after the injection, the site became sore. After midnight, I started having severe chills and needed several layers of clothing and blankets to stay warm. I checked for a fever and did not have one. In the morning the chills were gone but I had a strong headache that lingered with varying intensity throughout the day. It is unclear if the headache was more from the vaccine or more from a lack of sufficient sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep with the chills. The injection site has continued to be sore and seems to be increasingly sore. After waking up on 1-13-2021, I found myself feeling fatigued and lethargic, not dissimilar to the fatigue I felt when I had COVID. The fatigue has somewhat subsided over the course of the day, with lots of rest helping. The headache and soreness are ongoing, and the fatigue is present but less than earlier today. There&#39;s been somewhat of an ongoing lack of appetite, but I&#39;ve been able to eat in small amounts and keep down what I eat. The chills have come and gone a couple times throughout the day today, but that doesn&#39;t seem to last long.

At the time, I was a few months into treating allergies with sublingual drops. After one week of continued hives, I stopped the drops per the request from the allergy clinic. I got the second vaccine on 1/25 and continue to get very itchy hives. Discontinuing allergy drops and taking Benadryl don?t seem to help.

                                                The day after my vaccination, on 2/4/21, I started having headache followed by fever and chills in the afternoon and throughout the night till the early morning on 2/5/21 when the fever, chills and the headache are all gone.  However, the site of the injection on my left arm has turned red. I would say it is a red circle with a radius of 1.5-inch around the injection location. It is painful when pressed on. Also my left armpit (lymph nod) is swollen and is painful. Hopefully I won&#39;t die :/

                                                Delayed reaction to the vaccine that began 6 days after first dose and persisted for approximately 3 days. I first became itchy on my abdomen and arms, I then developed flat oval hives and my eyes and upper lip began swelling. My throat did not swell. I took 2 Benadryl that evening that helped the itch and caused the facial swelling to subside somewhat. I slept thru the night and when the Benadryl wore off in the morning, the same symptoms returned. I took 1 Benadryl which again calmed the symptoms. The same symptoms returned in the evening and I went to an Urgent Care. I was prescribed Prednisone and more Benadryl. These medicines helped to calm the symptoms even more, but the itchiness and hives did come and go thru the next day. On day 3 I took Zyrtec in addition to my last dose of Predisone and the itchiness subsided completely. I took one more dose of Zyrtec the next day and the symptoms have not returned. I followed up with my PCM who tested for a Hazelnut allergy as I had eaten them that first night. She also referred me to an Allergist. I saw the Allergist who said in their opinion my immune system was having a reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and classified me as &#34;medium risk&#34; for the second dose. He recommended that I still get the second dose and to premeditate with Zyrtec the night before, day of and for 7 days following.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

Over the course of the night, I fell more ill and finally took my temperature in the morning around 7 AM and had a fever of around 100.4 F. I took Tylenol about every 6 hours for the next 24 hours with my temperature fluctuating between normal and 100.4 F. During this time, I was too ill to do anything more than sleep or lay in bed. The following day, my temperature broke, but I was still experiencing aches, chills, and brain fog, along with the pain at the injection site. After about 84 hours from the time of the vaccination, I felt normal enough to resume my daily activities.

                                                I had noticed a minimal pain in my pec, but then a pump or DOMS sensation, almost minimal grade strain, thought nothing of it, just &#34;that&#39;s odd&#34;.  Then last night 3/10/2021 I felt a nerve time pain in my axillary space.  I know nerves can be &#34;funny&#34; at times since understanding pain science and low grade nerve information and still didn&#39;t think that was odd.  Today this morning 3/11/201 during my 545am work out I noticed around 6:15 am my delt (injection site) was very red.  Later it got itchy, and now 8:14pm swollen and starting to get warm, and the redness ring is now twice the size of my morning work out.  Pain is minimal none, just minor sorness (a 1/4th of the after day sorness from shot).  My pec area feels off.

On Day 11, it appeared gone, On Day 12, the rash *re-appeared* but had grown in size. On Day 13, the rash was even bigger - had spread further down my arm. By Day 14, it had almost disppeared.  On Day 5, I noticed a swollen lymph node near my left clavicle. On Day 6, this lymph node had swelled and now there was pain. I also experienced slight discomfort under my left armpit. The pain associated with the clavicle lymph node lasted until Day 8. As of Day 14, the lymph node is still swollen.

Second, 7 days after vaccination, itchy and hot area of hives developed around the injection spot and slowly grew  into a 6 inch circle. Third, at the same time with the second symptom, I am having a mild sciatic pain in my right leg.  Symptom 1 has subsided, and symptoms 2 and 3 are still present, but seem to have slowed down.

                                                Swelling or welt under both eyes. Blister-like bumps on swelling when I 1st noticed it, but they have lessened. But the welt is still there, and I feel the swelling more so now than I did last night. It&#39;s now been about 38 hours since receiving vaccine. It doesn&#39;t seem to be getting worse, aside from now being able to feel the swelling. Also, like I said, the blister-like bumps, on the welt/swelled area, have dissipated, so that got better. My face is also breaking out with acne since the shot. I do occasionally get acne break outs tho.

Later on, balloon-type blisters appeared. later majority of that skin peeled off and new pinkish skin surfaced. The entire feeling was like skin burn after boiling oil spill. I could not drive because hand movement or muscle pressure caused pain, leading to unable to sleep on the left side and let people touch my arm. Still, after the new skin, my arm shows many signs of ugly spots and marks and discoloration. It&#39;s mental trauma going through it. Over the period of 15&#43; days applying Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream helped.

Swelling sore is itchy and red, although it is currently hard to tell if the redness is from scratching or inherent to the area.

It was about 4 inches by two inches - a red welt (warm to the touch - raised a little) where I got the injection. It felt very sore. I called my doctor - by the next day, when I had the doctor appt,  the red mark was pretty much not visible. The Doctor could see a little bit of it but it was nothing comparable to the previous day. Doctor told me to monitor it.

                                                Patient was given a timer and asked to stay in the area.  He felt fine, so he walked to the bakery area and spoke with another pt, at the muffins display. He said his arm felt &#34;weird&#34; and said that happened to her, too.  He said he started feeling lightheaded and was leaning against the case.  He said, &#34; I blinked, fell to the ground and next he saw people standing around him.&#34;  He said, no nausea, just lightheaded and he hit the side of his head lightly. Staff helped him into a wheelchair and took him to the office.  I spoke with him in the office and asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital.  I received this information from the patient when I asked him if he could tell me what happened.  He was sweating and pale, but no nausea, no disturbance in his vision and his blood pressure wasn&#39;t elevated.   He told me again that he took no regular medication,  but a couple of years ago he had been dizzy after a tetanus shot.  I asked again if he had any discomfort or pain anywhere and he said only his arm felt sore near the shot.   I asked again if he felt like he would like to go to the hospital and he said no.  His family came and picked him up.

In addition, I developed a rash on my arm and was bedridden. I took a small walk that day and proceeded to swell up on the left side of my body but it subsided within a few hours. The next day, I suffered a stroke due to blot clotting and the clot flowing to my brain. I had to go to the hospital and was there for a few days.

                                                Approximately 1.5 weeks after my initial vaccination for COVID 19, I developed 2 notable side-effects:  1) The site of the objection become slightly swollen, and itchy.  The itchiness was immediately accompanied by a reddening of the skin and a subsequent rash.  The affect was entirely localized to about an inch &#39;around&#39; the site of the injection and did NOT extend to any other part of my arm or body.  2) A shortness of breath developed that -could- be compounded by a pre-existing anxiety condition.  The shortness of breath is NOT a major impediment, and simply manifests itself throughout the past two days (4-17 and 4-18) as becoming easily winded with light activity (walking) and general need to take deeper, more &#39;forced&#39; breaths.

Upon being released from vaccine location while driving an allergic reaction occurred causing swelling of the throat, skin change to red and rash like. I called 911 as I had trouble breathing and an ambulance took me to the hospital and administred epinephrine and benadryl. They called it analphlatic shock or extreme allergic reaction.

Only mildly itchy unless scratched - then they become extremely itchy with burning sensation. Skin issues still present, but discomfort relieved by antihistamine (generic Zyrtec). Ibuprofen/lotion/etc had no effect. I believe it was a delayed vaccine reaction because I?ve never needed antihistamines before in my entire life - no known ?true allergies? (just significant GI issues with eurythromycin, so I avoid it).

Minor ache on injection site with none of the symptoms below) Rash at injection site: Significant slightly elevated  red rash on triceps and deltoid near injection site that lasted from onset at 2:30 ( 14 hours after injection)  until reporting time  4 day. Minor soreness. Condition improving. Fever/Chills/Loss of Appetite: At 2:30 am (14 hours after injection) heart rate went to above 100 BPM (sometime 110-130&#43;)and started to slowly improve to 80 BPM in the morning 8am -- measured using Amazon halo heart rate sensor. While I did not measure temp until 7PM Friday the next day (101.8) during the 1st night I felt very hot and had chills.  Estimate temperature was 103-104. Difficult to sleep (0-2 hours of sleep first night). At 2pm Friday I thought I had recovered but a few hours later I entered another more mild cycle (80-95 bpm). Was able to sleep. I drank two electrolyte (generic Pedialyte from pharmacy) one after injection and the second the next day and was hydrated the full day. I took 1 generic ibuprofen the night of first symptoms at 2:30 am and a second the following night at 11pm.  Aches: Aches were onset on Saturday morning (day 2) in the back neck muscles.

Also very sore at the injection site for about 3 days after shot. I have not been treated for the ear problem.

                                                Delay Skim reaction. I initially only had normal fatigue and achy ness for 24 hrs starting day of vaccine. 9 days later my hands became itchy, irritable, swollen and darker shade of red. It was so irritable I couldn?t sleep and antihistamines, and otc itch creams didn?t provide relief, so I went to a clinic. Prescribed oral and topical steroids. Initially it allowed for itch relief so thought it was great. But next day it comes and go?s in all different spots of my body. It will start itchy then turn red, and could form bubbles on my skin. I apply topical steroid and it will go away about 30 minutes later and show up in another spot. Alternating from hands, formarms, armpits, lower stomach, upper thighs, but can come one and disappear on its own. I?m on my 5th and final day of oral prednisone 50mg a day, and still experiencing this. No other causes could have caused this. Nothing new during this time frame.

                                                After 5 or so days I developed my first outbreak of dyshidrotic eczema.  I?ve had the tiny bumps appear before but this time the itchy sensation was more intense and i itched which made a rash on my hands ,  feet and left elbow develop.  I?ve had it for a number of days now.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

                                                9 days after injection: Developed a rash that was warm to the touch and itching at the injection site. Rash was accompanied by swelling and soreness. The onset was early in the morning when I noticed slight itching and mild soreness. The symptoms slightly worsened, nothing extreme, throughout the day and then stayed steady for a few days. Treated with benadryl and tylenol, which helped. Cleared up in 2 or 3 days.

                                                At about 10 minutes post injection I began feeling dizzy, lightheaded and hot. Left arm began itching. Discovered hives on my upper arm. 15 minutes later hives had spread to my left shoulder and neck. Paramedics on site gave me a fimotadine tablet and a benedryl injection, juice, water and monitored me. 20 minutes later there was no improvement, they gave another benedryl injection. Dizziness persisted. Hives began to resolve. 40 minutes later they permitted me to leave but said I could not drive, because the dizziness persisted. Advised me to take a benedryl tablet by mouth before bed and again in the morning and to follow up with my PCP.

                                                Just over 24 hours after receiving the second Moderna vaccine I started to break out in hives all over my face and neck. 24 hours later my whole body was covered in hives. I was able to finally get the hives to dissipate after taking about 150 mg of Benadryl over a 8 hour period. I went to an Urgent Care the next week when the hives started to come back and the doctor said it was an adverse reaction to the second vaccine. The doctor informed me to keep taking the Benadryl as needed. The hives came back a few days later and one of the doctors I work with told me to start taking an H2 blocker on top of the H1 blocker I was already taking. It worked well. Now a month later I am still getting bad hives all over my body and the H1 and H2 blockers are not working. Heading back to the Urgent care to received better treatment.

                                                Saturday afternoon (2 days after dose) I broke out in extremely bad hives all over my back, face and head. I called ER to see what I should do because this has never happened before. I&#39;ve never had any allergic reaction to anything and I was concerned since I just received my 2nd dose. ER recommended I come in, since nothing in my normal life changed to cause this also because my lips were getting swollen and throat was scratchy. Once I was checked out in ER they gave me an IV with another antihistamine to get in my system faster. I was releases later that night with a script for prednisone (2 pills for 3 days). Everything was fine Sunday however, i woke up Monday with the rash and hives coming back. I then made another appointment with a Dr, who prescribed more prednisone. Hives have since been gone and not returned.

I felt fine and had no adverse after this vaccination until 8:30pm the same day. At this time I started to have sever  itching and within an hour the itching was over my entire body. It was a mixture of hives and regular pruritus/itching and areas of swelling throughout my body. This lasted all through the night into Wednesday, 03-24-21. Around the same time as the itching started Tuesday night, my Spinal joints, Hip joints, shoulder joints, knee joints, wrist and ankles became severely inflamed and very painful. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst pain, at the highest I was at a 9.    On Wednesday, I went in to my Primary Care for the itching and the pain. My PCP is on vacation this week, so I saw his Colleague. Dr. visibly recognized the redness from the itching all over my body, along with the extreme pain to my joints and gave me a thorough examination. After his examination  he spoke to another physician who stepped in and also gave me an exam. Dr. advised the other Dr. and me of  his initial hesitancy  sending me home, wanting me to be observed overnight at the Hospital. After going to their Emergency Room. They gave me the choice but I truly thought it would go away over the course of the usual 24 hours post Vaccination; I also did not want to be exposed to any virus/sickness I might encounter/pick up in the Hospital due to my lowered immune system because of the rheumatoid arthritis injection Humira I take bi-monthly.. I explained that I was living with my mom, and our residence is 7 minutes from the Hospital, Emergency Room.) I assured both Physicians if it got worse, my mother would take me to the ER. So instead of going to Hospital, they prescribed a Hydrocortisone Cream of  2.5% for the itching, kept me on oral Benadryl and told me to stay hydrated. Also, Dr. said if it wasn?t better and/or worse Thursday(03/25/21)to come back in for re-evaluation. Along with the medications for itching, they prescribed a dose of pain medicine: Tylenol(APAP) #4 - or Acetaminophen with 60mg of Codeine.    Yesterday - Thursday(03-25-2021) I was no better, and had to go back in to the Clinic.  I was seen by Dr., who also believed this reaction to be based on the Humira along with my immune system naturally being lowered due to the AS and RA medication. Dr. examined me, as by yesterday my hands/fingers were hurting as well and itching was not any better. He prescribed Atarax (Hydroxyzine) 50mg Cap to be taken 3 times per day for the awful Pruritis, which has caused me to scratch so badly that I?ve had some bleeding from areas on my body, near the larger joints and spine. And also changed the Tylenol #4 to every 4 hours, basically more often for the pain associated.    Adding the Hydroxyzine for the itch along with the Hydrocortisone, pain medication and time since Tuesday?s final vaccine, has helped a bit. Today, Friday, I am feeling less itchy but still having quite a bit of joint pain, but less than Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  Because of the itching and joint/spine pain I received very little sleep until last evening when I was able to rest and not itch or toss and turn from pain. Hopefully on the mend.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after the injection, I awoke with a fever of 101, body aches, and severe headaches.  The symptoms progressed and my fever was over 102 most of the day and hit a max of 103.5 around 2:30pm.  Nausea started around 4pm, which I alleviated by taking Zofran.  I eventually went to bed and awoke on the second day around 4:30am with a fever at 101 still.  Then around 7:30am, the fever broke with the most intense full body sweats.    Later on that Friday, in the afternoon, I noticed a large red rash on my right arm at the injection side, it was slightly swollen and very hot.  It got bigger over the next 12 hours or so and by Sunday afternoon the swelling had subsided and now appears and feels like a sunburn where the redness turns white if you press with a finger and then returns to red and it also itches now.  I treated the itchiness with some hydrocoritizone cream.

This occurred a few min after a warm shower and upon entering bed for sleep. Preceding episode my skin felt sensitive to the touch, to the point it was uncomfortable to use a wash poof during shower. The episode lasted at its highest intensity for 2-3 min, after peak it lasted for 20 min total. I was unable to get up during the peak to grab warm clothing or a blanket. I had no control over my body mobility.

                                                On Friday April 16th, 2021, at around 12:10 AM, I had responded to an email for work that I forgot to respond to in the afternoon because I was receiving my first Moderna vaccine at that time. The email induced a lot of stress and shortly thereafter I felt my chest feeling heavy and started wondering whether I had trouble breathing. It is currently Friday April 16th at 1:32 AM, I woke up my housemate and we took a walk around the block for about 30 minutes and I am feeling better. Since receiving the Moderna injection, the area that received the injection has felt sore.

It went away after an hour. The next day, I was moving around and this time my face, stomach, waist, hands feet, legs,, and back,,went red and was very itchy. Itchiness seemed to start in the palms of my hands first then, moved all over my body. Started seeing bumps raise up on the tops of my hands and stomach. After I stopped moving around it slowly subsided. This has been going on for 4 days. Any time I move around vigorously, seems to trigger the reaction. Latent itchiness all over most of my body after the swelling and redness/bumps go away. Taking Benedryl 2x a day per PCP recommendation. Following up within 4 days if it doesn&#39;t improve.

Arm was sore on the day of the vaccination, and the soreness lasted ~1 day.

From the moment I got it, it felt like my arm was going to fall off.  I got progressively worse throughout evening and woke up at some point last night with chills.  Definitely broke a fever, but it has come back throughout the day.

                                                1h after the vaccination, I had the usual arm pain which lasted for a few days and then completely cleared away (next day I also had fever 37.5-38 C, fatigue, and muscle pain).  However, 8 days after the vaccination, on Friday 30th of April 2021, I woke up in pain: my arm was hurting again and this time I could not find a position on how to keep my arm and not feel pain. I eventually fell asleep but the arm pain at injection site persisted for days. Today (5th of May), five days after the second I still feel some discomfort in the shot area which sometimes goes above the pain threshold.   I did read about people having delayed arm pain, especially with the Moderna vaccine, which is a some kind of delayed antibody reaction. But I did not read about people having both just-after-shot pain and delayed pain and I do not know if I should take the second dose while my arm still hurts from the first does (I have my second shot in 2 weeks). Should I wait for no pain? Should I do it in the other arm? Could you please advise?  Probably nothing, but just to mention everything I know: one contributing factor could be that I went to the gym the previous day of receiving the vaccine and worked my shoulders - I was already a bit sore when I got the vaccine.

                                                at around noon the day following my shot, I started feeling soreness all over my body. I took aleve. I felt some chills and a slight headache. These lasted until Sunday. Monday I started feeling very tired, very week, and still sore in my arms and a little in my legs. I took aleeve. Tuesday I still felt lingering soreness but no headache. I started feeling anxiety towards the end of my workday. At around 4pm I started to feel my legs quivering as if I had just run several miles and my muscles were week. This gave me anxiety as I was still working and assisting clients. at around 4:15 I started feeling like I was going to break out in hives around my neck area, which does sometimes happen to me. I got home and around 7pm I took a Zyrtec, but by that point hives started forming on my neck and head. I felt my lip start to swell. I woke up at about 3am on Wednesday to find both of my lips swollen and I took a Benadryl and went back to bed. I woke up at about 7am and my eyes were both swollen almost completely shut and my lips were swollen. I could feel itchiness from incoming hives around my neck and shoulders. I took two Benadryl and rested all day. The swelling mostly went down by the end of the day and I continued to nurse the Benadryl. I saw my doctor on the 15th. He advised how to proceed and prepare  with the second dose and referred me to an allergist.

                                                Around 4/29/21 healthy male pt developed a rash on right thigh and the right side of chest.  Pt spoke to medical professionals that he works with and was told it was a case of the Shingles.  The rash was getting worse so he started taking Valtrex.  He has only been taking this medication a couple of days so it has not had time to improve his symptoms yet but he feels like the rash is pretty contained at this point.

                                                About 12 hours after the shot I began feeling ill with flu-like symptoms, which is what happened with the first Moderna shot a month earlier. A few hours later, my entire body was throbbing with pain, I was in a cold sweat, my head was aching(it felt like an intense withdrawal) and I was incredibly weak. I stayed totally bedridden for 20 hours, forcing myself to sip water whenever I could muster the strength to sit up. My entire body was red, as though I had a light sunburn. The pain in my body and head was so overwhelming for a short period I considered calling an ambulance, but ultimately rode it out. Most of the pain, redness, and weakness have subsided over a day later, and I am about ninety-five percent back to normal with a very mild head ache.

                                                Around an hour or so after the shot, I had mild face numbness. I noticed this with the first dose as well, but in both cases, it went away. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the onset of a migraine as I get migraines from time to time and I did have headaches/migraines with both doses. Around 12 hours or so after getting the second shot, I had flu-like symptoms (headache, nausea, aches, mild fever). I couldn&#39;t focus and vomited water/stomach bile a couple of times. After around 12 hours of feeling flu-like, I started to feel better and could eat simple food again (Corn Chex, chicken broth). I also had soreness in the arm near the injection site. I can&#39;t remember if I had neck pain or not. After the 12 hours or so of the flu-like symptoms, I quickly recovered. I would have reported this via VAMS, but felt so bad during the first 24 hours after getting the second dose, that I was late to registering my second dose in the VAMS system and the system would not let me retroactively report my symptoms. This is why I am submitting this VAERS report in case that it is helpful.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I felt completely fine, just the regular sore arm. Two days later I thought I was getting bit  by mosquitos because I was experiencing hives, I even had to call the health department to take car of the mosquitos but that wasn&#39;t the case at all, because they were hives and not mosquito bites. I was also receiving heat flashes throughout the night and that is still going on until this day. I was prescribed Prednisone 20mg 3 times a day for four days by my PCP and I did not see any changes for the random hives that I was experiencing throughout the day. Another problem that I have been experiencing was being dizzy at random times as well. I was advised by my PCP to go to the dermatologist to receive an allergy test but haven&#39;t been able to get around too it.

                                                After receiving the first dose I went through the typical symptoms that were mentioned.  I had muscle aches, tiredness, and soreness.  That lasted about a day and was back to normal in two days.  On the 5th day after getting my shot I woke up to extreme pain in my left shoulder (dose 1 injection site).  I could pinpoint exactly where the needle must have gone in, because that area was the most painful.  I had full mobility of the shoulder but moving it would increase the pain substantially.  This extreme pain lasted about two weeks.  It took about a month for the constant pain to go away.  I now experience days where I can feel tightness and light pain in the shoulder at the point of injection.  It is nothing serious and usually goes away overnight.  This occurs at least once every few weeks.

                                                Approximately 1 week after receiving the first Covid dose (in my left arm), I developed a red spot on my (right) arm that did not go away.  To be clear, I do not know whether this has anything to do with the Moderna vaccine but figured I should report it (and also want to be clear that the red spot is in my right arm, whereas the vaccine was in my left arm).  After waiting a few weeks, I visited the doctor a dermatologist.  She did a punch biopsy, which recently returned an &#34;unusual&#34; result.  The lab showed it to multiple people, including a physician with a hematopathology specialty and the Dermatopathology.   Their conclusion was that &#34;overall findings are consistent with a florid hypersensitivity reaction in the appropriate clinical setting.&#34;  However, they also suggest another biopsy if deemed clinically appropriate.

                                                Felt minor pain in arm at first, but it went away. Felt fine for at least two weeks. It&#39;s nearly time for my 2nd shot (coming up this Saturday) and for the past two or three days, my arm has been hurting at the injection site.  Pain was getting severe so I stretched (followed a 5 minute routine from a video), and now it is _very_ painful. Seems to have made it worse. I did the same routine in my other arm, but it feels fine.  The pain is very weird - I have no idea what muscle has the problem. I can lift my left arm above my head without any pain, and I can point it straight in front of me without any pain. I can carry something quite heavy without any pain at all. However, if I lean forward, there is some of the worst pain I have ever felt in my life at my upper forearm where I think I was injected. It has gotten worse the past day, and woke me up from sleep. It&#39;s uncomfortable / nearly impossible for me to lean over to pick something up, even from a table.  I have no bruises nor lumps or bumps from the vaccine though. Honestly I&#39;m really not sure if this is from the vaccine or from something else, but I have not lifted anything heavy (except grocery bags, yesterday), and have not stressed my arm in any weird way that the other arm hasn&#39;t been stressed (from stretching).  Am not sure if I should get the second shot at this point; am considering seeing my doctor, but so far have not contacted him about this. I&#39;m hoping it just goes away on its own.  Must stress that the pain I feel when leaning forward is some of the most intense pain I have ever felt - and I have had both eardrums rupture at once and passed out before. Must also again say that I still am not sure this is from the vaccine and it confuses me if it is because it has been 3 weeks (almost 4?) now since the 1st injection.

I was trying to solve the issue myself with my clinic doctor who knows the entire history of my symptoms, etc. He put me on Zithromax twice daily. That was just one of the many medications he tried. Clinically, on April 22nd, I got a diagnosis, the Hospital ER doctor, Hidradenitis Supertiva; inflammation of the sweat glands, localized in inner thigh and groin region. Extremely uncomfortable, and I&#39;ve never had anything like this before. Even last night, this happened. So much pressure of pus that when it burst last night it shot across the room and hit the wall. Right now, on Topical Hydrocortisone to relieve the incredible amount of itching and every once and a while it drains some cysts. I have complete rundown and records that I can upload for more details. I&#39;ve had massive amounts of steroids and direct injection steroids and the antibiotics that I&#39;ve taken for this.

He only noticed it when going to put on a shirt, as it did not hurt or itch. He said he did vomit one time about 24 hours after receiving the vaccination and felt light headed at that time.

I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

                                                Slight fever of 100.2, nausea (I did vomit), major body aches, migraine, uncontrollable shaking, soreness at the injection site and lack of sleep (due to the pain in my arm and body aching) all from 1/4 to 1/5 early morning. During the daytime hours of the 1/5, took Tylenol (1,000mg) every 5 hours (or so). Also had nausea (as well as had difficulty wanting to eat because I was nauseous), slight fever of 100, headache (no longer a migraine) and major body aches. Stayed home from work and relaxed on my couch (mostly). Today/currently, on 1/6 at 12:50pm, only symptoms I still have is soreness at injection site (not as sever-more of a discomfort) and slight body ache (not as sever). Last does of Tylenol was taken at 01:30am on 1/6.

                                                About 10 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, hives developed on the backs of both of my hands and around my right eye. The hives persisted for 6 days (I took Benadryl to stop the itching). After 6 days of hives I went to a walk-in clinic and they prescribed 5 days of Prednasone. Today I am on my 4th day of the Prednasone and the hives are finally starting to clear up.

Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

                                                A 36-year-old gentleman seen today in consultation for further evaluation of unusual reaction following 1st coronavirus vaccine.  He received Moderna recombinant MRNA vaccine on 12/24.  On about 01/02, he developed a maculopapular pruritic rash that he refers to as hives present over the dorsum of both hands and predominantly right side of the face.  He had some facial swelling.  No breathing difficulties or other symptoms.  He does not recall any rash, aches, fever.  A few days later, he went in to the Community Health Clinic and received some prednisone for this, a 5-day course, and apparently, symptoms resolved by about day 4.  No further problems, but he is wondering if he should receive 2nd vaccine.  Again, no immediate symptoms of any importance following 1st Moderna dose on 12/24.   No clear history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, eczema, bee sting allergy or food hypersensitivity.  No problems with previous vaccines.  He is even wondering if the vaccine and rash reaction are related and this is difficult to prove with any certainty.

                                                Just after getting the vaccine had a sore shoulder for 2 days, then after that nothing until 8 days after getting the vaccine.  On the 26th, started feeling slight soreness in joints in muscles kind of like they were locked up, didnt think much of it, thought it was maybe from overdoing a gym workout.  The next day on the 27th, woke up and was feeling chills, along with mostly full body soreness and feeling very lethargic.  I also had a baseball sized red area on the injection site on my shoulder, it was itchy, swollen and felt very firm to the touch especially compared to other shoulder.  I also had hive like red circular welts on my back, butt, and upper legs.  Two of my fingers had spots on them that felt like blisters.  Felt very sore and tired all day.  In the evening I took 50mg benadryl to try and combat the symptoms.  When I woke up the next morning (28th) still had all the same symptoms just felt slightly better overall.  Took 50mg more benadryl and felt pretty tired and lethargic throughout the day.  In the late afternoon I have started feeling more sore again, and have a slight headache.  The hives and red area on my shoulder are still present but not as red.  So far during this time I have not had any issues with my throat and breathing, but my sternum has been super sore, more sore than any other part of my body during this time.  If i take as much air in as I can, it feels sore and hurts as I get to the last 10% of my lung capacity inhaling.

Arm pain at the sight of the vaccination was severe and was unable to use the arm. Most symptoms subsided 18 hours after vaccination but headache and weakness remained until far into the next day. Approximately of aspirin was taken on day 1 of the vaccination.

Injection site had previously been painful for 3 days after injection but pain had subsided. At day 7 post injection, the injection site became slightly inflamed (puffy) with minor pain that was much less severe than initial injection pain. After 24 hours these symptoms were reduced. At 48 hours symptoms were gone.

                                                After 24 hours right arm was sore, swollen with large amount of redness around injection area, could not raise it above the shoulder. Entire body was weak and fatigued.  48 hours everything seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.  Roughly 80 hours later from the vaccination, suddenly body cramped up and had trouble speaking and pronouncing words. Fell to the ground and had hand spasms similar to bells palsy or cerebral palsy. Could not speak fluently or get up on my own. After 45 minutes to 1 hour, when paramedics were called and came they sat me up. Within a few minutes, like a switch, I could speak normally again and could walk on my own. Walked out to the ambulance and waited for 15 minutes or so, and everything seemed fine and back to &#39;normal&#39;. Declined to go to hospital, and since that episode things are still &#39;normal&#39;.

                                                Fatigue started around 3-4 hours after initial dose and lasted for the rest of the night. Had to lay down because I felt exhausted around 7pm. My arm where the injection site was became incredibly sore to the point where I couldn?t sleep on it at all.  Otherwise I felt decent. I woke up the next day and my arm was about 50% as sore as it was at the peak. I had about 90% energy level so still very slight fatigue. Towards the end of the night the soreness in my arm dropped to about 20% of the peak.

                                                After the pharmacist administered the vaccine the patient started slumping in his chair and stopped talking.  The pharmacist patted his shoulder and said his name to try to get his attention.  The patient&#39;s forearms turned red, and he was breathing heavily but then the pharmacist couldn&#39;t hear his breathing for a couple of seconds, after that the patient took a deep breath and his forearms started turning back to normal color, but his face was very pale.  All took place in less than 2 minutes.  The pharmacist gave him a bottle of water and he waited in the pharmacy for a total of 30-35 minutes.

                                                Rash appeared on my shoulder around the injection site on the 5th. I had been in the sun, thought it could just be that I didn?t apply enough sunscreen.  Didn?t really notice any pain or swelling the 6th, almost forgot about it. Today, the 7th, noticed it itching and tender during work. By the evening a noticeably red, slightly elevated rash had appeared. At this point, now 9:30 pm, it is a puffy, tender, red rash about three inches long and two inches wide. What I imagine is the injection site is about a quarter-inch wide dot near the center.  I applied Neosporin and then read that the internet consensus is that &#34;covid arm&#34; is uncommon but not alarming. Hopefully the medical prognosis as well.

About 1-2 hours after, I began to fever and experience a migraine and intense body aches. During my night, my fever went as high as 102.8F, at which point I took some Tylenol. My fever stayed above 102F for the next 12 hours or so, after which the fever went hovered between 100-101F. The migraines and body aches also persist.

Nothing happened next day or after.   After my second shot on 4/11/21 by afternoon, felt nothing till night before going to bed. Next day waking up by 6:30 am for work, I felt waves of body pain almost head to toes. These were accompanied by chills, later I felt little feverish. I took two Ibuprofen pills twice throughout the day that might have made me feel better which is why I could work. Till I slept I was quite down. Today on 4/13/21 I feel much better. Still bit fatigued but none of the severe pains or chills I went through on 4/12/21. Hopefully I won?t have to go through them anytime anymore.

Bumps itched. Several bumps subsequently grew in size into a noticeable, small rash. Rash/bumps are mostly located in armpits, neck, inside of elbow and other &#34;pit&#34; skin areas. No topical cream or itch relief treatment is effective. Rashes continue to grow slowly in size but greater in number.

The patient began getting lightheaded and hot, his color went out of him and his eyes began rolling back in his head.  His eyelids turned a purple color and he appeared to momentarily stop breathing.  Myself and another pharmacist got him on the ground and supported his head with a coat.  When he &#34;came to&#34; and was talking to us.  He described feeling better on the cold floor and his color began coming back.   I was speaking with him the entire time.  While we were out with his 9-1-1 was called and paramedics arrived 15 min later.  by the time paramedics had arrived the patient had gotten up and back into the chair himself, was lucid and had color back in his face.  Paramedics arrived and took over.  He was given the green light from them and remained in the pharmacy area for a total of about 30 minutes before heading home. The patient was admittedly nervous for the shot and had not eaten or had anything to drink the whole day to that point. I believe he passed out from a variety of factors not related to the actual ingredients in the vaccine but cannot confirm this.

Both went away completely after 2 to 3 days.   Ps. The first number of the vaccine ?lot? number might be a 6. The hand writing is bad.

                                                24 hours after initial injection, a &#34;silver dollar sized&#34; red circular skin discoloration occurred at the site of the shot. 2 days later the edges of the red circle raised and became itchy. I began applying a topical ringworm treatment ( Ointment). During my second dosage appointment when asked if I had a reaction, I showed the nurse my arm and explained what had occurred. She stated that &#34;...it&#39;s probably just ringworm&#34; and proceeded to give me the second dosage (4/7/21). On 4/19/21 I noticed several red and dry spots around my torso. Upon my examination on 4/20/21 I was informed that what I had was not ringworm. I was in fact experiencing Pityriasis Rosea. I have no history of Pityriasis Rosea. I believe the location correlation of the initial shot and the &#34;herald patch&#34; are not coincidental.

Rash is slightly itchy with mild inflammation. Most of the rash is not sensitive to the touch, except for a small patch very close to the injection site. The symptoms do not currently seem to require active management; I am functioning just fine without treating the symptoms.

Patient also stated that his entire face was itching really badly. I had him sit in the chair closest to me and pointed my fan on him. I asked him if he had ever taken Benadryl liquid before, and he stated that he had. I told the patient I was going to give him 10ml  (25mg) of diphenhydramine liquid and he said that was ok. I also noticed that both of his arms had a splotchy rash from his hands up. I asked him if it was like that before I administered the vaccine, and he said no. He took the medicine and said he started feeling better within the next 10 minutes. He said he felt good enough to leave and go on to work. I told him he could stay as long as he needed to, and offered to give him more Benadryl, but he declined. He stated that he has Benadryl in his car because some of the cleaning chemicals at his work make him itch, so he keeps Benadryl in his car.

An hour later I felt it was difficult to catch my breath.  After getting medical attention (benadryl intravenously and fluids intravenously), the next day I had chest pain and continued labored breathing. Two days after the vaccine I still have persisting labored breathing.

Then said he was itching all over his body. Then he said he was itching on his head. Then his opposite side of his arm started hurting him badly. And then he started having black spots forming on his feet. All this is traumatizing his kid. I?m not happy that my son has to worry about his Dad. This sort of traumatizing children should be illegal.  My son never done anything to y?all yet he is getting phone calls traumatizing him about a stupid vaccine everyday.

                                                Shingles; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of HERPES ZOSTER (Shingles) in a 36-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 042B218) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension. Concomitant products included METOPROLOL for Hypertension, VITAMIN D3, VITAMIN B COMPLEX and VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID] for an unknown indication.    On 10-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, the patient experienced HERPES ZOSTER (Shingles) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, HERPES ZOSTER (Shingles) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Three days after the shot on 13-Apr-2021, the patient experienced tenderness and rash on the left armpit and arm that turned to hives and bump the next day on 14-Apr-2021 and blister the day after and on 15-Apr-2021 with some new blisters on his chest. Ten days later on 23-Apr-2021, he was diagnosed with shingles by health care provider and he continued to have itchy blisters and a few extra blisters on his back. He got treatment anti-viral agents, 500mg Famciclovir, Benadryl and Hydrocortisone. He asked if this shot might cause shingles and asked if he could still get his second dose given the anti-viral medications and current conditions.

I saw patient on 3/24/21 after 2nd dose (given to right arm on 3/18/21), and at that time he was complaining of right axillary swelling with some redness as well as persisting left axillary swelling.  Patient had also had other symptoms (fevers, aches, chest discomfort/cough) in the few days after the vaccines that had resolved.  I consulted with our ID specialist, who saw the pt on 4/16/21, and at that time only left axillary fullness was noted.

All symptoms subsided in 28 hours after injection except headache which persisted for about 4 days.  12 days after second dose patient experienced intense pain and redness at site of injection leading to loss of mobility in left arm, and outbreak of hives across torso, upper arms and legs, which have persisted for 5 days (to date of Adverse Event report). Arm pain subsides with 400 mg ibuprofen taken daily. Pharmacist recommended Benadryl for hives, taking 25 mg Diphenhydramine HCI once daily with little improvement in symptoms. Patient recalls no previous history experiencing acute or chronic urticaria. Hives are moderately itchy, mostly painless, and have gradually increased to 2-3 inches in diameter.

No weakness in muscles or drooping face. Came and went. Physical activity such as lifting heavy objects and sleeping on my left side made the symptoms worse.  Numbness lasted for about 2 weeks then went away. I can&#39;t remember exactly when it started, but it was shortly after the first shot. I received the second shot on my right arm from a different pharmacist and didn&#39;t have numbness. The pharmacists believed that the first shot was given too high and may have hit a nerve. Could the vaccine be injected too close to a nerve which could result in aggravated nerves?

Pain is elicited on palpation (no induration felt today) and with certain movements (lifting of arm and abduction).  He relates this specifically to the vaccine administration site.  He said that he had only experienced soreness at the administration sites immediately following the vaccinations until now.  He also has had numbness involving what appears to be the medial nerve (just one time in last week) and strange sensation down at the elbow/AC area.

I was really hungry and ate 3 or 4 bananas. I started to feel uneasy and felt tightness in my chest and pain below the injection site. My heart rate rose into the 100s. Normal RHR= 47-55. I was burping small burps. I was worried and started looking up ERs and contacting family. This event of immense amount tightness and uneasy feeling that lasted about 30-45. Temp was 99.4 then dropped to normal. I thought I was having a heart attack. I called my sister and my symptoms waned. I have had several &#34;cycles&#34; though out the day of feeling very uneasy and slight chest discomfort, but nothing on the level of this morning, or enough to make me go to the ER. It does seem that why I lay down or bend over when sitting down there is discomfort in my chest and I feel uneasy.

An EMT that was at the vaccination site checked my BP and pulse and monitored me and suggested I go home and rest. She said not to take Tylenol unless I absolutely needed it. When I got home I felt absolutely tired and exhausted. By 6:00PM I was developing a low grade fever. I went to the ER at 5/29/2021 at 7:00PM. My temp was 101.5 so I went and got checked out at the ER. The diagnosis was elevated procalcitonin and they ordered a number of labs as well. They also said it was a post vaccination reaction. They gave me about a 1,000 MG of Tylenol and a liter of fluids. I was at the ER for about 3 hours. I also had swelling and rash around the injection site, a raised rash which almost looked like a burn to me it was about 3 inches. I felt tired and weak for about a week to so following this. Another thing that started was vertigo and migraines, but I was suspected of having Covid twice so DRs do not know and it is hard to sat what that is in regards to. I may have had Covid in March 2020 and Feb 2021, I was unable to get tested but the first time it lasted about 6 weeks and the second time was more mild.

He informed me that 2 weeks after his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine dose, he started losing his hair (Symptoms began around March 5th, 2021). Patient presented to my office with 10-15% hair loss in circular discrete patches in his scalp and beard areas. I preformed a punch biopsy of the scalp, which resulted back as Alopecia Areata. The patient was informed of his biopsy results at his suture removal appointment (July 5th, 20201) and he started topical treatments for hair regrowth, and will return in 6 weeks for an injection into his scalp.

                                                Within a few days of my second moderna covid vaccine, the surgical sites from the inguinal hernia surgery I had nearly two years prior started hurting again and feeling irritated. This lasted from nearly two months. I was examined by Dr. (my hernia surgeon) for a re-occurrence of the hernia, but the repairs were in place. After two months, the irritation went away. Nothing else changed in my normal routine, except for receiving the second covid vaccine, so I thought I should report this as an adverse event (possibly an inflammatory response kicked off by the second vaccine?).

On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

I felt strong muscle pain at the injected arm around 12 hours later and woke by the pain multiple times. The next day (1/14/2021),  my left arm is still very painful if I lift it. This strong pain lasted a whole day (1/14/2021) and alleviated quite a lot since 1/15/2021. I&#39;m likely to be one of the reported 90% with musle pain.  2. A mild headache similar to mild cold on the night after the injection. It dimishes next morning. This can be ignored.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

                                                Had pain at the injection site for 2.5 - 3 days only.  After 3 days I observed both my lymph nodes in my armpits were swollen and I felt very fatigued.  No real pain on lymph nodes just swollen.   Lasted for approximately 5 days and returned to normal around January 20th.  I am an athletic 37 year old male.  Had no illness prior.  Had telemedicine appointment with my doctor and he said to report the possible side effects.  Also had blood work up done at his requests to confirm everything was ?normal? with me.

                                                On day 8 after vaccine the injection site started being itchy. It swelled, became red, and was noticeably warm to the touch. Over about 5 hours the redness and swelling had reduced (though not completely). Waking up on day 9 it is still itchy, warm to the touch, and slightly swollen. I have not taken any over the counter medications to counteract the symptoms.

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

I got right on Cepra - Urgent Care visit like I was given for last vaccine. The symptoms subsided after four days.  I am having heart palpitations about two weeks - I notice it a lot - I notice it intermittently but often; Varies in intensity and I was woken up where my heart was beating very loudly - I tried to calm myself down because my heart rate wouldn&#39;t go down. That&#39;s never happened to me before. Even right now I can feel my heart palpate more than I should be able to feel it. Today at 01:00 PM I am going in for an EKG and have my heart monitored. I am gong to clinic where my Dr practices. I saw a PA for a work injury - for worker&#39;s comp from the vaccine -  so I have had an EKG already- result was normal rhythm acutely at the time.

                                                Wife described a putrid metallic odor coming from my body and had an allergic reaction after kissing me. She experienced numbness and tingling on her face and lips as well as hives on her face and neck that was treated with Benadryl.  These symptoms went away after a few hours but she was unable to come in close proximity to me until the next day.  Also experienced, soreness around injection site, body aches, fatigue, flushing of face, headache, light headedness.  All of these symptoms subsided  within approximately 36 hrs. after time of vaccination with plenty of rest.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

Still very painful when I lift etc.   Neck is a lot better  1-19: arm still hurts.  Can?t lift up without pain. Weak to lift other things pain actually seems to be in my shoulder and cracking a lot.  Not in my arm itself.  By the nighttime the pain became more intense in my shoulder and very difficult to lift it or move it.  Like the first day I got the vaccine.  1-20: shoulder hurts worse than ever.  Worst pain ever even if I keep it still has some pain. Horrible.

Arm pain is minor. So long as I don?t touch it it?s fine.   I am tired.  Worn out. Congested.  Left arm and shoulder starting hurting around 2-15?   Once I started working out. Hurt like hell.  800mg Advil helped some but still hurt.  2-26: shoulder left still hurts and tight.  Did not take Advil.   Tried to stretch it.  Feels a little better at 9pm 2-28-21: slight nausea Again.  Still sore arm on and off.  Dried out.  Tired.  Drinking tons of water 3-3.  Last day I worked out and did cardio.  3-5.

I would rate the pain when I pushed on the injection site at 6/10. It was only painful when I touched it or tried to use the muscle to lift my arm in certain ways. I also experienced some level of fatigue and slight dizziness the day after I received my shot.

His SBP was 80 and stated that he does not feel alright. He stated that he does not have preexisting condition but he was afraid of the needle and it was painful when he received the injection.  The nurse called 911 and the pt was taken to ER approximately 40 minutes after receiving the covid vaccine.

                                                Rash, red splotchy and scaly bumps. Beginning on day 5 I had a rash that was mainly consolidated around my torso. Most dense from hip to armpit. For a the next few days it spread to arms, legs and up my neck. The rash never had a forced itch type of feeling but certainly felt itchy yet could will myself to not itch. As mentioned, appears scaly, red and irritated. My wife, doctor contact provided, is a GP and we&#39;ve just been monitoring the rash as she thinks it will resolve itself and looks like some form of Pityriasis rosea although this would a first of that for me.

                                                The side effects I&#39;m experiencing didn&#39;t start until about 2 days later.  It started out as pain at the injection site with extremely bad dizziness that has gotten worse each day. On day 4 after the injection I noticed a full pain in my left thumb area. The same side as the injection. I didn&#39;t think anything of it but as the hour&#39;s and days went by it continued and continues to get worse. The best way I could explain it is it feels like when your hand falls asleep without the pins and needles. Yesterday I ended up having to go to the ER. My issue with my left thumb area started to get much worse. I couldn&#39;t hold things in my left hand and started to radiate up my arm. It was the weirdest feeling I can&#39;t really explain it other than being slightly numb and very week. I wasn&#39;t able to move my hand much at all. They gave me a cat scan but they never called me back to be seen or to give me my results. I was there for 8 hours and was never called back to be seen. I had to leave this morning before I was seen because I didn&#39;t have anyone to watch son. Today is 8 days since I received my first covid shot and I still have major fatigue along with dizziness. I will start sweating profusely out of nowhere and then stops.  I&#39;ve had a numb/metallic taste in my mouth for about 4-5 days as well. I feel like I&#39;m in a complete fog and can&#39;t shake this feeling. I&#39;m having trouble concentrating and remembering things. I&#39;m drinking lots of water and trying to rest when I can but I&#39;m still feeling terrible with no signs of this getting better. My doctor suggested I report this to you and I&#39;m hoping and praying this goes away. Is there anything I can do or a specialist I could see? Thank you so much in advance.

                                                patient was doing well as outpatient with no significant issues post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.  Received 1st Moderna COVID19 vaccine on 2/3/2021.  Developed a rash, biopsy showed lichenoid dermatitis, but no other symptoms after that first shot.  Received 2nd Moderna COVID19 vaccine on 3/12/21 and rash persisted (may or may not have worsened, hard to know from patient report) and the patient presented to medical attention on 3/23/21 acutely short of breath and hypoxic, after being able to exercise (walk 2 miles every other day, etc) prior.  Found to have biopsy proven lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis with diffuse alveolar damage/ARDS requiring supplemental oxygen.  Started on systemic steroids without response.  Also with concurrent mild transaminitis.  From prior recent labs, LFTs were normal prior to presentation with hypoxia.

                                                Around 7 PM on Tuesday, I began to feel fatigued. My abdomen became slightly tender. My arm was sore in the injection site, but that was nothing that I did not expect. As the night went on, I began to feel worse. I developed chills? And became feverish. I did take my temperature and it was 99.5° at one point. I took acetaminophen to help with the fever and bodyaches. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen seem to stem the fever symptoms. The highest my fever has ever been since Tuesday was 100.1°.  When I have a fever I do become congested. So I have not thought anything about congestion as I do develop congestion when I chill. I did develop a muted sense of smell and taste. I can still taste what I am eating and drinking.  My biggest concern is that I would love for my fever to go away. It is making me incredibly fatigued.

The red patch was approximately 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. It felt slightly &#34;funny&#34; (perhaps because the area was slightly raised) but didn&#39;t really itch or cause pain. It slowly faded over time and was completely gone after approximately 8-9 days.

This was approximately 5 minutes after the patient had received his vaccine.  The patient had his eyes closed and reported feeling hot and tingly.  Patient exhibited no signs of rash or respiratory reaction. Patient was given a cold pack for his neck and recovered after a few minutes.  During a follow-up call the next day, the patient reported he had fainted at some point when his eyes were closed.  After leaving the pharmacy, the patient went home and took a nap.  The patient reported no further or lasting effects.

                                                Approximately 3- 5 minutes after felt strange mild sensation as if pins and needles was moving throughout my body from the injection site. I also started to breathe differently. Couldn&#39;t tell if my heart rate changed or not.   At about 5 minutes, I started to feel light-headed and nauseous as if I just had blood taken or an IV in my, likely a drop in blood pressure. I was reading a book, put it down on my lap as I couldn&#39;t focus on reading and considering to get help. At that moment, I passed out, hunched over in my chair staring at the floor.   This moment likely lasted for about 1 minute, but felt like 20. I was in a dream like state and at one point had a series of images and/or memories flash by in a sequence. Then, I felt like I was half asleep but couldn&#39;t tell what I was staring at but knew that I had to &#34;wake up&#34;.   Then , I was surrounded by people who helped me up. At this moment I felt very weak and tired and was sweating profusely. My right hand felt very weak.   About 10 minutes later, I started feeling better. I was given water which seemed to help. I would have waves of mild nausea come and go that eventually subsided. I also felt random cramping around my stomach/lower chest area and lower right side rib cage area.   At about 15 -20 minutes felt confident to walk to the bathroom and throughout the store. Eventually, I felt confident to drive safely home.  At the time of writing this (approx 2 hours later), I&#39;m feeling random sensations/feelings of itchyness throughout my body. No sign of hives.

Next evening at 7:30 went to ER with mild chest pains and blood pressure peaking at 225/104, with a resting heart rate of 100 bpm. EKGs, chest X-ray, and heart enzyme tests confirmed no emergent heart condition. Was released after 3 hours observation when blood pressure dropped to 170/100 without medication. On 4/24/21 my blood pressure was 160/100, so physician prescribed 0.1mg of clonidine to take as needed. Before now I was never prescribed blood pressure medication. Will record my blood pressure for two weeks with a follow up visit on 5/07/21.

                                                6 days after vaccine I developed painful hives along my joints, many on my hands, swollen lymph nodes, swollen tongue, both affecting swallowing, severe burning sensation on my tongue, numerous sores in my mouth including on my gums, and cold sores on my lips. As a result I?m unable to speak or eat. Recommended treatment has been Tylenol, and antihistamine. I?ve been taking probably more than recommended of both, and as of today, all symptoms persist.

                                                I have been experiencing soreness in my back over the past weekend as if I may have pulled a muscle.   Over the last 48 hours I have developed a rash around my torso in where the soreness is located.  After doing some research, I believe I have a case of shingles.  I scheduled an appointment with my doctor for tomorrow to get checked out and receive treatment.   My rash looks just like pictures of shingles that are on the internet.  I also read that the covid vaccination can trigger shingles in certain recipients.

After the second dose, I stayed home for the next couple days, and I noticed that I got the same rash (both times mostly on my left hand and forearm). Rash seems harmless - no pain, etc, though it itched the first time. Went away after a week or so. The second dose rash, I didn&#39;t feel or notice until yesterday afternoon (48 hours post vaccination), and it does not itch this time. Rash is small pinpoint red spots. Some were raised the first time, but none appear to be so this time.

                                                Client received the 2nd COVID vaccine (Moderna Lot # 026C21A expiration 6/27/2021) at 1502. At 1537, client asked EMT is it normal to feel a little warm and for my lips to tingle?? PHN overheard and escorted client to the zero gravity chair while EMT obtained the E kit and vital sign equipment. Upon further assessment, the client stated, ?about 5 minutes before my 30 minutes were up, my lips started to feel weird and slowly increased then plateaued. I feel flush and like my heart rate is elevated.? Client was not experiencing any shortness of breath, or tightness in his throat. PHN had client remove his mask to assess his lips. Client?s lips were slightly swollen with few darker pigmentations in areas. PHN also had client look at his lips, to assess if this was his baseline, and client stated, ?my lips have more color than normal.? Client?s skin was slightly red on his face. Client was alert and oriented times 4. Benadryl was offered to client by PHN and client refused. Client stated, ?I want to see if it goes back to normal on its own, and I don?t want to be drowsy.? Vital signs were taken at 1541 (heart rate 80, oxygen 96%, blood pressure 124/84). Vital signs taken at 1551 (heart rate 76, oxygen 96%, heart rate 130/86). At 1553, client stated, ?the tingliness is decreasing.? At 1557, client stated, ?I don?t feel flush anymore. I almost feel 100% normal, like 10% tingly compared to earlier.? At 1557, PHN assessed client?s lips and they appeared to be less swollen with pigmentation that was appropriate to race. Vital signs taken at 1600 (heart rate 78, oxygen 97%, blood pressure 126/96). Vital signs taken at 1606 (heart rate 81, oxygen 96%, blood pressure 128/84). Client is allergic to avocados and said that his throat swells up when he eats them, and he is also allergic to dairy. Client does not have any medical conditions and is not taking and medications. PHN provided client with education on life threatening symptoms and when to seek emergency services. PHN also advised client to follow up with primary care provider and to consult with an allergist before receiving another COVID vaccine in the future. At 1607, client stated, ?I feel good,? and left the facility unassisted with a steady gait.

On day 4 of taking this medication, my right leg completely resolved of the swelling and heaviness and the &#34;bruise&#34; completely resolved without any discoloration.  This makes me think the &#34;bruise&#34; was engorged capillary vessels that were not flowing due to the clot.

                                                I received the Vaccine on Wednesday 1/6/2021 . Later that evening, my right deltoid was slightly swollen and painful. I would rate the pain 5/10. The next day Thursday 1/7/21, I noticed intermittent heart flutter/palpitations. I had my routine morning coffee and I thought the combination of the vaccine and the coffee might be the caused.  The flutter/palpitations continue to the present. I don&#39;t have shortness of breath. The left deltoid pain and swelling subsided. The flutter is intermittent and last 10 to 15 seconds.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

                                                Patient report arm pain after receiving the covid vaccine 12/29. Patient reported to the ER on 1/6 for further evaluation regarding arm pain. Per patient the ER doctor stated that at the covidvax clinic the medical personelle administering the vaccine may have hit a blood vessel in his shoulder where the injection was. Patient explains the bruising is still there but the pain is radiating through the armpit and into his bicep through his elbow. Patient reports that his arm is not swollen and the yellow bruise had faded.  Reports 1/8 that using hot packs and ibuprofen make the pain subside.   1/11 reports arm pain is not getting worse but the pain and discomfort are staying about the same.

The next morning, the hive had reduced, but a new one was seen on the right side of the base of my neck.  Very red and irritated looking but no pain or itching.   There were also 2 or 3 smaller hives a few inches below and to the right of my navel.  This was the only area in which I experienced itchiness.  I have pictures of the last two areas where this occurred.  Hives reduced each day until done.  The last to clear up was the one on my neck.  Total duration, approximately 3 or 4 days.   The areas seemed to line up with parts of the lymphatic system, when I looked up a map of it.

                                                8 days after the shot, the shoulder where I received the injection developed a red rash that was raised and swollen. It was painful and warm to the touch. I called a doctor and they prescribed me antibiotics thinking it was an infection. The rash dissipated in another day or two and soreness went away but then returned 5 days later.

                                                2-3 hours after injection, just muscular pain at joint site injection that worsened to be mild-moderate over next 14 hours. 8 hours after receiving injection, developed mild global headache. 14 hours after receiving injection, developed chills/shivering and temperature was 100.0 F. Took 1000mg acetaminophen and symptoms improved after about 45 minutes. 8 hours later only mild headache and fatigue, with mild-moderate left deltoid discomfort. All symptoms improved significantly after another 1000mg dose acetaminophen. Currently 26 hours post injection, and feeling no need to present for evaluation as I expected these side effects.

                                                About 12 hours after the 2nd dose was given, I woke up at 2:30am with a severe headache, uncontrollable chills, muscular discomfort, soreness at the injection site, and fatigue.  I took 2 Tylenol, the chills subsided about 15 minutes after they began, and the headache was better about 30 minutes after taking the Tylenol.  I was in and out of sleep on the couch until around 6am, and I took my temperature at that time.  It was 102 degrees.  I took a couple more Tylenol at 7am and contained to take 2 every 4 hours (last dose around 6pm that night).  My temperature reduced gradually, but it was still over 101 degrees around noon.  By 6-7pm my fever was gone and didn&#39;t return.  I called out of work sick, and I fell back asleep in bed from 8am-11:30am.  I woke up with significant muscle pain in my left theigh (I sleep on my left side, but the pain was much more pronounced than usual).  This lasted 3-4 hours.  Overall, less acute muscle soreness lasted the full length of pronounced reactivity (~2:30am to ~6:30pm on 02/09).  Fatigue was evident until a went to bed around 11:30pm and not noted when I woke up at 6:30am on 02/10 for work.  Soreness at the injection site (left arm) gradually decreased over about 3 days following the injection, but it never impaired my ability to engage in everyday tasks.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes post injection, PT began complaining of severe itching on back and shoulders, but not about the injection site.  PT promptly began to itch himself aggressively. No visible rashes or hives appeared anywhere; no involvement of the face, lips, or throat. Staff at the care facility in which the PT resides attested to this being a typical behavior of this patient when he is experiencing stress or anxiety. Nevertheless, the patient was monitored until his agitation subsided. Epinephrine was not administered.

                                                Small (dime sized) bright pink slightly bumpy rash appeared on upper arm about 2 inches away from where I received my injection. It was itchy otherwise not bothersome. I  put a non medicated  ointment on it overnight. Rash grew in size overnight. When I woke it was larger than a quarter with an extension or piece. It remained itchy and  bright pink.  I washed the ointment off and dried the rash.  This time I applied an anti itch cream. The cream seemed to tone the itch a lot and also stopped it from growing in size. By the next morning (today) it was light pink in color and less itchy. Now (6pm) it is hardly visible any more. I can still feel it when I run my fingers over it softly and it still itches, but color and raised bumps have improved significantly.

Patient reports very intense dull/sharp pain and itching especially during and shortly after a bowel movement. Patient did report that there was an increase in fiber intake via red beans and rice his mother made for him and ate it for 5 days in a row last week. Patient is self treating with over-the-counter oral pain relievers, suppositories, tucks wipes with witch-hazel, and some butt cream coworkers husband gave to him. There is a history or rectal disorders with patient but had been 10 years since last occurrence. Patient does not currently feel that the vaccine has directly caused the  external hemorrhoids or the anus but felt it his duty to report any and all adverse events experienced following the vaccine given to his person.

The events were not severe, did not require me to visit a Doctor or take any medication apart from lying in bed for most of the time. The adverse events included: Moderate pain throughout whole body, moderate-to-severe pain at the injection site, feverish feeling (I did not measure the temperature), occasional chill, temporary loss of taste in my tongue for a day or two, lack of appetite, acidic sensation in my upper throat, partially blocked nasal passages, moderate fatigue

The lymph nodes swelled to roughly marble to golf ball sized protrusions in the occipital region of my head. This swelling as also accompanied by more swelling on the top right side of my head and also my skin began to break due to the swelling. Extreme headaches and swelling only started to subside on the right side of the back of my head after I received a steroid shot at an urgent care clinic. The steroid did not diminish the swelling and extreme pain on the right side of my head. A few days after this, I went to another urgent care clinic which diagnosed me some kind of infection due to the swelling and then prescribed me topical and oral antibiotics. As I right this, over three weeks from my first dose, I have scabbing and still some pain in the right side of my head.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after my second Moderna vaccine, I experienced the typical body aches, chills, headache, and tiredness expected in someone my age (38).  I was initially happy that my immune system seemed to have a positive response to the second dose.  About 24 hours after my second dose, I developed a severe headache and nerve pain all over the right side of my head.  No over the counter medicine would relieve the pain.  The next day, I developed a rash on my forehead.  The rash quickly spread and consumed the right side of my face and my right eye.  I was seen by medical staff, and received a diagnosis of severe shingles.  I was given Valtrex and, eventually, gabapentin.  My eye continued to get worse and I lost clear vision in my right eye.  I saw an ophthalmologist and was told that the shingles had activated in the eye.  My eye pressure was dangerously high.  I was given steroid drops and drops to relieve eye pressure.     Since February 22, I have battled shingles.  My rash is gone and my eye has cleared.  But, I still suffer from intense nerve pain in my head, forehead, and eye.  All medical professionals opined that the moderna vaccine must have played a role given the timing.  If shingles can be considered a side effect, it is one that has been intense and long-lasting.

                                                On March 24, 2021, the day of the shot, I only felt soreness in my left arm. The next morning, March 25, 2021, I began to feel body aches, chills, and I was in a cold sweat. I took ibuprofen throughout the day to combat the symptoms. The evening of March 25, 2021, the pain was much more severe (body aches all over my body, including my face, teeth, my hands were sore and stiff, etc.). I did not sleep much of the night because the symptoms were very uncomfortable due to the chills and cold sweats. The morning of March 26, 2021, my left armpit began to swell. By the afternoon, my left armpit (the arm where I received the vaccine) was swollen, tender, and soft. There is some redness and the swelling and tenderness are more pervasive. It is difficult to hang my arm at my side due to the pain and swelling. I understand, after calling the nurse hotline, that this is a common side effect but I also have a skin condition (Hidradenitis Supparativa) and it is difficult to know whether flare-ups are triggered by environmental factors.

                                                This was my second dose of the Moderna vaccine.  I had no reactions other than a slightly sore shoulder after the first dose. After the second it was exactly the same until about 5 days after when I developed an itchy, swollen, hot, rash on my arm around the injection site.  Now on day 2 it has roughly doubled in size, and is incredibly annoying! I am using ice blocks and calamine lotion to try and reduce the itching and heat its giving off.

                                                Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA). The person administering the vaccine on behalf of CIC Health, whose name I later learned, injected the vaccine too high (roughly level with the acromion process) and far back. Initially there was only a quick burning sensation. The pain started about an hour later, but at that point it was mild and only notable because of the quick onset and slightly different feel from the first dose. Over the next few hours, it intensified and I began to lose the majority of the range of motion in that arm due to excruciating pain. I saw my primary care physician the next morning, he confirmed the positioning of the injection was incorrect. As of writing, ~56 hours after vaccination, the pain and limited range of motion have not yet resolved.

                                                Around 12:30pm on 4/24/2021, I noticed a small knot on my right arm, about 3 inches toward my hand from the injection site. The injection site was in my upper deltoid. The small knot measures about 1&#34; (in the direction of elbow to shoulder) by 2&#34; and the muscle in this area feels tight. The area is also slightly pink, slightly raised, midly itchy, and quite warm to the touch. I was advised that this is a typical event that may occur ~1 week after receiving Moderna vaccine. No medical intervention is planned, provided that the symptoms do not worsen.

Left shoulder/arm however remains quite painful.

About a week later, the pain got worse and moved toward his chest. It got so bad, he had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital to find out he had been having a heart attack. He spent nearly three weeks in the hospital before he died on 4/15/21

All came in less than 24 hrs after injection. It felt like all the covid symptoms at once from when I had the virus initially in April 2020. I?ve been tested for antibodies twice in the last twelve months, once in June 2020, and once in January 2021; both time positive for at least Igg antibodies. Was re-exposed to the virus in Feb 2021 and had two negative tests a week apart from each other. The first test was 5 days after re-exposure.

                                                Three days after the first injection I noticed an itching sensation in my genital region. Upon closer inspection I noticed blister like bumps just under the head of my penis and down my scrotum. Initially I tried lotion, then Neosporin and finally Cortisone to stop the intense itching. When I shower with hot water it intensifies the itching. I went to the doctors on 4-26 and Dr. prescribed Prednisone. He&#39;s trying to get me into the dermatologist but the earliest is May 7th.

                                                On Friday, April 2nd, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  Within minutes, my heart started racing and I felt faint.  Thereafter, my hands and face got the sensation of tingling.  It felt like ice was running through my veins.  My heart stopped racing approximately fifteen or so minutes after it began.  The tingling sensation in my hands and face ended approximately one hour later.  I also noticed a strange taste in my mouth during this same timeframe.  Subsequently, I had the sensation of being dizzy and lightheaded.  Importantly, I have never reacted to a vaccine in this manner.  On Saturday, April 3rd, I woke up with symptoms that were to be expected.  My arm was very sore and I felt a little achy.  However, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded.    That evening and for the next week or so, my heart was beating rapidly, and my blood pressure was elevated.  I also had the continuous feeling of my skin crawling.  My hands and feet also seemed to be experiencing tremors and twitching.    On Sunday, April 4th, I woke up and noticed that my right eye seemed a little blurry as I read an article on my phone.  I assumed I must have slept on my eye wrong and did not pay it much attention.  I do not recall my eye being blurry for the rest of the day.  The following morning on Monday, April 5th, I woke up once again feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  As I walked to the restroom, I noticed that my right eye was blurry again.  This time it seemed to be more pronounced.  Moreover, when I closed my right eye, I could see hundreds of dots in different colors.  In addition to having blurry vision, my legs felt weak and nearly buckled as I walked.  I felt like I was intoxicated.  Upon returning to bed, my teeth began chattering and I felt like I was freezing.  I called my doctor?s office and spoke with a PA who recommended that I go to the ER.    While I checked in at the ER, I could not remember my ZIP code.  I felt like my brain was not running on all cylinders.  Upon explaining my symptomology to the ER doctor, she recommended that I have my blood drawn and that I get an MRI to rule out a stroke.  All test results came back normal.    On Wednesday, April 7th, I made an appointment with an allergist.  They tested me to see if I was allergic to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polysorbate 80.  For the skin scratch portion of the test, neither of the substances had much of a reaction on my skin.  I thought the Polysorbate 80 scratch had a little bit of redness to it, but it was negligible.  When the doctor injected Polysorbate 80 under my skin with a syringe, a welt formed.  I am not sure why, but PEG was not injected in the same manner.  As a result of the test, the allergist confirmed that I am allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He mentioned that there may be instances of cross reactivity to PEG for individuals that are allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He recommended that I not get the second Moderna dose unless it was administered in a controlled setting.    On Sunday April 11th, I noticed what felt like a hard vein in my abdominal fat.  It felt slightly tender to the touch.  I was fearful that it could be a clot.  On Tuesday, April 13th, I woke up and as a I stood in the shower, my foot was painful to stand on.  On top of my right foot near my ankle, I could visibly see red inflammation in a vein.  I massaged the vein and the redness and pain dissipated.  Being fearful that I did have blood clots, I scheduled an appointment with a PA at my doctor?s office that same day.  We discussed my ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and me being fearful of blood clots.  She had an EKG performed at the office and ordered a barrage of blood tests.  Everything continued to be normal.    On Sunday, April 18th, I again went to the ER, because the hard vein in my stomach became larger and more tender to the touch.  When I bent over, it felt like there was a lot of pressure emanating from the hard vein down to my groin.  Once again, blood was drawn and everything was normal.  I also had an ultrasound performed on the area that felt like a hard vein and the doctor concluded that it was most likely swollen lymph nodes.  I was diagnosed with lymphadenopathy.    On Monday, April 26th, I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss the ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and pain in my stomach and groin area.  He told me that he had seen other patients that were experiencing similar symptoms and that my immune system was possibly overreacting to the vaccine.  He told me the symptoms should go away in time.  He also ordered a new blood test to check for clots.  The D-Dimer test came back normal.    On Tuesday, April 27th, I experienced a painful genital herpes outbreak.  I normally get one every year.  I had just recovered from an infection in December of 2020.  This outbreak was more intense and for the first time I had nerve pain that wrapped around my hip and down my inner thigh.  As of a week later, the infection is almost gone.      Today is May 4th, and I am still experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness.  Some days are better than others and every time I get optimistic that my dizziness and lightheadedness is finally gone, it reappears.  Being an IT consultant business owner and an attorney, I need to think clearly for my profession.  The side effects from the Moderna vaccine have made it very difficult to function.  I would like to get fully vaccinated, but I am fearful of getting the second shot.  I do not want the vaccine to cause permanent neurological damage or worse.    Finally, I am sure your organization is aware, but there are many other people experiencing the same symptoms as me.

                                                I noticed a tingling sensation on my in my left arm that goes goes about mid way from my bicep to my hand.  It is best described as when your hand falls asleep and your getting sensation back, that pins and needle feeling.  When condition first occurred I figured it may have been dry skin as I just got done on 5/23/2021 working heavily in the sun and had a mild sunburn.  I did not even apply skin lotion at this time.  I did not notice anything unusual on 5/24/2021 as I worked hard the day before and my arms were tired.  On 5/25/2021 I noticed it and it still felt like a tired arm but the tingling never left.  While it is not painful or debilitating it&#39;s presence is known and is uncomfortable.    I have held my arm up and performed other tests to rule out stroke.  AT this time I am reporting it and will continue to monitor the situation and alert you if it gets worse or gets better.

                                                I started with an itchy rash on my legs behind my knees. AT first I thought it was just bug bites, then it popped up on both my elbows, my hands and my feet. On my hands it was really swollen. It began a few days after my vaccination, I don&#39;t know exactly when. I contacted the DR on 28th or 29th of January, I can&#39;t remember the exact dates. The DR gave me cortisone as well as clobetasol and betamethasone (creams).The rashes went away in about a week after having medications.

He reports to me that at approximately 11pm to 12 am after the shot he developed multiple blotches/speckles in his vision.  He also states he is experiencing some balance issues/vertigo but feels it could be due to vision issue.  Patient called me at 2:25pm on 6/8/21 and was still experiencing the vision issues.  He was waiting on a call back from his physician for advisement.  He also states that he was experiencing injection site pain, diarrhea, and stomach pain but experienced these same adverse effects with this first moderna vaccine.

                                                Patient called the pharmacy  (6/5/21) to talk about his Moderna Covid vaccinations. He stated he felt drained and sluggish. He had his 1st dose on 5/5/21 and his 2nd dose on 6/2/21. In general he has had the following: Headache, dry mouth, body aches, nausea, and fatigue. I asked him how he felt  the day he called on 6/5/21 (3 days post his second dose). He stated that he still had a headache and was fatigued (he only felt like lying down). Patient is an employee here and wanted to know what he should do about returning to work. I referred him to store manager. I gave her his number and she was going to call him. He had spoken to managers before 6/5/21. I explained that these side effects are possible with vaccines and that some patients respond with more side effects than others or have a stronger response. However, I am filing  a VAERS because the patient mentioned that he had the following after his 2nd dose. He stated that about an hour after his vaccine on 6/2/21, he had hives and itching on his arms and neck and dry throat. He stated that he has used Benadryl and hydrocortisone to treat these symptoms. I asked him did he have any reaction after his 1st dose on 5/5/21. He stated that he had itching in his throat after the 1st one, but he thought it was just a dry throat and did not know if it was coming from the vaccine. As far as I know, 6/5/21 was the first day that the he had let anyone at the pharmacy know about any side effects. I told him to let his primary care doctor know this information that we discussed. I also recommended that he could take Tylenol if he wanted to do so.  Patient used a Doctor on Demand service through employee and provider prescribed aspirin 325 mg tablet once daily.

It did not appear to be bacterial. It spontaneously resolved a few weeks after each dose. Sensorineural hearing loss occurred about two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. This was confirmed by audiometric testing which showed a significant unilateral hearing loss in the right ear.  A prednisone taper was started followed by two transtympanic injections of dexamethasone over the next six weeks. There was no improvement. A hearing aid is now required.

                                                Approximately 1 week after the second dose in upper right arm, dull pain developed and crept up the arm, into the shoulder, and up left side of neck.  Approximately 3rd week after the second dose, a progressively growing sensitivity to a part of the sunlight spectrum began to develop (from minutes before sunup until sundown it feels as if my body is being microwaved on a cellular level) as well as marked increase in heat sensitivity with inability for body to process heat (takes hours to cool down from 20 minutes of indirect activity in sunlight, 10 minutes or less in direct sunlight).  This continued until I broke out in probably unrelated severe contact dermatitis from using baby oil (first time, and last time) , whom also broke out from the contact and also had the moderna vaccines on the same days with me.  I went to local Primary Care Physician and communicated about the problem, yet also let them know the effects of the sun and the microwaving feeling that was unrelated. Prescribed creams.   Wife&#39;s diminished of its own Accord. Mine healed slower over two weeks.  During this time, the sun spectrum sensitivity got worse and worse (possibly gamma rays...I have no idea. It feels like I am being microwaved as I type this and it is heavily cloudy outside and i can sleep in a completely dark room and feel it from sun up to sundown. After sundown it takes my body 5-6 hours to process the microwaving effect, and then starts all over again at sunup. It is absolute hell. I would not wish it on anyone for any reason ever.)  I feel like I am dying, and my skin started itching about 2 weeks ago, and is now so bad that I can barely stay sane and have to sleep in another room so my wife can sleep without me waking her.

He received COVID-19 vaccine on 1/13/2021 and immediately developed numbness and tingling in the area of injection which was the left shoulder.  Over the next 15 to 30 minutes numbness and tingling expanded to the left side of his body including face arm and leg and the left side of his trunk.  He began to feel foggy and had some slurred speech.  He presented to the Emergency Room and tests were performed to rule out a stroke.  The patient denies any other symptoms such as fever chills myalgias.  He did not have any weakness of the extremities.  He did not have any speech disturbances or visual disturbances.  This morning on examination he states his symptoms are much better.  He still has some residual numbness in his leg and arm.  Facial numbness is almost all gone.  As of 1/18/2021, residual numbness and tingling is only in his left ring and pinky finger.

My body Temperature measurement (using oral and touch thermometer) started  to increase from 99, 100, 101 to 102 F on multiple different occasions. I was able to eat but with minimal appetite.   Before eating I took Theraflu which contains 650 mg Tylenol it didn&#39;t work well. Until evening I took 2 tabs Tylenol 500 mg , slept for 4 hours,  woke up with sweat, feeling better not very weak and my temperature went down to 99 F.   Took another 2 tabs an hour later and woke up in the morning normal but little bit tired (Day#2).  Monday( Day#3) normal not my usual energy, but better than Day #2.

                                                Besides the usual and expected muscle pain, injection site soreness, and headache, I experienced a mild allergic reaction. Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Lot#, handwritten), I experienced a mild swelling of my face and throat. I noticed the throat swelling when I drank water and also noticed my face tightening up. I have a severe allergic reaction to peaches, so I&#39;m hypersensitive to these types of reactions, and I was a little worried.  My throat and face were swollen for about an hour, but very mild compared to my reaction to peaches,  and it subsided after about 2 hours or so.

My skin was warm to the touch, body aches and pain and sniffles, lots of congestion and complete fatigue and severe muscle aches. I had a slight headache also but in the middle of the night 2/3 to 2/4 I woke up drenched from sweat and had to redress because my clothes were soaked.  On 2/4 I had to have the air on because I was so hot but never developed a fever.  On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.

                                                COVID arm.  The afternoon of 2/19, noticed an itchy sensation on my left arm where I received my COVID vaccine shot.  The area started to turn red and was warm to the touch.  Over the next 2-3 days, the redness continued to grow.  The area was slightly itchy but not unbearable.  The redness has continued to spread, but seems to be lessen in brightness as of 2/22.  Out of curiosity, I used a an IR thermometer, and it read 101 degree F on the red area but only 93-94 on the unaffected area lower on the same arm.  Started taking some ibuprofen on 2/21 to see if it would lessen the inflammation.  Arm is still red and warm to the touch as of today (2/22).  Itchiness seems to have decreased.  Contacted my doctor to notify them and also to be sure that there was nothing else to do at this time.

Was told it looks like ring worm tried lotrimin OTC, no help. but persisted and over the next few weeks flattened some what but was pruritic throughout. Was treated with topical steroid triacinolone which helped the pruritus but the rash was mostly staying the same until the second dose of the vaccine. After the second dose of the moderna vaccine which was 2/17/21 the rash expanded laterally along the upper glute and down the posterior thigh mostly along the S1 dermatome. No pain was noted, only pruritus. Was seen in clinic today and was initiated on valtrex 1000mg BID x10d, and refill of topical triamcinolone

                                                @ 3-5 min... arm started feeling a little sore, like a dead arm. That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

Only soreness in injection arm remained the next day.  Moderate/noticeable fatigue lasted until second day after vaccination, when soreness and fatigue were barely noticeable.

I also had a number of large hives acrss my right bicep and elbow, as well as a few smaller hives on my back and underneath my feet.    This reaction was the same reaction I received when I went to the ER on 12/10/2018 for difficulty breathing and an elevated BP.  The ER administered TORODOL and I reacted the same way, ending up in the ER the very next day due to the reaction.    I believe, after much diligent research, the reaction I received to the COVID vaccine was due to the Tromethamine in it, as this ingredient is also in TORODOL.

Then this past Monday (15 Mar 2021), patient started developing shortness of breath and a resting heart rate of 135bmp. That day, the patient was taken to urgent care.  There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal.

Pain radiated through body with slightest movement, felt in joints, muscles, bones.  Only alleviated by laying perfectly still.  Both injection sights became painful during this period, one in both arms.  Worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life, thought I might need to call ambulance and upon reflection, probably should have. Since then chills and sweating periods with minor exertion, getting less severe as time passes, but within norm.

                                                I am a healthy 39 year old with no major health problems. About 2 weeks after my first vaccine dose I noticed a numbness that spread from my left low back to my left side and left front of my abdomen. It was accompanied by itching and and tingling. The doctor I talked to today said it was consistent with shingles and prescribed the antiviral Famciclovir. I don&#39;t know if it is connected to the vaccine, but I want to make sure that it is reported in case there is a pattern.

There was some pain, the area was raised and swollen and hot to the touch. For the past couple days, my armpits, groin and breasts were tender also. After I noticed the rash, I checked and my left armpit (injection arm) was considerably more swollen and tender than the right. Took two benadryl and went to sleep. Woke up and the red tenderness was all still there. I took one more benadryl and it has not spread.  Unfortunately it hasn&#39;t gone down much, either.

During one trip to bathroom where bladder was drained, felt nauseated and light-headed. Got into position to vomit into toilet, and upon getting up, fainted. Spent the rest of the day with high levels of nausea, soreness, and headaches. At the end of the day, with more ibuprophen and pepto bismol, was able to sit up and interact. Food body would accept without nausea was crackers/toast. At end of the night, left shoulder was swollen and red around injection site, radiating out approximately 4in.

                                                Starting around 9:00pm with general malaise that developed into severe nausea and joint pain over next two hours. Pain was severe enough to bring tears. Began treating with Tylenol 650mg every 4-6hrs, which seemed to help initially. Starting around 11pm, I had severe chills with uncontrollable tremors lasting next 3-4hrs. Could not stop shaking, could not get warm. Intense joint pain continued. Was able to sleep intermittently from 2-3am, but awoke with return of severe nausea and vertigo/dizziness around 3am, accompanied by profuse sweating and hot flashes. I laid on cold tile floor with ice-pack on head/chest until it passed, about 30min, and nearly called for ambulance. Treated nausea by inhaling vapor from rubbing alcohol and taking a dose of zofran dissolving tab, which seemed to help. Able to sleep 4am-9am May 15th and return to normal diet. Malaise continued throughout 15th, but gradually subsided. Rashes in armpits and hot sweats night of 15th. I appear to be mostly normal as of today, May 17th.

By Day 6 the rod felt smaller than a regular sized jujube and after that it was gone.  Vaccine 2 side effect Had 102 fever next day but felt OK the preceeding day. Arm where injection was also itches a little from time to time, but not as much as it did the day after getting the Vaccine.

He brings pictures of the rash when it was at its worst, on his phone--and appears to be true allergic reaction with hives scattered on forearm, and hives/very large erythema on injection site. He now has hyperpigmentation over the site of where the rash was, and I believe this to be a post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from the allergic reaction.

                                                The night of my second shot (around 8pm PST) I experienced extreme warm sensations in both feed, almost able to feel the contours of the nerves in my feet.  My toungue also felt cold later that night, and the nerves in my legs felt cold, despite my skin feeling warm.  I continued feeling warm sensations across both feet in the evenings and when sleeping throughout the following 2 weeks.  Beyond that I&#39;ve continued to have a warm/swollen sensation in the nerves in my legs below my knees, concentrated in shins.  I&#39;ve had a similar sensation in my forearms.    It should be noted that after my first shot (on 3/30), about a week later I started developing intermitent headaches, and then around mid april developed intermitent facial numbness and and some pain in my left jaw and around my teeth, but the proximity to my first shot wasnt as close, so didnt report that in this form.

I am starting to have acne in places all over my body that I have not had before or rarely had. Pustules on my arms, especially forearms, which is odd and has never happened before.
