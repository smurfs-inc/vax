                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection at 6 pm I began to experience right sided ankle pain and swelling and mild chills. The pain peaked about 2 hours later about a 5/10 and was constant. I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen and elevated my foot. The right ankle was visibly swollen and red compared to the left.  Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

I took another look in the mirror at 8pm tonight and noticed the rash has become larger, slightly raised, warm, and more pronounced. The rash is not itchy and does not hurt.

Rash started in chest/upper torso and progressed to bilateral arms, back, upper buttocks, and thighs. Rash feels like a sunburn in that it makes the subject feel warm. Rash is blanchable and fully pinpoint-macular, no papules or plaques.   At approx. 36 hours post-vaccine, the rash had spread down both arms and up the neck, sparing the face. The rash gets intensely pruritic when scratched or itched. There is no pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, or other compromise of the subject&#39;s health or well-being.

Described as if &#34;someone punched me in the armpit.&#34; Symptoms worsened by the next morning, so on 2/22/2021 patient sought care at a local Urgent Care facility. Treating provider felt symptoms were most consistent with cellulitis of the right axilla. One week course of antibiotics (Bactrim 1 tab twice daily) was prescribed. Follow up with PCP was recommended for 2-3 days or sooner if symptoms worsened or additional symptoms presented. No laboratory testing or radiology procedures were performed. Patient filled prescription for antibiotics and started taking same day. On 2/25/2021 patient reported that symptoms were improving but not completely resolved.

                                                On the 8th day, I unconsciously started rubbing and scratching my arm over two layers of clothing. I quickly realized what I was doing and the location of the reaction. I took of my clothes and noticed redness, swelling, and localized Hives around the injection site.  The reaction was about 2 inches by 2 inches in a circle directly at the injection site. This reaction lasted about an hour before swelling and hives dissipated. Redness is still active 2 hours prior as I am writing this.

The pain has improved but rash is still present. I was advised to go to the ER and be evaluated. I went down around 2245 received Pepcid and Benadryl and was told to follow up with my primary care provider and an allergist prior to second dose.  The next day the rash spread to my stomach and chest&#34;

He doesn&#39;t complain of any pain or other signs of illness at this time. This area has not enlarged nor has it reduced since I&#39;ve begun to monitor him.

Left deltoid; he was monitored for 30 minutes after administration, and then intermittently assessed throughout the evening showing no signs of reaction. Overnight, he did not sleep and began to become restless and 0400 his prior normal 97s-98s temp had increased to 99.8. At 0500 he vomited a large amount and temp was 102.1, at which point he was given PRN acetaminophen for fever. SpO2 fell to 90%, and he was started on O2 at 4 L it was also noted his abdomen was distended, and he had erythema on his left arm extending from the base of his neck to his wrist.

Four days following the vaccination (currently ongoing),  I started experiencing body aches, fatigue, a slight headache, and an elevated temperature.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

                                                Moderna vaccine dose #1 received in right shoulder on 12/31/20 at 2:15PM. Injection was uneventful other than sensation of pressure. I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head. I am concerned with the possibility of long term and/or permanent damage after reviewing the literature. I am also concerned about how many other healthcare workers the person who gave me my vaccine may be injuring and/or causing permanent harm to.

Coincides with getting his first covid vaccine 5-7 days earlier. Occurred the evening after his first swim after the covid vaccine. Exam notable for significant pain and shoulder instability.

It was painful to move (the same as it was the day after the shot).  The next morning the swelling had gone down and the red was fading.  It is almost completely back to normal as of 1/13/21.

Approximately 10 to 15 minutes after he received the vaccine both of his forearms started to turn red in color. He stated that they were itching. He had no other adverse reactions. Being he was not short of breath and had no facial or tongue swelling, no nausea or vomiting, it was decided that his mother would take him home and contact his primary care provider for direction or she would possibly give him some Benadryl at home and follow up with his PCP as needed. If any other reactions developed she would take him to the Emergency Department if needed. They left the vaccine clinic approximately 40 - 45 minutes after he had received the vaccine.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

Right foot feels broken, but cannot be fractured as it was fine and experienced no injuries before or after receipt of the vaccine.

                                                On Sunday evening, January 10th, I started becoming increasingly itchy in my face. I noticed it was blotchy and I had hives. My scalp was also very irritated. When I showered later that evening, I noticed that I had red dots on various parts of my body. This has since by diagnosed as dermatitis. On Monday &amp; Tuesday, the 11 and 12 respectively, the hives, blotchiness and general irritation to my face and scalp got worse and I was very itchy.. The dermatitis continued to spread across my body include my torso &amp; arms. My upper thigh also has some red dots but the rest of my legs, to date, appear to be okay. As of this writing, my entire body is itchy, but is general discomfort and hardly debilitating. As a note, I have not changed my laundry soap, bath soap, eaten anything different, etc as possible explanations for my hives and dermatitis. The only thing new in the last week and half has been the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine

                                                Two days after receiving vaccine in left deltoid, my left ear became bright red and registered 100*F on multiple thermometers. The area around my ear remained 98.7*F. As it progressed I developed minor amounts of blotchy red areas along the hairline on the left side of my face only. Nothing occured on the right side of my body. Diarrhea developed with multiple episodes. All of this lasted approx. 3 hours before subsiding without treatment. I have had significant amount of vaccines and immunizations from the civilian and military sectors and never suffered this before.

It is slightly tender to the touch and otherwise there&#39;s a general feeling of pressure at the site.  As of today, the 23rd, it is still swollen and similar in size.

                                                Developed a sizable rash in the deltoid which started a little more than 24 hours after the injection. This only occurred after my second dose. The rash was dark red, was warm to the touch, and felt tight. No increased pain or itching. I took a antihistamine the following day and these seemed to help reduce the rash. It was gone after 4 days.

The next day, I experienced severe fatigue and my temperature  was over 99*. My arm was still tender and I also had a lot of nausea. Last night after work, I took two aspirin and slept 10 hours and now I feel much better with some energy.

One of my colleagues (a surgeon) looked and me and prescribed. Treatment was antihistamine and steroid DosePac . The rash may have improved with  the treatment; however, the blisters took awhile to heal and I&#39;m still itchy. Swings in temperature  -in the room, or in the water or anywhere it swings - the itching gets worse. I crawl up my skin for the itching. I&#39;ve tried cremes and calamine lotion and oatmeal baths.

When I try to use it, it caused mild pain. After waking up, my left arm deltoid muscle was visibly swollen and has a medium amount of pain and significantly decreased range of motion. Because this event has not yet resolved, I may seek advice from my primary care doctor later today

Blood test showed that I am suddenly highly allergic to 19 different food groups. I have no known food allergies prior to C19 Moderna Vaccine. I have had hives every single day since they 1st appeared (3.5 days after vaccine). I have had multiple days of facial swelling as well and have been to the hospital multiple times. To this date (date of this report) I still have hives and facial swelling. Facial swelling is intermittent. I have stayed away from the list of foods that I am apparently suddenly allergic to and I still have hives and swelling. I occasionally have a irritated throat which makes it difficult to breathe in. I have a specialist appointment with an allergy/immunology doctor this coming Thursday to see what thier diagnosis is. My family doctor believes my potential angioedema diagnosis is directly related to my 1st dose of C19 Moderna Vaccine.

I went to the hospital because I felt I was going to throw up and I had to hold on to my stomach, felt a stabbing sensation to my stomach and the pain was unbearable. They performed an ultrasound of the abdomen and a CT scan of the abdomen. I also had an endoscopy performed after my 2nd vaccine. I had a biopsy of my stomach and I am pending results.

                                                Patient symptoms of chills, headache, and body aches began on Sunday 3/28, 6 days after vaccination.   One day later, on 3/29, patient started experiencing pain in the right armpit, the same shoulder where the vaccine was received.  That pain built up until Wednesday 3/31, when the arm was very swollen, purple, and rapidly loosing sensation.  The patient went to the ER.  In the ER, via ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis of the right subclavian and axillary veins.  From 4/1 to 4/2 the patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure, thrombo lysis, using tPA directed by catheter to the site of the 12 cm long clot.  On 4/2, it was determined that the flow was not restored to the vein, and the radiologist informed the patient that right first rib removal would be necessary.  On 4/9, right first rib resection surgery was performed to alleviate pressure on the subclavian vein.  Patient is currently recovering on the blood thinner Eliquis.  Additional procedures for thrombo ectomy and angioplasty will follow in approximately two weeks to clear the subclavian and axillary veins.

                                                I had a little swelling at injection site on day of and night of. The following day the swelling increased and had spread to the armpit area. It was more tender and there was moderate to sever pain in the armpit. I took some advil with minimal relief. On the 3rd day (today) the swelling seemed a littlw worse and the pain increased slightly. I contacted my plastic surgeon (since back in October 2019) because i had a procedure called miradry, which elemintes the sweat glands in my bilateral armpits. The doctor advised me to come in immeidately to the office. Upon arrival the doctor examined the area and was able to se immiedalty that is was swollen. I consented to pictures being taken. He is making an entry as well as I am and I was advised to ice the area and to take advil and to remain in contact.

At about 1030AM I had a very bad headache and was extremely nauseous for about 3 hours and felt like vomiting but did not vomit. This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

First noticed symptoms on 1/8/21 and was treated at the ER where I am employed. Symptoms persist until the present moment, but do not appear to be progressing beyond the current locations. Rash is red, raised, hive-like and itches/burns mildly. Overall reaction moderate in severity and appearance. No anaphylaxis experienced.

Rash is warm to the touch and itchy. Have experienced elevated temperatures at night but unsure if this is due to a reaction of the shot.

                                                Two or three days after the injection, I noticed 3 small blisters at or near the injection side on my left upper arm. There was also some pain and tenderness more or less like the feeling of having a bruise in that area. Those blisters popped a day or two later and I did not notice anything further until 1/21/2021 when I noticed a large red patch on my left upper arm near the injection side. The bruised feeling remained until today. As of the time of writing (1/23/21 4:30pm) the redness has subsided partially but it still visible, and the bruised feeling has almost completely gone away. I visited an urgent care today and the onsite doctor informed me that it was likely a skin reaction to the vaccine and not a skin infection relating to the popped blister.

The next morning, 2/1, the size of the red area increased slightly and it was still warm and hurt when pressure was applied.

                                                About five to six days after the vaccine, extremely itchy hives broke out across various parts of my body, after having no side effects (not even a sore arm) following the vaccine. It went away with no treatment in about 48 hours. I know that is not one of the common side effects and it occurred long after the shot, so I wanted to report it in case anyone else does as well. Of course, it may have been caused by something else, but I have never in my life had anything similar occur; nor had taken any new medications or eaten new foods.

Approximately 8 hours after my 2nd vaccine dose I started uncontrolled shaking with fever. Over course of night my shaking, fever, and chills continued. Fever remained above 101 through course of night, as high as 102.7. Early in morning around 18 hours after injection fever dropped below 100. Severe headache and fatigue day after.

Rash was red, warm to the touch, and after a couple of days it spread.  At least 6 co-workers also expressed the similar symptoms 7-8 days later after administration of the shot.   No treatment done except for use of heating pad for one night.  Will set up a doctor&#39;s appt.

                                                For several hours I had no side effects, including soreness at the injection site. In the evening, maybe 6-8 hours after the injection, the site became sore. After midnight, I started having severe chills and needed several layers of clothing and blankets to stay warm. I checked for a fever and did not have one. In the morning the chills were gone but I had a strong headache that lingered with varying intensity throughout the day. It is unclear if the headache was more from the vaccine or more from a lack of sufficient sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep with the chills. The injection site has continued to be sore and seems to be increasingly sore. After waking up on 1-13-2021, I found myself feeling fatigued and lethargic, not dissimilar to the fatigue I felt when I had COVID. The fatigue has somewhat subsided over the course of the day, with lots of rest helping. The headache and soreness are ongoing, and the fatigue is present but less than earlier today. There&#39;s been somewhat of an ongoing lack of appetite, but I&#39;ve been able to eat in small amounts and keep down what I eat. The chills have come and gone a couple times throughout the day today, but that doesn&#39;t seem to last long.

At the time, I was a few months into treating allergies with sublingual drops. After one week of continued hives, I stopped the drops per the request from the allergy clinic. I got the second vaccine on 1/25 and continue to get very itchy hives. Discontinuing allergy drops and taking Benadryl don?t seem to help.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

Over the course of the night, I fell more ill and finally took my temperature in the morning around 7 AM and had a fever of around 100.4 F. I took Tylenol about every 6 hours for the next 24 hours with my temperature fluctuating between normal and 100.4 F. During this time, I was too ill to do anything more than sleep or lay in bed. The following day, my temperature broke, but I was still experiencing aches, chills, and brain fog, along with the pain at the injection site. After about 84 hours from the time of the vaccination, I felt normal enough to resume my daily activities.

                                                I began to have a fever with chills and very severe body aches that lasted 3 days after the shot and developed the day after the shot was administered. In addition, I developed a rash on my arm and was bedridden. I took a small walk that day and proceeded to swell up on the left side of my body but it subsided within a few hours. The next day, I suffered a stroke due to blot clotting and the clot flowing to my brain. I had to go to the hospital and was there for a few days.

                                                About a week later I noticed itchiness at site of injection. The next day a red welt had appeared around injection site and was hot to the touch. I applied ice and took an Aleve PM as it was time for bed. Next morning I wake up for work and redness has subsided some and is no longer as hot. I still reported it to my manager and Lab Director, who also reported it to the Pharmacy dept and advised me to report it here.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

                                                On Friday April 16th, 2021, at around 12:10 AM, I had responded to an email for work that I forgot to respond to in the afternoon because I was receiving my first Moderna vaccine at that time. The email induced a lot of stress and shortly thereafter I felt my chest feeling heavy and started wondering whether I had trouble breathing. It is currently Friday April 16th at 1:32 AM, I woke up my housemate and we took a walk around the block for about 30 minutes and I am feeling better. Since receiving the Moderna injection, the area that received the injection has felt sore.

                                                I am a board certified infectious diseases pharmacist and I have given lectures over hypersenstivites reactions. I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

Also had nausea (as well as had difficulty wanting to eat because I was nauseous), slight fever of 100, headache (no longer a migraine) and major body aches. Stayed home from work and relaxed on my couch (mostly). Today/currently, on 1/6 at 12:50pm, only symptoms I still have is soreness at injection site (not as sever-more of a discomfort) and slight body ache (not as sever). Last does of Tylenol was taken at 01:30am on 1/6.

I took two ibuprofen and it all stopped aside from soreness around the injection point. Which is still a little sore now at 11:10.  I also had some dizziness around 3:30 pm (2&#43; hours after receiving the shot)

                                                About 10 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, hives developed on the backs of both of my hands and around my right eye. The hives persisted for 6 days (I took Benadryl to stop the itching). After 6 days of hives I went to a walk-in clinic and they prescribed 5 days of Prednasone. Today I am on my 4th day of the Prednasone and the hives are finally starting to clear up.

Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

I felt strong muscle pain at the injected arm around 12 hours later and woke by the pain multiple times. The next day (1/14/2021),  my left arm is still very painful if I lift it. This strong pain lasted a whole day (1/14/2021) and alleviated quite a lot since 1/15/2021. I&#39;m likely to be one of the reported 90% with musle pain.  2. A mild headache similar to mild cold on the night after the injection. It dimishes next morning. This can be ignored.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

After 3 days I observed both my lymph nodes in my armpits were swollen and I felt very fatigued.  No real pain on lymph nodes just swollen.

Nurse informed me of a rash developing at the injection site as well as the right forearm and left temple.  I administered 50mg of Chewable Diphenhydramine and we continued to observe pt. for a further 30 minutes.  His rash improved so we discharged him to his group home.  A follow up call was made this morning, Pt rash continued to improve.

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

                                                I received the Vaccine on Wednesday 1/6/2021 . Later that evening, my right deltoid was slightly swollen and painful. I would rate the pain 5/10. The next day Thursday 1/7/21, I noticed intermittent heart flutter/palpitations. I had my routine morning coffee and I thought the combination of the vaccine and the coffee might be the caused.  The flutter/palpitations continue to the present. I don&#39;t have shortness of breath. The left deltoid pain and swelling subsided. The flutter is intermittent and last 10 to 15 seconds.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

Per patient the ER doctor stated that at the covidvax clinic the medical personelle administering the vaccine may have hit a blood vessel in his shoulder where the injection was. Patient explains the bruising is still there but the pain is radiating through the armpit and into his bicep through his elbow. Patient reports that his arm is not swollen and the yellow bruise had faded.  Reports 1/8 that using hot packs and ibuprofen make the pain subside.   1/11 reports arm pain is not getting worse but the pain and discomfort are staying about the same.

The next morning, the hive had reduced, but a new one was seen on the right side of the base of my neck.  Very red and irritated looking but no pain or itching.   There were also 2 or 3 smaller hives a few inches below and to the right of my navel.  This was the only area in which I experienced itchiness.  I have pictures of the last two areas where this occurred.  Hives reduced each day until done.  The last to clear up was the one on my neck.  Total duration, approximately 3 or 4 days.   The areas seemed to line up with parts of the lymphatic system, when I looked up a map of it.

                                                Small (dime sized) bright pink slightly bumpy rash appeared on upper arm about 2 inches away from where I received my injection. It was itchy otherwise not bothersome. I  put a non medicated  ointment on it overnight. Rash grew in size overnight. When I woke it was larger than a quarter with an extension or piece. It remained itchy and  bright pink.  I washed the ointment off and dried the rash.  This time I applied an anti itch cream. The cream seemed to tone the itch a lot and also stopped it from growing in size. By the next morning (today) it was light pink in color and less itchy. Now (6pm) it is hardly visible any more. I can still feel it when I run my fingers over it softly and it still itches, but color and raised bumps have improved significantly.

Interestingly, he had the second moderna on the right arm and no significant side effects other than some mild soreness lasting 2 days on the right arm.  Left shoulder/arm however remains quite painful.

About a week later, the pain got worse and moved toward his chest. It got so bad, he had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital to find out he had been having a heart attack. He spent nearly three weeks in the hospital before he died on 4/15/21

He received COVID-19 vaccine on 1/13/2021 and immediately developed numbness and tingling in the area of injection which was the left shoulder.  Over the next 15 to 30 minutes numbness and tingling expanded to the left side of his body including face arm and leg and the left side of his trunk.  He began to feel foggy and had some slurred speech.  He presented to the Emergency Room and tests were performed to rule out a stroke.  The patient denies any other symptoms such as fever chills myalgias.  He did not have any weakness of the extremities.  He did not have any speech disturbances or visual disturbances.  This morning on examination he states his symptoms are much better.  He still has some residual numbness in his leg and arm.  Facial numbness is almost all gone.  As of 1/18/2021, residual numbness and tingling is only in his left ring and pinky finger.

                                                Besides the usual and expected muscle pain, injection site soreness, and headache, I experienced a mild allergic reaction. Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Lot#, handwritten), I experienced a mild swelling of my face and throat. I noticed the throat swelling when I drank water and also noticed my face tightening up. I have a severe allergic reaction to peaches, so I&#39;m hypersensitive to these types of reactions, and I was a little worried.  My throat and face were swollen for about an hour, but very mild compared to my reaction to peaches,  and it subsided after about 2 hours or so.

My skin was warm to the touch, body aches and pain and sniffles, lots of congestion and complete fatigue and severe muscle aches. I had a slight headache also but in the middle of the night 2/3 to 2/4 I woke up drenched from sweat and had to redress because my clothes were soaked.  On 2/4 I had to have the air on because I was so hot but never developed a fever.  On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.

                                                COVID arm.  The afternoon of 2/19, noticed an itchy sensation on my left arm where I received my COVID vaccine shot.  The area started to turn red and was warm to the touch.  Over the next 2-3 days, the redness continued to grow.  The area was slightly itchy but not unbearable.  The redness has continued to spread, but seems to be lessen in brightness as of 2/22.  Out of curiosity, I used a an IR thermometer, and it read 101 degree F on the red area but only 93-94 on the unaffected area lower on the same arm.  Started taking some ibuprofen on 2/21 to see if it would lessen the inflammation.  Arm is still red and warm to the touch as of today (2/22).  Itchiness seems to have decreased.  Contacted my doctor to notify them and also to be sure that there was nothing else to do at this time.
