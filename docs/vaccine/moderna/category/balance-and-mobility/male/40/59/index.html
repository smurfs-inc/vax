                                                I received the vaccine 30 min. prior to starting my shift as a Nurse in the ED. About 1 hour after receiving the shot while standing I felt off balance and began to have a vertigo like dizziness. I sat down and tried to drink some water but began spitting the water back up and dry heaving after trying to drink. I did not feel nauseous if I was not drinking. I did feel the sensation of a slight lump in my throat. I did not have any shortness of breath, tachycardia,  rash or fever. I did not want to check in as a patient so I called my wife to come and pick me up from work. Before I left I had the pharmacy send me some Pepcid and Benadryl and I took 25mg of Benadryl and 20mg of Pepcid before leaving. I left work around 1400 and now at 1500 I am able to drink fluids. The slight lump in my throat seems to have improved. I still feel a little dizzy and off balance.

                                                After about 15 minutes, I began to feel lightheaded and experience a tingling in my arms/hands. I&#39;d guess it was related to the nerves in the arms, because it specifically affected my pinky and ring fingers on both hands. I was also unsteady on my feet, but did not lose consciousness. The lightheadedness and tingling continued off and on for most of the day. The tingling appeared to go away the next day, but I still experienced periodic (though rare) feelings of lightheadedness. Perhaps 2-3 time the next day (Saturday) and experienced maybe 1-2 times the following day (Sunday). I did not take Adderall on the weekend. On Monday, I did take Adderall and returned to work, where I experience some tingling again and longer bouts of lightheadedness. Again, I have not lost consciousness.

Slept all day. Went to bed in the evening and woke again at 3am shivering uncontrollably. Hands have continued to stay cold. No appetite as well.

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

                                                Severe dizziness started around 10:00pm then got a little better around 6 am the next day. Hardly got any sleep that night. Then around 8am I started to have chills which then I checked my temp and it was 101.0 degrees F. Then I started to get a headache and severe body aches. Around 3pm I tried to eat something which I then threw it up. I tried to drink water and flavored water which I also threw up the water. I also went into the bathtub 7 times that day to stop the chills. Which it did but right when I got out they started again which then I felt worse. Around 11pm 1/23/2021 I ended up going into the ER which then they gave me IV fluids and then Benadryl and Toradol by IV. After those were administered I started feeling better which then I was discharged and went home.

                                                It has been 6 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. For the first 3-4 days I had the usual moderate flu-like symptoms:  dizziness, headaches, fatigue, chills, soreness at vaccine siteetc.  Days 5-7 I seemed to gradually improve. On day 8 all of the symptoms returned with greater severity: this time I had a fever, the chills were much more intense, the headaches were excruciating, body and joint aches all over the place--I couldn&#39;t sleep or focus on anything cognitively taxing.  Interestingly, my brother, who was vaccinated just after me, also had more severe side effects beginning on day 8 post 2nd dose. He improved after 3-4 days, but my recovery has been much much lengthier. By day 14 I was still feeling very ill, though the fever did subside.  Sometime in the third week the pain in my arm at the vaccination site returned, then became intermittent, and still bothers me from time to time. I also started getting muscle spasms in the same exact locations that sent me to the ER after my probably bout with Covid in the spring of 2020. Thankfully these lasted only a week or so, though I began feeling muscle soreness in different parts of my body, ever changing. By the 4th week I was slightly better and down to 4 main symptoms: chills (by far the worst of the symptoms--to the point at which my skin would feel like it was being frostbitten by dry ice every time I changed sweaty clothes), occasional splitting headaches, and muscle soreness that included both the injection site on my arm and other areas.  I had other symptoms as well, fatigue and brain fog, etc, but these were present before the vaccination, though not as severe.

                                                A little less than 3 hours after getting the shot, I noticed the injection site was getting very sore. Within about a half hour of first noticing it, that entire muscle was aching a lot. It?s now 4:50pm and it hurts to lift my arm, reach for anything, I can even feel it just by typing this out. I?ve also noticed I?m pretty tired, my joints feel very achey like when I have a cold, and I?m incredibly thirsty. The pain in the muscle at injection site is by far the worst symptom though. It?s extremely painful. I did not expect that since it didn?t hurt when getting the actual shot. Took my temp and it?s normal. The aching joints are far less painful than my arm, but are an issue nonetheless. Had I known this would happen beforehand, I would still get the shot, so as long as it doesn?t get a lot worse or something else haplens, all in all I?d have to say it was worth it.

He told the pharmacist he was starting to feel funny and immediately fell on his back. I ran out to around the counter and he was conscious and sweaty. He was responsive, knew his name and where he was. He described feeling very hot. He did not have any rash or swelling visible.

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (hospitalized for 7 days; treated with Remdesivir; long recovery) from 11-Sep-2020 to October 2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure (ongoing issues) and Heart rate (ongoing issues).    On 05-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues). At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke), ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 9.64 after one round of the vaccine. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 220 natural antibodies after 2 months.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient reports that he had worked for an urgent care performing testing and contracted COVID-19 back in 11SEP2020. Patient was hospitalized for 7 days, was administered Remdesivir, and had a long recovery. Patient reports having issues regulating his blood pressure and heart rate so bad that he had almost died during that time. The recovery took up until 1st week of October and did not feel well until then. Patient reports it was advised to defer first dose of vaccination for COVID-19 for 3 months.   Patient self-medicated with OTC Tylenol and Advil which did not help. Patient reports that he was hospitalized a second time around last month (03MAR2021 approximately) for experiencing a stroke. Symptoms felt like he was experiencing a mini-COVID-19 episode and was having a relapse of COVID-19. ER professional advised patient to never take the second dose of the vaccine. Patient reports taking an antibody test (after a single dose of the vaccine) for both natural and for the spike protein on 25MAR2021. Patient reports that he had gotten a 9.64 reading from just one round of the vaccine in comparison to the doctors he had worked who had received both doses of the vaccine, never gotten sick with COVID-19, and produced a 9.0 reading. Patient reports his natural antibodies after 2 months was at 220. Patient wishes to report this information to highlight that his natural antibodies were so high from the previous COVID-19 infection that when he had gotten the first round of the vaccine, he believes that his body rejected the vaccine so strongly that he presented with severe side effects from the vaccine. Patient would like to submit his information to show that he is proof that if someone previously had COVID-19, they should only need a single dose of the vaccine. In addition, patient expressed that if a patient&#39;s natural antibody is high, then a reduced dose should be provided or the vaccine should be deferred until natural antibodies reduce   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 02-Apr-2021: Event details reported; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                I work at a Hospital sterilizing surgical equipment.  After I received the vaccine, the hospital staff observed me for 15 minutes to see if a reaction occurred.  I felt fine, and they told me I could go.  I was working that day (2-10:30pm) and had gotten vaccinated at the beginning of my shift.  The rest of my shift went fine.  Near the end, though, my arm began to feel sore.  Driving home, I began to feel tired.  By the time I got home, it felt like a cold was setting in.  I ate a large bowl of chicken soup to try to feel better.  I stayed up a little bit, but was feeling woozy by this point and went to bed.  Bad chills set in and I began to shake I felt so cold.  I used a heating pad to help with this.  I tried to sleep, but my head was throbbing.  The next morning, I tried to sit up in bed but my first attempt proved too difficult.  I took it slower.  I was able to sit up eventually.  Standing was also difficult.  I spent the day mostly lounging on the couch.  I slept a little better that night, but my head was still throbbing somewhat.  No chills this time.  Getting up the next morning went a little better.  I was able to sit up in bed without issue and walking around did not prove as much of a chore.

After observation for 4 hours I was feeling better, and was discharged home.   Ordered to take 40mg of steroids for 2 more days.  After one day post vaccination, I have significant pain at the site and body ache.

Laid down, rested, and felt better-- symptoms resolved and he was discharged to home. Noted to be hypertensive 143/93-- discussed with him and asked him to speak with primary care physician.

Patient was transferred into wheelchair and brought into an examination room with provider NP. Provider and staff collected vitals, blood sugars, and HPI.

Patient was with staff for well over one hour for observation, and symptoms resolved within 15 minutes of the initial onset without intervention. It was deemed likely vasovagal response by the provider.

                                                Around 11:30 pm that evening I started feeling extremely warm in my face and thighs. Figuring it was due to the shot, I decide to try and lay down to sleep it off. A short time later, I awoke freezing with chills and uncontrollable shivering. My whole body hurt especially my lower back and pressure in my head. This continued throughout the night until the early morning. As the shivering and chills subsided, extreme fatigue, body aches and head pressure continued and it was difficult to get up at points. I had no appetite and forced myself to drink to stay hydrated.  About 1:00 pm, I started to feel better, but that was short lived. Approximately 4:30 ? 5pm, the chills and shivering returned and I had 101 fever. I had some tea and toast and then went to bed for the night. When I awoke this morning, I felt a million times better. As of writing this email, I still have some slight fatigue, aches, and head pressure, but night and day difference from yesterday.

When I woke up at 5 Am I suffered from severe headache. Remainder of the day I had extreme digestive issues that continued over the next several days. At the conclusion of the second day I developed a fever of 101. Pinpointed severe pain developed at the base of my neck between my shoulder blades. That pain remained for approximately 24 to 48 hours that lead to extreme pain and stiff neck on my right side. Chills and periodic fever developed for two days past shot. By day three I had extreme right side neck pain that continued down into my right shoulder blade. By day four and five I suffered from extreme neck pain and severe headache that was focused from my right eye through my head down the right side of my neck to my right shoulder blade. By day 4 this continued with dizziness and blurred vision. I had inability to eat and strong feelings to vomit but only didn&#39;t because I hadn&#39;t consumed any food that day. I continued to suffer from extreme headaches and complete physical exhaustion with inability to stay away. In addition, I continued to have periodic chills but with no fever.  As I submit this in day 5 I still suffer from lack of energy and the stiff neck remains down through my right shoulder blade.

                                                Delayed reaction occurred 8 hrs. after receiving vaccine. Felt as if I was injected with the Flu, based on the symptoms that arose: chills, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, fever, body aches, weakness, no appetite or desire to hydrate(every single symptom was severe) These symptoms lasted 12 hrs. I chose to go in to work, instead of taking the day off. I truly believe that because I pushed my body through this painful ordeal, it helped me to overcome this Flu-like feeling that I endured for 12 hours: 10 of those at my job. I also experienced a swelling &amp; pain in my right knee. The pain &amp; swelling is finally subsiding as I type this report 4 days after the vaccine.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

                                                Within 2 min of injection, I walked out to waiting room felt tachycardic and dizzy.  I immediately informed pharmacist who took my BP.   BP first reading in left arm was 235/130 with a HR around 130. Second reading was 205/120 with HR in 120&#39;s about 4 min later.  I requested an ambulance due to the feeling of being very unwell and dizzy.  Trouble concentrating.    Ambulance ride was 190/112 ish EKG and BP monitoring at hospital.   No anaphalaxis diagnosed but unknown cause.   ER discharge after benadryl.    BP and HR would continue to cycle up and down for the next  18 hours.   Red spot formed about 2 inches away from where I was injected.      PCP and allergist thin it was an intravascular injection.

                                                3 minutes after vaccination the patient began to feel a tingling and pain in his arm where the vaccine was placed.  Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

                                                I received my first Covid-19 Moderna injection and felt slightly groggy and tired as the day progressed. Just before bed I noticed my arm was quite sore and I still felt tired and slightly light headed. The next day (Feb 4) I had a very sore left arm at the injection site but felt good otherwise. I came home from work and took one 200mg Ibuprofen as my arm was still quite sore. The following day (Feb 5) my arm pain subsided but I still felt light headed during the evening. I am writing this on Feb. 18th and each day I have bouts of being light headed and have difficulty concentrating. There is no real pattern to what time of day I get the symptoms. I do not have the classic headache but definitely feel pressure in my head and behind my eyes. I also find that I wake up after a full nights sleep and feel not well rested. I spoke with my doctor last week and he suggested I give it until this week to see where things are at. I plan on contacting him soon to schedule an appointment to discuss my symptoms more. Before getting the vaccine I did not have any of these symptoms as I describe.

I know exactly what happened because I&#39;ve had my other shoulder broken no less than three times. I know exactly what a shoulder socket full of fluid feels like. There is no discerible swelling it redness, and absolutely none of the bruise-like pain normally associated with any if the dozens of vaccinations a person gets throughout their lifetime. The pain is inside my shoulder and comes from trying to use my arm. It feels like my arm is going to come out if the socket if I so much as move my arm away from my body. If this person is doing this to other people then he needs to be stopped ASAP. No names were given. He is a shorter male, medium build, darker skin, (far as I could tell from the PPE), and spoke with a slight accent.

Paramedic checked on the patient, and patient was able to walk out the store on his own after 15 mins.

                                                I was driving on the highway and experienced numbness starting in my lips.  This numbness then moved throughout my body into my limbs.  I had some mobility and was able to pull off of the highway down an exit but at one point, I could not lift my legs or control my hands.  I called 911 but it was very difficult to do so with the numbness.  I then started to regain my mobility but had some continued numbness around the left side of my mouth.  The paramedics tested my vitals and everything came back as normal.    They recommended that I have someone come pick me up. So I had a neighbor come pick me up and someone drive my car home.  I did not lose any vision or mental capacity throughout this.  It was just a wave of numbness throughout my entire body.  It lasted 5-10 minutes but felt like an eternity. I am lucky to be alive and to not have crashed my vehicle into someone or something.

                                                Day after the vaccine I awoke with a very sore left arm which was to be expected.  Upon moving I experienced vertigo, dizziness, headache, and extreme pressure in the left side of my face to include sinus cavities and deep inner ear pressure.  I had some episodes of loose stools, not diarrhea, but not formed stools.  These symptoms still persist to today, 1/15/2021, except for loose stool, that has returned to normal.  I had a Dr. appointment today and the doctor would not rule out post vaccine side effects.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

                                                Within 48 hours of receiving the COVID vaccine, I began having extreme pressure and discomfort in my right ear.  Symptoms included dizziness, fullness in the ear and hearing loss.  This persisted for several days.  As a first course of action, I took Tylenol and antihistamines.   I saw my PCP a few days later and he misdiagnosed my condition and suggested that I continue with antihistamines and Flonase.  Two weeks later my condition had improved only slightly and I became more concerned.  I asked my PCP whether a short course of steroids was warranted (at the suggestion of my mom and wife, who are both health care professionals).  He prescribed a &#34;dose pack,&#34; which I started on or about Monday, Feb. 22.  Later that week, I connected with an ENT  who is a friend of a friend .  When I told him my story and symptoms he was extremely concerned and got me an immediate appointment on Friday, Feb. 26.  At that visit I was diagnosed with acute and severe Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that had resulted in 92% hearing loss in my right ear.   Additional symptoms continue to include fullness, tinnitus and other discomfort.  None of these issues existed prior to my COVID vaccine shot.  I am currently undergoing a treatment of high dose prednisone and steroid injections in my ear.   I am scheduled for another visit with doctor on Friday, March 12.

                                                After 24 hours, I started having body aches, that night couldn&#39;t sleep I took Ibuprofen it helped, over the weekend I kept taking Ibuprofen. Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

I walked into the bedroom and layed back down on the bed still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. after what felt like a few minutes, I began Heaving like I was going to throw up but I felt like it was a dream and was very slow to react until my girlfriend told me to run to the bathroom. the whole time I was coughing up a foam.

                                                Received Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday (1/6) at 8:10 am. After about 3 hours, began to experience dizziness, nausea and fatigue that progressively worsened throughout the day. Went home after work, fell asleep and did not eat dinner due to lack of appetite from nausea and dizziness. Woke up in AM following day (1/7), feeling somewhat better, but still slightly dizzy. Appetite has returned and was able to eat regular meals today.

I began to sweat a little and have minor tachycardia.  I never went back into the clinic but instead leaned the seat of my car back and those symptoms went away after about 30 minutes.  I never experienced any symptoms after that.

                                                After the first day there was the typical site injection pain. Three Tylenol on the next day seem to take care of that but the pain quickly moved to the Front and top of the right pelvic bone. No amount of Tylenol has seem to do anything with that pain. After a week it seem to start to migrate to the left front top pelvic bone. These symptoms were mild and I was still able to carry out my daily activities in law-enforcement.  Friday night January 22 is when I started to have pulsating pressure in the back of my head, chills, dizziness, excessive urination, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. The symptoms have persisted through today but are starting to ease. I took a COVID-19 test on Sunday, January 24 the results came back today as Covid negative.

Has had two events of nausea and headache on other days in the past two weeks since vaccine but doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s related to the vaccine.  States that events have gotten better over time.

I had stopped moving to rearrange some items. While stopped, I started to feel lightheaded, develop tunnel vision, and feel faint, almost to the point of blacking out. I put my head down and legs up and felt somewhat better. I then attempted to return to my car. I could go 100-200 yards at a stretch, before having to purposefully fall down and elevate my legs. I traveled the mile back to my car like this (slowly). I could not check my pulse because my hands were too cold; my respiration rate was elevated. At the car, I drank fluids and warmed up and began to recover enough to get home.

He reported he went to his primary care provider later that afternoon.  He was examined clinically and was told that the shot was administered too high up in his arm in the Gleno Humeral Joint.  He was advised to take over the counter pain medication and to call if he needs something stronger.  He was given a follow up appointment on 2/5/2021 with the provider. He was told to monitor for infection in the next 48 hours and they are hoping it did not go into the joint capsule.  Continued to have severe pain.  Went to orthopedic specialist the next day.  Admitted to hospital for pain control and steroids.  MRI of shoulder inconclusive, but think severe bursitis and being treated as such.  Discharged from hospital and resting at home.  Arm range of motion at 80%-hoping to return to work in 2 weeks (firefighter/EMT).

On 04 Feb 2021, on the same day as the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 030L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 04 Feb 2021, a couple of hours after the vaccination, the patient couldn&#39;t feel his arm and he had no range in motion.  He also had pain in his upper shoulder area by his neck.

                                                I experienced what I would describe as a cardiac event. My heart started racing out of no where. I have an activity tracking device and it was pacing me at 184 bbm for thirty minutes then a subsidence to 120 bbm for the next couple hours. By the evening my heart rate had decreased to the 70 - 80 ish range.  Sleep time and the following morning it was what I would consider normal. This event made me dizzy and my skin paled. I was also very tired. It was as if I had done an intense cardio workout with no warm up. 0 to max. I didn&#39;t seek medical attention but did consider it.

I got up to use the bathroom and had a syncopal episode about halfway to bathroom. Fell and i came to immediately when my name was called.  I got back into bed.  My lips were white.  I still felt lightheaded but could breathe freely and easily.  There was no noticeable swelling impairing my breathing.  Initially i could not get a reading on my pulse oximeter.  After a few minutes it worked and by then i was at 95%. I suspect the oxygen was quite low prior to that.  For the next day i had a fever and farigue.  The day after that I had some lingering fatigue but no fever.  Right now I am not planning to get the second shot in the series.

Pharmacist and another associate helped patient up who was conscious. He asked what happened and if he were standing.  He shared that everything went pitch black.  He was placed on chair; pharmacist asked if he wouldl like to lie down and he declined. He stated he had felt nervous and scared about imz before his appointment. Patient did cut his lip in fall and was given napkins for bleeding and a cold compress for face and neck. Patient waited with us for 2 hours. His BP was 154-74 and pulse of 54 ; patient stated he was a runner with low pulse. Patient arranged for a ride from family member since he lived far and was not sure about driving. I recommend that he place a call in with his provider.

                                                I have had a low grade fever (99.5)  for a week now.  I have had insomnia since the night of the injection.  EVERY night I wake up hot 3 hours after I went to sleep.  I have never gotten the chills, only hot.   I usually need to take a sleep aid to get back to sleep which is NOT normal for me.   Many times I wake up again 3 hours later even after the sleep aid hot.   My lack of sleep has really been hard on my daytime working and living at this point.  When I wake at night hot my temperature is usually 99.5, but has been a bit lower at times too.   I also feel that I have rapid heart rate at this time (when I try to fall back asleep)  and it seems as if my heart is beating harder than normal.  I also feel a buzzing in my head like I drank too much coffee type of feeling.  The first couple of days I felt tired and weak and a bit achy throughout the day.  The next few days after that I felt dizzy and light headed with a headache.  The first few days I also noticed slight muscle spasms throughout my arms and torso particularly when I laid down at night to go to bed and was still and relaxed.  I have been taking over the counter pain/fever pills usually for the headache.  I contacted my doctor and he said to give it a week.  It has been a week yesterday, but Dr is closed for weekends and Fridays.  I went to urgent care on Friday and they were not helpful (virtually).  They said give it 5 more days!!!!!   I am extremely tired of this and worried at how long it has been.  NOBODY I know with the first shot has had this reaction.  My wife is nervous as well and we would really like to hear something that may ease our minds at this point.  Some explanation as to why my body may be reacting this way, or if any others have had this same situation.

                                                I was feeling cold throughout the day, at about 9:00 pm I took a shower to try to get warmed up, I just kept getting colder and colder until I was severely shaking uncontrollably. Every muscle was so tense and I was shaking so badly I could barely walk or breathe. I went to the bedroom and got under blankets with a heater and in a few minutes the shaking diminished to where I could start breathing normal again. It took about an hour before my shakiness went away completely but I still needed to stay under the blankets and near the heater as I felt I was still cold and on the verge of getting the severe chills again. I had no fever. Next morning (as I&#39;m writing) I&#39;m still worried about getting out of bed as I still don&#39;t feel right and am scared of getting the chills like that again.

I was seated at the time, waiting the 15 minutes for observation after the shot, symptoms happened about 10 minutes into the waiting period.  I was given some cold water right away, over the next 10 minutes my vision started coming back and I stopped sweating. Was told I looked flush when they first came over but was looking much better after another 10 mins.   I stayed an additional 30 minutes for observation after the event and had friends come take me home and get my car. I&#39;m still feeling very slightly light headed and somewhat tired 2 days later, but otherwise feeling great.

                                                On 3/16/21, I noticed a rash which closely mirrors what is being described as &#34;COVID arm&#34; at the site of the injection.  This appeared after 72 hours of severe stomach pain and loose stool, combined with fatigue, dizziness, chills/hot spells and lack of appetite.  There has been no fever with any of these symptoms.  The other members of my family who live in my household (Spouse - who also has had one dose of the Moderna vaccine, and our children age 12 and 15) all experienced the same set of symptoms, except the rash at site of vaccine injection.  I thought we had all caught a stomach bug from each other, but now I wonder if my symptoms were related to the rash that I first noticed this morning.

                                                I received my Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination at approximately 0800 am on February 10, 2021. At approximately 1800 hrs the same day, I experienced a sudden onset of muscle spasms to my lower back. I was at rest, sitting in a chair at the time of onset. The muscle spasm to my lower back was extremely intense and I had difficulty walking. This continued for about 1.5 hours. Also, during this time, I experienced cramping to the arches of both my feet. This was intermittent. I also had pain/soreness to my hips bilaterally. After approximately 1.5 hours the lower back spasms and cramping to my feet subsided.  I do not have a history of lower back issues and this is my first experience of spasms of my lower back.

                                                About 6 minutes after a got first shot of moderna, I had felt fin. Then within 20-30 seconds I realized that my chest was heavy/pressure on my sternum, arms and torso went warm and sweaty, a bit light headed and had fast heart rate. I asked medical team for assistance. They took blood pressure/O2 levels and listen to my heart and lungs. Had epi pen ready, but never administered. Watched me like this for about hour and a half until my bp came back down to normal levels.

These feelings lasted until 10pm on 1/16/21, and then I went to bed and felt better in the morning.  I was barely able to get out of bed that day (1/16) because of how sick I felt.  Besides the sick feeling,  I had bad pain at the injection site, and had a 3cm x 3cm raised red lump at the injection site.  This stayed painful for 48-60 hours, then the swelling subsided and was left with a bruise.

Patient was observed 1801-1830 in vaccination observation area.  He was placed in the given water and then placed recumbent position.  There was no change.  He did improve with juice PO.  DR was notified and does not think this is an anaphylactic reaction, but should be transferred to the ED for further evaluation.  Patient was transferred to the ED.

Interferes with sleep, regardless of position (&amp; unable to lie on left side).  Unable to elevate shoulder overhead into flexion or abduction d/t pain (limited to ~45 degrees).  Tenderness over lateral shoulder/SIT tendons.  Positive impingement sign.  Seems to be tendon/shoulder injury d/t faulty injection technique.  I had minimal shoulder soreness after the first injection.

                                                Since receiving Moderna shot #1 vaccine I have experienced three gout attacks. It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

                                                About 3-5 minutes after getting the vaccine began experiencing a light headedness feeling. Took my blood pressure and it was a little high (140/95), I attributed this to anxiety but got home and my BP at home was down to about 120/76 about 1 hr. after. I laid down to sleep it off but could not sleep as about 1 hr. after trying to go to sleep I started to get a headache. After about 2 hours of battling it I decided to take a Extra Strength Tylenol which helped with the headache about 2 hrs later is was almost gone but the feeling of lightheadedness/dizziness was still there a bit worse than at the beginning. I slept it off and the next morning it was about 50 % better and by about noon it seemed to be 99% better. Today is Thursday ( on my 3rd day) and still feel a slight dizziness but I also have seasonal allergies which sometimes give me the same symptoms. I expect to be better soon.

I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

Nest day woke up with severe pain in left arm from below the site of injection (upper triceps) region down to the elbow , got severe enough to not be able straighten my arm fully without major discomfort.  Took Advil 800 mg , that made it better but not completely. By evening time felt like i was tired and like what i feel like when i am about to get a cold.   Next day was not tired , feeling of getting sick was no longer there and pain got slightly better by midday.   Next day after that woke up with slight swelling in the site and the arm was red and was warm to touch.  That continued for 2 days and gradually got less red and swollen and started to itch.  Took almost a week for the itch to completely subside.

                                                I had my second injection on Sunday morning 1/24/21 at 9:00 AM.  I was fine through the day.  The previous dose (dose #1) was on 12/29/20 and I became symptomatic the following day.  I had aches, malaise and fevers of 102.7 on 12/30/20.  The fevers lasted approximately 12 hours and resolved with Tylenol.  My left deltoid was very swollen and quite painful.  The swelling and pain resolved within 24 hours after the first injection.  Prior to dose #2 and through the day on 1/24, I used Tylenol and Celebrex, both medications were ingested at 8:45 and the tylenol wa again ingested at 11pm prior to going yo bed.

I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence.

                                                Been having rapid heart rate and elevated blood pressure on and off for four days.  Ten min after the first and ONLY shot, it felt like a rush and they brought me to the next room, checked my BP and HR.  177/111 and 115 bpm.  Got better after a bit, and went home. 28 hours later, my heart started racing at home, drove to the WR and it was 133-145 Beats and BP was 180-120.    Went to the ER again tonight for being light headed,  did the EKG and it was normal.  Tonight I woke up three times with a heart rate of 90

I woke up I believe in the early morning hours a couple of days later in pain.  The pain caused me to wake up.  After that I noticed that my elbow joints, and knee joints were very sore.  I was unable to flex my arms (mainly right arm) or knees (mainly right knee) after that for approximately two weeks without feeling pain.  Extremely sore joints starting in arm/elbow joint followed by extremely sore knee joints.  Overall body aches mainly in joints.  Persists to the time of this writing

                                                Started with tiredness, then arm got sore and was painful to lift. Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

While I do report my daily progress on V-SAFE it does not allow for detailed reporting and it does not have a radio button for hot flashes that WILL NOT GO AWAY.    Approx 30-60 min after the vaccine I did get a headache which has continued (still have it).  I did get dizziness and fatigue which has somewhat subsisted and has gotten better (comes and goes) but the headache remains and now I have hot flashes that came out of nowhere last night.  It continues with the headache.    Nothing has changed from my routine nor have I been around anyone new or traveled recently.

                                                My arm was sore for 3 days as though I had been punched really hard.  After that  my deltoid became incredibly irritated and I started having stabbing, excruciating pain in my should any time it moved.  This lasted until I went in to get a shot of local anaesthetic from my doctor  on 2/25/21.  I was taking advil, tylenol, a muscle relaxer, lydecane cream and then I got the shot of anaesthetic.  I slowly had a little bit of improvement in mobility.  13 days after my vaccine, I was no longer experiencing shooting pain in my shoulder.  It is now March 1st and I think I have regained about 70% of my  mobility in that arm.  I believe that the shot made my deltoid flex and freak out and this ended up causing bicep tendinitis.  This is also my doctor&#39;s theory.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the shot, I began to feel flu-like symptoms beginning with intestinal discomfort and incontinence. Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

                                                Injection administered on 1/4/21 and was given in upper left shoulder joint opposed to the deltoid muscle. I completely removed my shirt to assure proper placement.  Common soreness to shot experienced next two days after administration, however soreness felt in shoulder joint rather than muscle. Pain re-occurred on 1/12/21 and has not been totally relieved despite the usage of anti-inflammatory medication eg. Ibuprofen 400mg,  Tylenol 500mg along with Ibuprofen for soreness. The worst pain I experience is when I go to sleep being prematurely awaken by aching and throbbing to my affected area. Again, not being any discomfort to muscle but rather left shoulder joint pain where sometimes I am discouraged from raising my left arm to my side. It does not bother me so much to raise my left arm towards my front. I have been working through my discomfort while being very careful not to aggravating it further. My concern comes from the fact that it has not completely gone away after the extended time frame and becomes more intense in the evening.

Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

                                                On 12 FEB 2021 I received my first dosage of the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine, Lot 016M20A. On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back. In the evening of 13 FEB it was noted that the pain in the left hip became more generalize:d vice the specific point pain that I have witnessed off/on since SEP 2020.  Continued to note evening pain that felt like burning/tingling pain on both feet.  At this point the pain in the evenings appeared to be worse than the AM pain.   Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 It should be noted, that left shoulder discomfort from the injection never exceed 2/10 as it appeared 24 hours after the injection.  More pain in shoulder associated with mobility/rotation? I lacked the ability to simply walk through the house due to the pain throughout the past 36 hours.   14 FEB: Less discomfort in AM, but still greatest in left foot. Left Foot: 7/10 Fight foot: 4/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 3/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 4/10 PM:  Significant increase in pain at bed time. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 15 FEB: AM: continued lessening of pain/discomfort in AM, but appeared back throughout the day, worsening at evening.  Pain in left hip was noted to be much more pronounced shooting out in multiple directions, to include causing discomfort from the rear of the hip, and when seated shooting pain in the direction of my inner thigh from the back of my hip.  Pain in feet continues to be like a burning/tingling pain in the evening, most pronounced in 2nd and 3rd toes on my left foot and big toe and little toe on my right foot.  The pain also appears to be much greater at evening than in AM. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: Left Hip 8/10 right hip 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10-not much change-very point specific pain.. I am not witnessing fatigue or any other problems other than joint/musco skeletal pain.  I have also not been getting shooting pain in feet that has appeared from time to time which feels like someone hammering nails into individual toes or shots of violent pain, only a sustained burning/tingling pain. four days later the Psoriatic Arthritis locations continue to rage following the vaccine, most notably bilateral feet and left hip, where the pain in the hip appears to be radiating in multiple directions.

On second night after receiving the vaccine, I had severe headaches and alternating chills/sweats.   72hrs after the vaccine,  pain continues, although it has subsided to the point where almost full motion is possible.  Periodic severe headaches continue, although these existed before receiving the vaccine and are linked to positive COVID in Nov 2020.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

                                                Severe shaking to the point I could barely walk, talk, or function in general. In fact, had to end work conference call due to effects.  In desperation, I have my wife help me into a hot shower where I continued to shake violently for about 25 minutes.  My wife continued to monitor me to make sure I didn&#39;t collapse or pass out and continually ask if we should go to the ER.  However, after about 25 minutes the shaking subsided and I was left exhausted with some minor muscle pain due to shaking.  It was very difficult to breath during the incident, noticed my hands turning blue so I focused on deep breaths and staying calm to eventually stop it.

                                                Injection was painless.   Within 5 minutes of vaccine felt dizzy and had heart rate into the 120&#39;s.  Duration approximately 5 minutes then tachycardia and dizziness resolved.  Also had a tremor.  No angioedema, urticaria or other skin/mucosal findings.  Was not anxious.  Arrived home and wife and children told me I looked flushed and noticed my pupils were significantly dilated.  The flushing and dilated pupils resolved over the next hour.  No shortness of breath or hoarse voice of any kind however my mouth felt extremely dry.  I did not do anything for treatment.  Spontaneous resolution.

The fever broke after about 5 hours with 800mg of ibuprofen and 1000mg of acetaminophen. The nausea subsided somewhat with 8mg of Zofran sublingual. The headache resolved about 01:00am on 01/10/2021. The dizziness and fatigue resolved significantly by 04:00am on 01/10/2021. Mild fatigue continued for another 24 or so hours, but seemed mostly resolved by 01/11/2021 and may have been exacerbated by my overnight (7p-7a) shifts.

                                                Post shot developed the following within hours:  head congestion, dizziness, nausea, brain fogginess, phlegm in my heart, headache, inability to fully concentrate to typical ability, major soreness in arm receiving shot, soreness developed in arm that didn&#39;t receive the shot with intermittent shooting pain at opposite arm shot sight as if being stabbed with a knife.  Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

Left arm swelled up to the size of a goose egg and I was unable to lift my left arm from my left side.  Low grade fever, body aches, eyes looked sunken in, felt exhausted. I felt like I had the flu. I missed three days of work after the second dose.    I took ibuprofen and iced the left arm and rested.  I never had a reaction to the influenza vaccination in forty years.  The first dose, I did not miss work. And the side effects went away the next day.

Was monitored for another 30 minutes and my wife picked me up. Took tylenol when I got home. Checked blood sugar at home and blood sugar was down to 40. I hadn&#39;t eaten before the vaccine. I ate oatmeal and went to bed. After 2 hours, I no longer had symptoms. Returned to work 1/29/2021 without any further issues.

                                                7pm on date of injection I got very sleepy and fell asleep.  I woke up at 12:45am sweating but chilled to the bone.  I felt feverish but was too cold to get out of bed.  When I actually got out of bed I had a very intense headache, and body aches.  I took my temp and it registered 104.  at 8am I took my dogs out but felt very old, chilled to the bone &amp;  lightheaded.  It was chilly outside.  I got back inside and got back into bed as fast as I could. The second I laid down, the sweat just poured out of my body, drenching my shirt, sheets, and blanket.  The fever lasted all day but was slowly improving throughout the day.  My arm was also incredibly sore at the injection site.  It was very sore for shot one too but the pain lasted nearly 2 weeks the first time and is already just about gone now.  Yesterday, or 2 days after dose 2 injection, the fever was gone.  I still had a headache, and body aches but also developed nausea.  I did not vomit but I did have diarrhea.  I also noticed extreme shortness of breath over very minor exertion.  I?m not sure if this was due to extreme dehydration , due to loss of fluids or if it?s associated with the vaccine.  My lungs feel clear and I deny ever suffering from a bronchial spasms..  Day 3 I?m feeling more myself but am still suffering from gastric upset.  Nausea has dissipated.

                                                Immediately after receiving 1st dose of moderna my arm began to have a burning sensation and become sore. The burning sensation expanded to my left armpit area over the next few hours and extended to left side of chest. It felt like streaks of burn extending out of armpit area.  Approximately 12hrs after receiving the shot (3am) I became extremely nauseated. I alternated between throwing up and diarrhea for the next three hours. During this time i also experienced a fever, chills, sweats, uncontrollable shaking and elevated heart rate. Today (3/19) I am dehydrated, lightheaded and dizzy. fever and chills are gone as well as nausea but heart rate is still elevated.

                                                I don&#39;t think that my reaction to the vaccine is super serious but it is perhaps worth noting if others are also experiencing similar symptoms. On the second day, I did have the expected arm soreness around the injection area on my right arm. That soreness faded by Saturday morning. However, on Saturday afternoon, I began experiencing some intermittent pain in my left kidney. I have had a few (3?) kidney stones since I was approximately 35 years old so it is a pain that I recognize almost immediately.  I kept my spider senses awake to see where it was going to go. About an hour later, I had intermittent &#34;flu like&#34; pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn&#39;t seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out. I cannot 100% say that any of these symptoms are related to the vaccine. However, being a Type 1 diabetic (since 1978) and the unusual kidney pain made me go, &#34;huh.&#34; That is why I am providing this info in the event that there are others who are experiencing similar symptoms that can be tied to the vaccine and what to expect. I feel completely fine now. Yay. :)

                                                Aches and stiffness in the joints. Muscle aches. At the outset I was barely able to walk very slowly around my apartment.  Couldn&#39;t stay on my feet longer than a couple of minutes. It got  less severe with time, but not very fast. I was able to take a walk outside again for the first time 6 days after the shot. Today, a week after the shot, my knees still hurt, and I still don&#39;t feel like I can run.

                                                After I got the shot, on the way home, I started feeling tingling on tongue and lips; had a metallic taste. I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

I had a sore arm for 2 days, but just a dull pain right after the shot. 3. I was fine for the past week but then 8 days after my shot, my arm got a small red rash at the injection site, it was itchy, and a little sore - I got the so called &#34;Covid arm&#34; or &#34;Moderna arm&#34;.  It came out of nowhere.

                                                I experience similar symptoms I had after being diagnosed with a positive test.  The symptoms included pain around waist area, pain in muscle joints, sleepiness and inability to walk steadily.  I ended up going back to bed and the symptoms subsided.  I reported this because I think others may experience the same.

                                                50 year old male with history of allergic rhinitis, currently on AIT, presents for follow up. Since last seen he initiated AIT in December 2020 and reports he had tolerated his AIT injections without large local or systemic reactions until yesterday, 16 Mar, when he received his first maintenance dose. Within minutes of receiving his dose he developed shortness of breath, dizziness/altered level of consciousness resulting in collapse, and was noted to be hypoxic. He was treated with IM epinephrine with initial improvement but subsequently again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness. He received his second dose of IM epinephrine and a dose of IM Benadryl with transient improvement, but again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness followed by nausea and vomiting. He was noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic despite these interventions so a third dose of IM epinephrine and IV fluids were administered. He was transferred by ambulance to ER where he was given IV solumedrol, monitored, and admitted to the ICU overnight for observation. He reports fever (Tmax 101 F) last night in the ICU. He endorses he took his Allegra prior to his AIT dose and did not exercise. Of note, on 15 Mar he received his second mRNA COVID19 vaccine.

He then developed neck pain, tingling that goes into right and left arms/fingers. Was started on oral steroids by his PCP on 4/6/21. Given worsening symptoms and new development of urinary retention. Patient was admitted to Hospital 4/8-4/11. Suspected to have cervical transverse myelitis.  Re-admitted 4/12 due to worsening generalized weakness, significant numbness, gait/coordination issues, and several falls. Differential diagnosis includes guillain barre syndrome vs. transverse myelitis. No MS on brain MRI. No cord lesion. Treatment included IVIG 0.5g/kg daily x 4 days, B12, 1 mg IM daily x 3 days. bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  4/7: MRI cervical spine: Small focal area of increased T2 signal within the central cervical cord at the C2 level without associated postcontrast enhancement. A demyelinating disease is leading differential consideration. 4/11: MRI brain: normal, no de-myelinating disease; MRI C-spine: severe cervical stenosis with flattening of spinal cord but no cord edema/enhancement.

                                                This is a 50-year-old male who got his first Covid vaccine last Thursday, April 8 and then he said on Saturday he began to feel weak and off balance.  He also began to feel tremulous.  He apparently said that on Saturday his right leg was shaking so bad he could hardly walk.  He denies any numbness but again feels off balance.  He has fallen down several times since Saturday.  He apparently went to urgent care and then was sent to the emergency department for evaluation.  His blood pressure was noted to be 194/130 on presentation.  He does have an obvious tremor in his left arm.  His significant other says that he at times had slurred his words.  The patient does not know what type of vaccine he received on April 8.  The patient due to these symptoms presents to the emergency department now for evaluation.  He apparently drinks about 8 to 10 cans of beer per day and has done so for an extended period.  He denies any loss of vision.  Patient was not a candidate for alteplase.  He was admitted on 4/12 and discharged on 4/14. Discharge medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and losartan.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                Right after the vaccine I just had a slight head ache. I had pretty typical symptoms. Around 8pm my arm got to 8/10 pain. I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

                                                Drank fluids around 8pm followed by unusually early fatigue and somnolence 2 hours early, awoke before midnight cold, shivering, aching in larger muscles and joints from neck to ankle including shoulders, back, hips, and thighs, could not get warm wearing many layers and blankets, then headache after 3am with hot dry sore throat and awoke more short of breath than usual, eyes crusted, slightly dizzy on rising, am finding myself with poor attention this morning filling out this form incorrectly needing more corrections than usual.  The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

                                                I don&#39;t have lot number or dose number.  It was a Moderna COVID 19 vaccine.  I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

Patient was breathing but unresponsive, stiff, and unable to blink, talk, or move for around 2-3 minutes.  Once the seizure ended I asked patient if he had a history of seizures, his answer was, &#34;not really&#34;. He drank some of the water and sat with the ice pack for a couple minutes and said he felt better. Color returned. Patient stated he felt nerves contributed more than anything and was feeling 100% better when he left. We had dialed 911 while patient was unresponsive but once he was able to talk again he declined 911 and stated feeling much better.

Personnel took me to observation, my blood pressure jumped up to 204, my heart bit to 190, felt like that for 15 minutes, then my BP started to come down. They called an ambulance took me to the hospital, in the ambulance my BP came down to 170. Go to the ER, blood test ok, after two hours there BP came down to 130 they released me. FYI, 51 year old man, very active, I can run a marathon (26.1 miles) in 3:45, Im not diabetic, I dont take any medication, I dont have high blood pressure. Dont know what that  happened, no insurance, now waiting for a bill from the hospital, not to mention Im scared to death now taking the second dose.

I was only able to lift my arm above my head with assistance from my right arm. Eventually I was able to lift my arm without assistance and the same phenomena happened the third evening where my shoulder was frozen and immobilized.  The frozen shoulder has abated but there is still moving poi&#39;s of major swelling in the upper arm. There has been persistent but slowly abating symptoms of deep soreness, arm weakness and weak grip strength. Swelling persists in the upper front portion of left shoulder. I can not do extended tasks with the arm because it does not have strength nor stamina.

Degree of vertigo strong for entire first day undeniably present/persistent and varies (slightly improved, then worsens again) since day 8. Able to get through day but disturbing. Extremely healthy otherwise,  extremely athletically capable.  Nothing unusual in diet or sleep or activity or stress in recent days.  SYMPTOM 2 - Ringing ears on day 11, and increasing on day 12.  This too - never before of any significance in entire life.  Could it be related to the vertigo symptoms?  Feels like it is.  *** Please take note! *** Hard to dismiss as unrelated.  I&#39;m just one.  You have the sample data.  Seems as though auditory/balance nerves are getting a beating somehow.  This is NOT an exasperated pre-existing condition.  The shoulder soreness / tiredness - was a 1 day matter quickly resolved.  This is more insidious and persistent and debilitating.

By the following morning, I felt that skin area, as well as the area around both of my eyes to feel as if I had sustained second degree burns. Additionally, the skin around my eyes particularly, presented with extreme dryness and geriatric symptoms, such as wrinkling and streched thinned skin, as if I were an elderly person (over 75 years old, and not 52).  The flaring/burning subsided after 4-5 days. However, the skin dryness around the eyes has persisted to this day (i.e. 5 weeks past the 1st vaccination). A day after the 2nd part of the vaccination, I felt moderate dizziness and headache, which lasted for about 24 hours. Also, light soreness and skin stiffening were experienced at the arm location where the shot was adminmistered.

Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Open heart surgery. Concomitant products included POTASSIUM, FUROSEMIDE (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]), WARFARIN, METOPROLOL SUCCINATE (TOPROL XL), MINERALS NOS, VITAMINS NOS (PRENATAL VITAMINS [MINERALS NOS;VITAMINS NOS]), CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) and ESCITALOPRAM OXALATE (LEXAPRO) for an unknown indication.    On 11-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required), VERTIGO (Room spinning) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required). The patient was hospitalized from 19-Mar-2021 to 21-Mar-2021 due to TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. On 21-Mar-2021, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack), VERTIGO (Room spinning) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient received vaccine in right non-dominate deltoid muscle to prevent COVID-19. Patient was admitted to hospital from 19Mar2021 to 21Mar2021 for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scan, with observation and Low-Dose Aspirin. Patient was feeling much better and his cardiologist recommended that he receives his second Moderna vaccine as soon as required and to take an extra Vitamin D supplement as a precaution. Scheduled second dose was due on 08Apr2021. Treatment included was low dose aspirin.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

CT scans were inconclusive so I was transferred (9:45 PM 2/25/21), admitted and an MRI scheduled for 24 hours later. MRI (12:00 AM 2/27/21) was negative for stroke. Beginning stages of Bells Palsy was diagnosed. Prescribed Prednisone, Lipitor, Valtrex,  and baby aspirin upon discharge 1:45 PM 2/27/21).  By 2/28/21  symptoms had increased to the point where I can not suck through a straw, speaking is difficult and overall, extreme loss of muscle control in my face and feel like I have a bad head cold.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

Had to use my right hand to move my left hand. The experience was comparable to what is described as &#34;falling asleep&#34; , the exception is that there was no tingling sensation. This lasted for approximately 5 minutes. Upon getting out of bed this followed by approx. 2-3 minutes of light headedness. Joints in both elbows and wrists are sore, more so on the left side.

Day 14 developed bad right sciatical pain that lasted 1 day and resolved on its own. 4.  Day 21 developed restless leg syndrome x 1 day and resolved on its own 5.   Day 25  developed severe body trembling  arms andl egs and severe anxiety at night, I could not sleep x 2 nights. 6.   Day 32 developed  a very faint inner tremor that I feel when I get out of bed.

On the morning of March 12, 2021 I had a serious case of vertigo and had to be transported to hospital.  The event lasted several hours and I was admitted overnight for observation.  The problem corrected itself within 12-18 hours.  I have had no follow-up  occurrences.  The episode occurred less than 10 days after my first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine shot.  I cannot confirm that the event was the result of a side effect, but I have never had vertigo before an all other heart, MRI, and CAT scans eliminated all common causes of vertigo.  An ENT doctor did not note any inner ear problem.  I don&#39;t know if this was a side effect, coincidence, or something unrelated, but wanted to report it just  in case.

                                                At 5 days post vaccination, patient developed severe left shoulder pain, originally thought to be secondary to chronic shoulder pain and a recent fall, over the next three days it progressed to swelling, severe pain, and limited ROM. He ended up being admitted to the hospital and CT scan showed development of significant soft tissue infiltration around sternum and sternoclavicular joints. This was originally thought to be infectious, but he never developed a fever or leukocytosis and we feel this was most likely an inflammatory process. I have no idea if this was actually a vaccine side effect, but given the proximity in both time a location and the known complication of shoulder pain with the vaccine, it seems reasonable to give you the information to monitor for other similar cases.

Noticed that when my arm is to the side of my body, it started going numb- right arm. I also had to get up around 4 times to urinate a lot. I was getting night sweats. When I would get up, I had a slight head ache and dizziness. I still have it right now, the headache and dizziness. Even when I walk, I have to extend my pinky finger out so my arm will not go numb. As we are speaking right now, my pinky finger is going numb. Once I extend it out, it goes away, but when I put it down by my side, it goes numb. My whole body is sore as well.

                                                Presented to ED for evaluation of generalized lower extremity weakness, falls. The patient states that he carries a diagnosis of MS and typically is fully functioning without assistance of a cane or walker. The patient states that yesterday morning around 0900 he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was otherwise feeling fine but by last night (12 hours after the vaccine) the patient states he tried to get out of bed and was transferring when he felt his bilateral legs give out, causing him to slide to the ground. His wife then came to help and states that the patient was completely weak in the legs, and was unable to even lift his legs up to get back into bed. They then tried to walk him again a short time later and he again stumbled with weakness in his legs. Since that time, the patient states he has been minimally ambulatory and has been using a cane, but still needs large assistance to get around his home. The patient states he has baseline foot drop but feels this is worse in his legs today. He went to clinic this morning for his symptoms where he was noted to have an elevated temperature and was diffusely weak in his lower extremities. Given this, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies any weakness in his upper extremities or facial asymmetry. He denies sensation change in his extremities nor any recent illness such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or leg pain. He has no history of stroke. He denies any injuries or head injury, syncope from his falls. He was admitted to the hospital where he will receive further symptomatic treatment as necessary. No treatment provided in emergency department for weakness.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included dolutegravir sodium;lamivudine, pregabalin, and modafinil for unknown indication.  On 19 Feb 2021, approximately two days prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 011M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Feb 2021, after receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt unusually tired for midafternoon that day. The patient had suffered from chronic fatigue issues but never felt more tired than usual at that point in the day. The patient then experienced a black out and woke up face down with a bloody nose and head. The patient felt very dizzy, was not able to walk and crawled to their mattress and fell asleep. The patient managed to get himself to the Emergency room, a CT scan of the head was performed, and it was revealed that the patient had a fracture that had occurred before the vaccine and was not related to the vaccine. The doctor thought the vaccine however maybe related to the blackout or have exaggerated a concussion and have caused these delayed symptoms. No treatment information was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the event experienced a black out was resolved at the time of this report and the outcome of the events, felt unusually tired for midafternoon, woke up face down with a bloody nose and head, was very dizzy and couldn&#39;t walk was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and patient&#39;s skull fracture that had occurred before the vaccine the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-057947:Second Dose Case

                                                I passed out and suffered a concussion. My wife found me on the floor when she heard me hit the ground. I was taken to the hospital and stayed for two nights while given numerous scans and tests. No indication of stroke or poor heart condition revealed by any of the tests. No other symptoms other than soreness (which could have been attributed to the fall).

                                                Approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine shot, I experienced sudden dizziness and nausea for approximately 1 minute. Also, my entire left arm looked a bit red, but no hives. It went away as quickly as it occurred. Approximately 30 minutes after that, I experienced nausea again( which was a bit more intense). It also lasted for approximately 1 minute then it quickly ceased. At 4pm (5 hours after the shot), I got a severe headache. I&#39;m not sure if that was related to the vaccine. I took acetaminophen and slept soundly through the night. The next day, I felt fine, and I have felt fine since.

                                                About a day later I noticed some itching in the back of neck and over the course of a few more days, it got worse and I started to see red welts developing on my neck, left shoulder, and left upper side of chest and back.  It was very itchy and starting to get more painful.  Then 10 days later some of the welts turned to scabs while new welts were developing.  Much more pain.  Also, I left shoulder started to increase with pain and was loosing range of motion.    About 5 days into the first shot, I spoke to my primary doctor and originally he said just a reaction to vaccine, use Alegra and that should  take care of it.  I contacted him 10 days into the vaccine and sent him pictures of the welts and he said it&#39;s very clear I have the shingles.  While he didn&#39;t say the shingles were related to the vaccine, the timing is very suspicious.  I truly believe something happened with the vaccine that caused this.

                                                $ hours following the vaccination, I felt very faint and dizzy and nearly passed out. I checked my blood pressure, which was normal. My pulse rate was low (58). I remained dizzy and weak for the rest of the day, with some nausea, but no vomitting. My dizzyness and weakness gradually dissipated over the next 3 days.

I told the  RN was having a reaction. I had brought my liquid benadryl in case I might have a reaction due to my severe food allergies. I immediately drank 50 mg of benadryl.  In 2 to 3 minutes my heart rate came down and I felt better. I was able to leave and drive home. I am an RN myself so I knew how to manage this situation.

On 15 Jan, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I began to get back and leg aches from my sciatica, but on my left side.  I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

                                                Patient came to the emergency department on 02/02/2020 at 2:30 pm to be evaluated for possible stroke due to sudden acute numbness, weakness in right wrist and arm, but no pain. Patient has no prior history of sudden acute numbness in arm and did not report any recent injury to his arm. Neurologist evaluated patient for possible stroke and patient was unable to lift right wrist and hand. Patient was able to lift both arms overhead, lift both legs, smile normal, open and close mouth and move tongue.  Both CT Scan and MRI were normal. Neurologist and emergency medical specialist determined that patient did not have a stroke and diagnosed acute brachial plexus palsy possibly due to patient sleeping in an awkward position. Emergency specialist said it was unlikely but could not rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine, which patient had received 10 days earlier (second dose, see details above.)

Son took me to ER - Medical Center - and they put me on an IV and gave me Meclizine. Kept me for obsevation for 36 hours as it was not subsiding (the vertigo). Ruled out stroke with CT scan. They sent me home with Meclizine and I&#39;m still taking it. I get Vertigo every day still.

Patient was subsequently moved to a room and further evaluated including vital signs and 12 lead EKG. It was determined that patient is currently undergoing workup for possible cardiac issue, was recently started on Nitroglycerin yesterday and has a tentative angiogram scheduled Monday 3/1/21. After lying down during the evaluation patient&#39;s dizziness began to worsen. Talked with patient and spouse and recommended transport to the hospital for further evaluation.

I asked patient what happened and he stated that suddenly he felt dizzy and that he was anxious about the vaccine from the beginning and excited to get it at the same time, then I measured the blood pressure  it was 125/61 with pulse of 45/min.I offered him and his wife to call 911 but they declined it. I asked him to go back to my consultation area so he could lie down on the floor and raise his legs up so we can bring back the blood pressure up, he did that, and he went with me over there and laid down on the floor and we raised his legs up,later I measured his blood pressure again, and it was 113/71 with pulse 51/minute, I offered again to call 911 but he refused and he said that he was feeling better. I left him about 10 more minutes,then he started to get up and sit by the chair and I re-measured the blood pressure  and it was 121/76 with pulse of 54/minute, he started to drink water. He stated he felt better than he was about 20 minutes ago, then they left once their driver came to pick them up.

The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation and had a pacemaker placed about 8-9 months ago.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event were blood pressure medication, antiarrhythmics.  On 01 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030m20a) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01 Mar 2021, after vaccination, the patient developed red dots on both of his arms. For next two days, the patient had rash on both arms, was dizzy, felt sick, developed fast heart rate; went to hospital twice for heart rate either 07 Mar 2021 or 13 Mar 2021.During first visit to hospital, fast rate was brought under control, while in the second visit, the patient had a procedure in which his heart was cut from top to bottom and was made pacemaker dependent. The atrial fibrillation could not be controlled for 26 hours and had a flutter which was not identified and could not be controlled. Flutter returned after stopping amlodipine and hence patient was restarted on amlodipine. The patient now feels very weak, has a hard time walking, has no energy, cannot do the simplest of tasks, still experiences fast heart rate and flutter every now and then.   No Laboratory investigations were provided. The Treatment information included pacemaker, amlodipine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cardiac pacemaker dependent, atrial fibrillation, red dots on both of his arms, rash on both arms, dizziness, sick, atrial flutter, very weak and no energy, hard time walking, cannot do the simplest of tasks were unknown.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

I sat on the edge of the tub. After a couple of minutes I went to get up and fainted on the floor.  My BP was 89/49 with a pulse of 86bpm. I was helped off the floor and back to bed where I lay with my feet elevated by a couple of pillows. No further issues at this time.

                                                At 12:15 a.m. on March 09 chills and fever suddenly started. I was shivering so bad that I was having muscle spasms so bad that I had difficulty walking on my right leg (hip replacement January 2020). After taking tylenol for fever my temp had gone down to 100. Headaches started soon after the fever and muscle spasms and it lasted well into the afternoon on the 9th along with feeling cold and clammy. At about 7:00 p.m. on the 9th, the fever started going back up so I took another dose of tylenol. The fever lasted until about 4:00 a.m. on the tenth. Currently, 10:00 a.m. on the tenth I feel somewhat normal, just really tired and having muscle pain in my upper back. All things considered, the whole ordeal felt like my time when I was getting better after going through covid in December.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

                                                Two days after his covid vaccine injection, he began to feel soreness in his left calf. He thought he was just experiencing a side effect from the vaccine. The soreness got worse and worse until about 2 weeks later when he had significant swelling and pain and could not not walk on the leg. He went to the hospital ED on 3/18 for care. He was admitted to  Hospital on that date for tests and blood thinners. He was discharged on 3/20 but was instructed to return by his PCP for continuing treatment with blood thinners (Eloquis) until she could see him  on Monday - they agreed to keep him in the ED and he was discharged home on Monday to see his PCP.

                                                My skin turned red immediately after the injection.  The EMT Staff examined me and my pulse, temperature and blood pressure were normal.  After 45 minutes the redness abated and I came home,    1 March 2021 I came down with COVID symptoms with dizziness, blurry vision, redness, ringing in the ear and flu like symptoms of body aches.   Then the neuralgia in the dextral ulnar nerve increased and clawing started.  Then same happened on the sinistral ulnar nerve and Carpal tunnel in the other finders.  I feared going to sleep for fear of awaking with paralysis.  I drank vodka to calm myself down and Xanax to sleep (I know it is a dangerous combination).  2 March the red skin continues and when I awoke at 13:30 today I was still extreme and I called 911.  The EMS visited and determined my blood pressure and pulse were normal.  The dextral  ulnar nerve problems continue,

                                                I began to experience lightheadedness, generalized weakness and confusion. My handwriting changed. These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.

Injection site pain peaked within a day, and was lessened by day two. However, he woke late morning fearing he had a stroke. His symptoms were primarily related to range of motion in vaccinated arm. He had difficult dressing. Exam findings consistent with adhesive capsulitis and course of physical therapy recommended.

I was in my girlfriend&#39;s home and was barely able to get to the toilet in time. The diarrhea appeared pea soup green in color and consistency and very smelly.  Of interest, my girlfriend who also received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on the same date, time and location, was awaken at approximately 2:00 AM with the same rapid onset of diarrhea.  On the second day following the vaccine, we both had elevated temperatures of 101.5 and 102 lasting approximately 24 hours.

                                                The day of the shot, we noticed significant swelling in my neck on the right of center.  The swelling has maintained its size for now six weeks and one day.  I have a dull numbness in my 2-3 smaller toes of my left foot.  Sometimes I feel this numbness in my right foot, but not always.  My left arm and two smallest fingers also feel funny.  There is a dull pain in my left arm and dull numbness in my left smaller fingers.  The outside of my left leg also at times shares this numb feeling.  On the day I got the shot I immediately felt like I had a dose of caffeine, though that feeling passed after a couple of hours.  It did not feel significant enough to keep me from driving or leaving the facility, but it was noticeable. I experienced diarrhea for about a week and a half. For the first week after the shot I alternated nights of not being able to stay still sleeping, keeping me awake almost the entire night, 3 of the first 6 nights.  I visited my family doctor within one week of the first shot.  He advised me not to get the second shot and made note of the swelling in my neck. I visited him at five weeks because the swelling in my neck and numb feeling has not changed.  He scheduled a CT Scan which has been scheduled.
