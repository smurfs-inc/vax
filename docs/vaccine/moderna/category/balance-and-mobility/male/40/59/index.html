                                                I received the vaccine 30 min. prior to starting my shift as a Nurse in the ED. About 1 hour after receiving the shot while standing I felt off balance and began to have a vertigo like dizziness. I sat down and tried to drink some water but began spitting the water back up and dry heaving after trying to drink. I did not feel nauseous if I was not drinking. I did feel the sensation of a slight lump in my throat. I did not have any shortness of breath, tachycardia,  rash or fever. I did not want to check in as a patient so I called my wife to come and pick me up from work. Before I left I had the pharmacy send me some Pepcid and Benadryl and I took 25mg of Benadryl and 20mg of Pepcid before leaving. I left work around 1400 and now at 1500 I am able to drink fluids. The slight lump in my throat seems to have improved. I still feel a little dizzy and off balance.

                                                After about 15 minutes, I began to feel lightheaded and experience a tingling in my arms/hands. I&#39;d guess it was related to the nerves in the arms, because it specifically affected my pinky and ring fingers on both hands. I was also unsteady on my feet, but did not lose consciousness. The lightheadedness and tingling continued off and on for most of the day. The tingling appeared to go away the next day, but I still experienced periodic (though rare) feelings of lightheadedness. Perhaps 2-3 time the next day (Saturday) and experienced maybe 1-2 times the following day (Sunday). I did not take Adderall on the weekend. On Monday, I did take Adderall and returned to work, where I experience some tingling again and longer bouts of lightheadedness. Again, I have not lost consciousness.

Slept all day. Went to bed in the evening and woke again at 3am shivering uncontrollably. Hands have continued to stay cold. No appetite as well.

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

                                                Severe dizziness started around 10:00pm then got a little better around 6 am the next day. Hardly got any sleep that night. Then around 8am I started to have chills which then I checked my temp and it was 101.0 degrees F. Then I started to get a headache and severe body aches. Around 3pm I tried to eat something which I then threw it up. I tried to drink water and flavored water which I also threw up the water. I also went into the bathtub 7 times that day to stop the chills. Which it did but right when I got out they started again which then I felt worse. Around 11pm 1/23/2021 I ended up going into the ER which then they gave me IV fluids and then Benadryl and Toradol by IV. After those were administered I started feeling better which then I was discharged and went home.

                                                Received the following symptoms starting 15 hours after the vaccine.  Full body fatigue. Could not stand up for two hours from my bed. This was followed by body aches pains and chills. It also included heightened skin sensitivity. Physical touch and contact on anywhere but my palms in the pads of my feet was extremely painful. The best example I can give is, taking a shower was like getting shot at by multiple BB gun pellets.   At 1450 PST, I experience shortness of breath and wheezing. Struggled to walk up 12 steps.  Continued with migraine. Weakness in body. Pain and body. Skin sensitive until about 36 hours after the vaccine. Did not try walking up and down stairs again, but breathing was slightly challenged Until about 30 hour mark.  Struggled with migraines from The 24 hour mark until the 48 hour mark.It was the weekend. I did not go in. I just graded it out. Fatigue lasted all the way until the 48 hour mark.  Funny enough? I did not developed a sore arm symptom.

                                                On 28-FEB-2021, at approximately 2000, I developed left facial numbness felt on top of the left forehead, left eyebrow, left nasal bridge, inside of left nose (nares), top and bottom of left lip, left side of the cheek, and left side of the tongue.  Left eye blin is weak and unable to fully close left eye.  Left ear was aggravated and irritated when scratched.  Hearing is distorted, felt as if I had been submerged in water for a prolonged amount of time.  There is ringing at times on left ear as well.  Symptoms were progressive.  Today (05-MAR-2021), also developed vertiginous sensation and light-headedness.

                                                It has been 6 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. For the first 3-4 days I had the usual moderate flu-like symptoms:  dizziness, headaches, fatigue, chills, soreness at vaccine siteetc.  Days 5-7 I seemed to gradually improve. On day 8 all of the symptoms returned with greater severity: this time I had a fever, the chills were much more intense, the headaches were excruciating, body and joint aches all over the place--I couldn&#39;t sleep or focus on anything cognitively taxing.  Interestingly, my brother, who was vaccinated just after me, also had more severe side effects beginning on day 8 post 2nd dose. He improved after 3-4 days, but my recovery has been much much lengthier. By day 14 I was still feeling very ill, though the fever did subside.  Sometime in the third week the pain in my arm at the vaccination site returned, then became intermittent, and still bothers me from time to time. I also started getting muscle spasms in the same exact locations that sent me to the ER after my probably bout with Covid in the spring of 2020. Thankfully these lasted only a week or so, though I began feeling muscle soreness in different parts of my body, ever changing. By the 4th week I was slightly better and down to 4 main symptoms: chills (by far the worst of the symptoms--to the point at which my skin would feel like it was being frostbitten by dry ice every time I changed sweaty clothes), occasional splitting headaches, and muscle soreness that included both the injection site on my arm and other areas.  I had other symptoms as well, fatigue and brain fog, etc, but these were present before the vaccination, though not as severe.

                                                &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34;  Several hours after receiving first dose of vaccine my left arm became very painful to the point of bringing me to tears whenever I tried to move it or use it: lifting something as simple as a glass of water was excruciating pain. Second day is a little better with a little more mobility, but trying to undress and undress is torture, especially lifting my arm over my head or past my chest.

                                                A little less than 3 hours after getting the shot, I noticed the injection site was getting very sore. Within about a half hour of first noticing it, that entire muscle was aching a lot. It?s now 4:50pm and it hurts to lift my arm, reach for anything, I can even feel it just by typing this out. I?ve also noticed I?m pretty tired, my joints feel very achey like when I have a cold, and I?m incredibly thirsty. The pain in the muscle at injection site is by far the worst symptom though. It?s extremely painful. I did not expect that since it didn?t hurt when getting the actual shot. Took my temp and it?s normal. The aching joints are far less painful than my arm, but are an issue nonetheless. Had I known this would happen beforehand, I would still get the shot, so as long as it doesn?t get a lot worse or something else haplens, all in all I?d have to say it was worth it.

He told the pharmacist he was starting to feel funny and immediately fell on his back. I ran out to around the counter and he was conscious and sweaty. He was responsive, knew his name and where he was. He described feeling very hot. He did not have any rash or swelling visible.

                                                Patient recieved the vaccine  in the left arm and was asked to wait in the pharamcy waiting area for observation for 15 minutes (no previous hx of anaphylaxis). Upon returning to the main pharmacy floor a few minutes later one of the technicians alerted me to the patient had retrurned to the counter and was &#34;feeling something&#34;. He was visibly struggling to maintain balance and I asked patient to take a seat to prevent any risk of falls and motioned to a chair. He took a seat on the floor  next to the pharmacy counter and I rushed over to him to tend to him. I asked him if was having any other symptoms and he noted he was feeling lightheaded and having chills all over his body. His body was cold and clammy to the touch and had a difficult time locatiing a pulse on the radial artery. While talking to him his responses were shorter and he seemed like was starting to almost lose conciousness. Management had already called 911 and we offered water to the patient while we waited. Prior to the paramedics arriving I was able to get a pulse using a cuff and it was around 53bpm, the patient also seemed hypotensive.

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (hospitalized for 7 days; treated with Remdesivir; long recovery) from 11-Sep-2020 to October 2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure (ongoing issues) and Heart rate (ongoing issues).    On 05-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues). At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke), ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 9.64 after one round of the vaccine. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 220 natural antibodies after 2 months.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient reports that he had worked for an urgent care performing testing and contracted COVID-19 back in 11SEP2020. Patient was hospitalized for 7 days, was administered Remdesivir, and had a long recovery. Patient reports having issues regulating his blood pressure and heart rate so bad that he had almost died during that time. The recovery took up until 1st week of October and did not feel well until then. Patient reports it was advised to defer first dose of vaccination for COVID-19 for 3 months.   Patient self-medicated with OTC Tylenol and Advil which did not help. Patient reports that he was hospitalized a second time around last month (03MAR2021 approximately) for experiencing a stroke. Symptoms felt like he was experiencing a mini-COVID-19 episode and was having a relapse of COVID-19. ER professional advised patient to never take the second dose of the vaccine. Patient reports taking an antibody test (after a single dose of the vaccine) for both natural and for the spike protein on 25MAR2021. Patient reports that he had gotten a 9.64 reading from just one round of the vaccine in comparison to the doctors he had worked who had received both doses of the vaccine, never gotten sick with COVID-19, and produced a 9.0 reading. Patient reports his natural antibodies after 2 months was at 220. Patient wishes to report this information to highlight that his natural antibodies were so high from the previous COVID-19 infection that when he had gotten the first round of the vaccine, he believes that his body rejected the vaccine so strongly that he presented with severe side effects from the vaccine. Patient would like to submit his information to show that he is proof that if someone previously had COVID-19, they should only need a single dose of the vaccine. In addition, patient expressed that if a patient&#39;s natural antibody is high, then a reduced dose should be provided or the vaccine should be deferred until natural antibodies reduce   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 02-Apr-2021: Event details reported; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                about 4 days after receiving the vaccine developed severe vertigo. Primarily triggered when transferring from horizontal to vertical position or vice versa. spinning sensation subsides within a minute of remaining stationary, but the lingering nausea caused by it can last for hours afterwards. It became slightly better by the second day of symptoms but is still quite severe compared to any past episodes in my life.

After an additional hour of rest and following a few anti-vertigo maneuver attempts, I was able to rise. More than three weeks later, I still experience moderate dizziness when waking and often if tilting my head back more than 45 degrees in the normal course of the day. No medical treatment has bee prescribed.

I administered the vaccine and asked him to remain in the store for a 15-minute observation period (just like the 1st dose). After 2-3 minutes he walked to the pharmacy window to let my technician know he was starting to feel dizzy. At the same time my technician was informing me about his complaint, he lost consciousness and fell, hitting the side of his head on the consultation wall. I immediately asked technician to call 911 and rushed to get EpiPen to patient. He immediately regained consciousness. I did not administer any EpiPen doses. I stayed with him and monitored him until paramedics arrived. When paramedics arrived, they asked me which vaccine I administered and started asking patient questions. They measured his blood pressure. Patient was responsive and he called his wife to let her know he was going to the ER. Paramedic informed us that his blood pressure was low. On his way to the hospital he looked at us and said thank you. I will call him tomorrow to check on him.

It got better after some stretching Ice and anti inflammatory I also noticed I could not press any weight over my head and my right scapula was winging then the pain came back about four days later. The pain was so bad I went to urgent care and was given muscle relaxers.  The pain went away after a couple days but after giving it several weeks to see if the winging and weakness in my arm went away.  When it didn&#39;t I contacted Orthopedics to have my arm looked at.  The PA and was seen by noticed the scapular winging and believes its due to damage of my long thoracic nerve.

I have to lay down or sit all the time. When I stand, my left leg pain increases to extremely high level and starts feeling numbness on the feet.

                                                I had what I thought was &#34;normal&#34; pain at the injection site (left shoulder) initially however the pain spread from the injection site downward to my mid triceps by Saturday to Sunday afternoon. By Sunday night my shoulder mobility began to diminish (lifting the arm enough to comfortably shower was challenging). By Monday my shoulder and elbow radiated with pain originating at the injection site. By Monday afternoon I had lost virtually all mobility and strength in shoulder such that I could not raise my arm high enough to wash my left arm/hand enough to wash my hands in a kitchen sink/bathroom (which has NEVER been an issue). Since Monday, any activity that innervates the left shoulder to generate movement results in debilitating pain. By Tuesday the pain, immobility, and strengthless-ness had spread gradually to my left pectoral muscle, my left rear deltoids, my left elbow, my left forearm and slightly into my left pinky and ring fingers. Wednesday (today) all the symptoms from Tuesday are still present with the added symptom that maintaining proper posture through my left shoulder is also painful so now I&#39;m hunching on my left side.

                                                Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA).  The Nurse Practitioner administered the shot too high on my arm, up near the shoulder.  As a result, the shot was injected in or near the bursa, causing extreme pain, limited range of motion, and potentially long term damage.  I was diagnosed with Bursitis in the hospital two days later following a CT scan.  It does not appear the standard &#34;two finger width&#34; approach was followed to ensure injection into the deltoid muscle.  I am still in chronic pain.  I&#39;ve received tramadol, percocet, and a corticosteroid injection.  I have a consultation with an orthopedic surgeon next week.  My shoulder was fine prior to the administration of the second vaccine, which seems to be due to poor technique by the nurse practitioner who administered it.

                                                The day after I received the second shot, I woke up with dizzy spells, vertigo, a fever and chills. I could barley walk and I also threw up. I am not throwing up anymore but I am still feeling dizzy and I am having trouble functioning and walking everyday. The vertigo came and went for about four weeks. I am still experiencing these side effects. Please help.

                                                I work at a Hospital sterilizing surgical equipment.  After I received the vaccine, the hospital staff observed me for 15 minutes to see if a reaction occurred.  I felt fine, and they told me I could go.  I was working that day (2-10:30pm) and had gotten vaccinated at the beginning of my shift.  The rest of my shift went fine.  Near the end, though, my arm began to feel sore.  Driving home, I began to feel tired.  By the time I got home, it felt like a cold was setting in.  I ate a large bowl of chicken soup to try to feel better.  I stayed up a little bit, but was feeling woozy by this point and went to bed.  Bad chills set in and I began to shake I felt so cold.  I used a heating pad to help with this.  I tried to sleep, but my head was throbbing.  The next morning, I tried to sit up in bed but my first attempt proved too difficult.  I took it slower.  I was able to sit up eventually.  Standing was also difficult.  I spent the day mostly lounging on the couch.  I slept a little better that night, but my head was still throbbing somewhat.  No chills this time.  Getting up the next morning went a little better.  I was able to sit up in bed without issue and walking around did not prove as much of a chore.

After observation for 4 hours I was feeling better, and was discharged home.   Ordered to take 40mg of steroids for 2 more days.  After one day post vaccination, I have significant pain at the site and body ache.

Patient was transferred into wheelchair and brought into an examination room with provider NP. Provider and staff collected vitals, blood sugars, and HPI. Patient reported he &#34;felt like he was going to pass out&#34; but did not actually syncopize. Patient was with staff for well over one hour for observation, and symptoms resolved within 15 minutes of the initial onset without intervention. It was deemed likely vasovagal response by the provider.

Then that night, I woke up at 3:30 am 1/16 with severe chills, full-body aches, and high fever (although I was unable to walk to get the thermometer). During the day 1/16, as I write this, I continue to feel similar symptoms to when I was Covid positive in March 2020. Tylenol and Motrin help the symptoms to subside.

                                                Around 11:30 pm that evening I started feeling extremely warm in my face and thighs. Figuring it was due to the shot, I decide to try and lay down to sleep it off. A short time later, I awoke freezing with chills and uncontrollable shivering. My whole body hurt especially my lower back and pressure in my head. This continued throughout the night until the early morning. As the shivering and chills subsided, extreme fatigue, body aches and head pressure continued and it was difficult to get up at points. I had no appetite and forced myself to drink to stay hydrated.  About 1:00 pm, I started to feel better, but that was short lived. Approximately 4:30 ? 5pm, the chills and shivering returned and I had 101 fever. I had some tea and toast and then went to bed for the night. When I awoke this morning, I felt a million times better. As of writing this email, I still have some slight fatigue, aches, and head pressure, but night and day difference from yesterday.

That pain remained for approximately 24 to 48 hours that lead to extreme pain and stiff neck on my right side. Chills and periodic fever developed for two days past shot. By day three I had extreme right side neck pain that continued down into my right shoulder blade. By day four and five I suffered from extreme neck pain and severe headache that was focused from my right eye through my head down the right side of my neck to my right shoulder blade. By day 4 this continued with dizziness and blurred vision. I had inability to eat and strong feelings to vomit but only didn&#39;t because I hadn&#39;t consumed any food that day. I continued to suffer from extreme headaches and complete physical exhaustion with inability to stay away. In addition, I continued to have periodic chills but with no fever.  As I submit this in day 5 I still suffer from lack of energy and the stiff neck remains down through my right shoulder blade.

                                                Delayed reaction occurred 8 hrs. after receiving vaccine. Felt as if I was injected with the Flu, based on the symptoms that arose: chills, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, fever, body aches, weakness, no appetite or desire to hydrate(every single symptom was severe) These symptoms lasted 12 hrs. I chose to go in to work, instead of taking the day off. I truly believe that because I pushed my body through this painful ordeal, it helped me to overcome this Flu-like feeling that I endured for 12 hours: 10 of those at my job. I also experienced a swelling &amp; pain in my right knee. The pain &amp; swelling is finally subsiding as I type this report 4 days after the vaccine.

On Saturday my arm was still sore so took some more Ibuprofen. Sunday I was feeling fine until about 8 pm when I started to get a little dizzy.  On Monday when I woke up I could barely raise my head. Everything was spinning. I was very dizzy and my mouth was dry. I had no concept of time. 2 mins would feel like 2 hours and 2 hour could feel like 2 mins. I started to feel a little better around 4 pm. Today I still feel a little hazy in the head.

I believed I was dying.  Medic indicated I turned &#34;white&#34;.  The symptoms peaked within 1-2 minutes after onset and stayed bad for several minutes.  After a few  minutes  My pulse started to increase and  all symptoms started improving.  Within 10 minutes I was feeling well enough to sit, and within 30 minutes I was able to drive home.

                                                About 8 minutes after receiving vaccine, patient asked for water and reported that he did not feel well. He reported feeling faint and slight shortness of breath. The pharmacy staff gave him water and advised him that he could remove his mask to assist with breathing and began to observe him closely. The patient began to fee l better almost immediately, and was asked to remain in the observation area a little longer in case of worsening symptoms. During the next several minutes the patient experienced two more brief spells of faintness, which were relieved with more water and deep breathing. The patient reported that he had been working out in the sun earlier in the morning and that he was possibly a little dehydrated when he came in for his vaccine. He said that the symptoms he was experiencing were similar to episodes of dehydration he had experienced in the past. After about 40 minutes of total observation the patient said that he was feeling fine and that he felt fine to leave and drive home on his own. He walked around the store for a few minutes to make sure he would not feel faint while walking, and then left the building. I called and left a message for the patient tonight, and will attempt to call again tomorrow morning.

Aftervaccination i sat with pt a few minutes to make sure he was feeling well and ready to move to a chair in front of the pharmacy to sit for 30 minutes and make sure he is feeling well. I notified my manager that pt in front has fainted before and he kept a close eye on him. I was administering shot to the next pt and heard a sound. I left vaccination booth and saw pt on the ground. I placed his legs/feet in front of him and his wife held his head and ice pack. Our pt reported that he did not hit or hurt his head and did not need other assistance. we monitored the patient an additional 20 minutes and he was feeling well, vital signs good and accompanied by his wife.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

BP first reading in left arm was 235/130 with a HR around 130. Second reading was 205/120 with HR in 120&#39;s about 4 min later.  I requested an ambulance due to the feeling of being very unwell and dizzy.  Trouble concentrating.    Ambulance ride was 190/112 ish EKG and BP monitoring at hospital.   No anaphalaxis diagnosed but unknown cause.   ER discharge after benadryl.    BP and HR would continue to cycle up and down for the next  18 hours.   Red spot formed about 2 inches away from where I was injected.      PCP and allergist thin it was an intravascular injection.

                                                3 minutes after vaccination the patient began to feel a tingling and pain in his arm where the vaccine was placed.  Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

Shivering was like I was having a seizure for about 3 hours.  Severe nausea to the point where I can hardly eat.  I&#39;m down almost 5 pounds since Wed morning.  Severe headache since Wed night that feels like I have an ice pick in my forehead.  Excessive fatigue, sleeping about 16 hours Thur and today (Friday).  Severe dizziness when standing from a chair or bed; need to brace on wall for about five minutes before episode passes.  Loss of taste and smell.  Severe neck pain.  Photo sensitivity.  Runny nose and sever sinus pressure.  Maintaining a temperature of about 100 and 101.  Had to take off work Thur and half day off today, teleworking the other half.

                                                I received my first Covid-19 Moderna injection and felt slightly groggy and tired as the day progressed. Just before bed I noticed my arm was quite sore and I still felt tired and slightly light headed. The next day (Feb 4) I had a very sore left arm at the injection site but felt good otherwise. I came home from work and took one 200mg Ibuprofen as my arm was still quite sore. The following day (Feb 5) my arm pain subsided but I still felt light headed during the evening. I am writing this on Feb. 18th and each day I have bouts of being light headed and have difficulty concentrating. There is no real pattern to what time of day I get the symptoms. I do not have the classic headache but definitely feel pressure in my head and behind my eyes. I also find that I wake up after a full nights sleep and feel not well rested. I spoke with my doctor last week and he suggested I give it until this week to see where things are at. I plan on contacting him soon to schedule an appointment to discuss my symptoms more. Before getting the vaccine I did not have any of these symptoms as I describe.

I know exactly what happened because I&#39;ve had my other shoulder broken no less than three times. I know exactly what a shoulder socket full of fluid feels like. There is no discerible swelling it redness, and absolutely none of the bruise-like pain normally associated with any if the dozens of vaccinations a person gets throughout their lifetime. The pain is inside my shoulder and comes from trying to use my arm. It feels like my arm is going to come out if the socket if I so much as move my arm away from my body. If this person is doing this to other people then he needs to be stopped ASAP. No names were given. He is a shorter male, medium build, darker skin, (far as I could tell from the PPE), and spoke with a slight accent.

                                                After giving the shot pt was advised to wait 15 mins so our pharmacy team can monitor him to make sure there is no allergic reactions to the vaccine. Patient was fine and was able to walk into the waiting area by himself after receiving the shot. About 2 mins later, patient&#39;s wife asked for the pharmacist&#39;s attention to check on the patient. Patient stated that he felt light headed and was about to pass out, and pharmacist on duty immediately called 911.  Paramedic checked on the patient, and patient was able to walk out the store on his own after 15 mins.

                                                I was driving on the highway and experienced numbness starting in my lips.  This numbness then moved throughout my body into my limbs.  I had some mobility and was able to pull off of the highway down an exit but at one point, I could not lift my legs or control my hands.  I called 911 but it was very difficult to do so with the numbness.  I then started to regain my mobility but had some continued numbness around the left side of my mouth.  The paramedics tested my vitals and everything came back as normal.    They recommended that I have someone come pick me up. So I had a neighbor come pick me up and someone drive my car home.  I did not lose any vision or mental capacity throughout this.  It was just a wave of numbness throughout my entire body.  It lasted 5-10 minutes but felt like an eternity. I am lucky to be alive and to not have crashed my vehicle into someone or something.

Could not focus or concentrate at all.  Had to call for someone to drive me home as I did not want to drive. Now ( 24 hours later ) I still feel the same. Slight headache but more concerned with lack of being able to  concentrate.  Knowingly making little mistakes  when  trying to function.  Not confused but can not think clear or focus on what I&#39;m doing

I contributed it to just being sore like the literature had sad. When I received my second dose within 20 minutes my arm was extremely sore. It got to the point where I could not lift my arm at all and had no ROM in it at all. It was like my arm just was not working and I would have to move my arm around with my right arm. I was taking 600-800 mg of Motrin every 6 hours and alternating Tylenol 1000 mg and it was not easing the pain. It got to the point where the pain was so unbearable that I went to the Emergency Room on 4/3 where I was diagnosed with Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA). The gave me some Toradol and Decadron IM and sent me home with Naproxen and Prednisone with orders to follow up with my PCP

Day 2 better but still times heart would race.

                                                On 01-14-2021 at about 8:00pm, I began to experience nerve inflammation. I had pain in my right arm, it was a fiery electrical pain that radiated from my right shoulder down to my right hand. The joints in my hands particularly my right index finger, ring finger and thumb felt incredibly painful. I could not pick up or grasp anything. It felt like I had intense rheumatoid arthritis and my symptoms lasted about 5-6 days before they started to go away.

It was so much that neither I could sleep nor my wife because she felt that there is a heat on next to her. Also, I had a very bad headache and chili. I sweat all the night so much that all my clothes, pillow, blanket, etc got wet. I was feeling so awful that my wife wanted to call 911. On 4/14, in the afternoon, again my situation got worse.I was not able  to stand even for a short time, because I got dizzy immediately and my headache got worse Since I do not have insurance, I did not know what I should do. Which medication I should take, Where I should go. The only place that came to my mind was the center where I got the vaccine at. figuring out that it is closed by checking the work hour. I contacted the emergency room, and finally the next day on 4/15, I had to go to the urgent care, which I was charged around $400 for 2 IV&#39;s and a blood test, but I still had fever and headache

                                                Day after the vaccine I awoke with a very sore left arm which was to be expected.  Upon moving I experienced vertigo, dizziness, headache, and extreme pressure in the left side of my face to include sinus cavities and deep inner ear pressure.  I had some episodes of loose stools, not diarrhea, but not formed stools.  These symptoms still persist to today, 1/15/2021, except for loose stool, that has returned to normal.  I had a Dr. appointment today and the doctor would not rule out post vaccine side effects. I was tested for COVID on 1/11/2021 as a precautionary measure as I was displaying symptoms, but the test result was COVID not detected.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

                                                Within 48 hours of receiving the COVID vaccine, I began having extreme pressure and discomfort in my right ear.  Symptoms included dizziness, fullness in the ear and hearing loss.  This persisted for several days.  As a first course of action, I took Tylenol and antihistamines.   I saw my PCP a few days later and he misdiagnosed my condition and suggested that I continue with antihistamines and Flonase.  Two weeks later my condition had improved only slightly and I became more concerned.  I asked my PCP whether a short course of steroids was warranted (at the suggestion of my mom and wife, who are both health care professionals).  He prescribed a &#34;dose pack,&#34; which I started on or about Monday, Feb. 22.  Later that week, I connected with an ENT  who is a friend of a friend .  When I told him my story and symptoms he was extremely concerned and got me an immediate appointment on Friday, Feb. 26.  At that visit I was diagnosed with acute and severe Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that had resulted in 92% hearing loss in my right ear.   Additional symptoms continue to include fullness, tinnitus and other discomfort.  None of these issues existed prior to my COVID vaccine shot.  I am currently undergoing a treatment of high dose prednisone and steroid injections in my ear.   I am scheduled for another visit with doctor on Friday, March 12.

Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

I woke up the next day to go to my job and as I was standing at my closet to grab a shirt I felt like I was going to pass out. everything went black. The next thing I knew I was laying on the floor with a shirt in my hand but don&#39;t remember how I got on the floor or if I even fell.  I asked my Girlfriend if she had heard me fall, She said no. I walked into the bedroom and layed back down on the bed still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. after what felt like a few minutes, I began Heaving like I was going to throw up but I felt like it was a dream and was very slow to react until my girlfriend told me to run to the bathroom. the whole time I was coughing up a foam.

On 01-23-2021 in the next morning I woke up with heart racing with chest pressure, felt dizzy with SOB. I called an ambulance and they performed an EKG which was normal. I went to the hospital and they did triponine values, EKG and I was released after 24 hours of monitoring. About five days later I went to see my PCP for a physical I had scheduled. He performed another EKG and this time it looked abnormal, showed I had gone into cardiac arrest and other tests, such as stress test, reactive blockages test and heart test were also performed.  I had no blockage nor heart attack. I then drove home and since then I have been going to doctor&#39;s appointments. I have also scheduled a second dose of Moderna vaccine in three to four weeks.

                                                Two nights in a row, 04/07 and 04/08, woke up with rapid heart rate (fluctuating from 85-110 bpm) and felt dizzy, fatigued, feverish, sweaty, shaky and about to pass out. Could have been hyperventilating in sleep because of rapid heart rate. Required about 2 hours of attention to reading, yoga and relaxation to get to sleep. On morning of 04/08, heart rate was still high (78-95) for resting, which is usually in the 50s or 60s. GI disturbance led to frequent bowel movements and the whole condition resulted in malaise and feeling of impending doom. A feedback from acute anxiety as a result of symptoms could be involved. Also involved is the diphenhydramine I took at 9 pm on 04/07 to treat hay fever and acute insomnia. Night if 04/08 was more manageable. But it interrupted sleep with strong disturbances that felt like spasms in prefrontal cortex coming out of sleep. More likely it was movement in sinus congestion that triggered a startle response while exhausted from work. It was bad timing to have the shot during a very busy work week.

                                                I was feeling fine directly after getting the injection. All of a sudden, after about 5 minutes, I felt a rush go through my body and managed to declare &#34;I&#39;m not feeling well&#34; before I lost coherence and clarity. My wife called for help from the attendants as I started to convulse, get dizzy, start sweating, and feel like I was going to pass out. I then proceeded to throw up a couple of times and had to lie back for 30 minutes before switching to the passenger side of the vehicle for the ride home. I was completely worn out and weak, with flu-like symptoms and nausea for the rest of the day and for several days afterward.

                                                Today afternoon/evening I started to get sore and have a headache (which is normal from what I hear.) I could only sleep a couple hours Tuesday night into Wednesday morning because I kept tossing and turning. When I woke up Wednesday morning (4-21-21) around 6:00 am, I couldn&#39;t move as I normally could and when I tried to walk I found it very painful. The whole area between my knees and my shoulders were completely numb yet it felt as if it were on fire. I slept most of the morning and a little in the afternoon as it was very painful to move, talk, laugh, etc... Finally in the late afternoon (3:00-4:00ish) the numbness wore off but the burning sensation persisted. I felt progressively better throughout Thursday (4-22-21) and about the same time in the afternoon (3:00-4:00ish) the burning wore off as well. That evening I felt perfectly normal except for the typical achiness that tends to occur with  vaccines. Today (Friday 4-23-21) I feel rested and back to my normal self.

One day it will be better, the next worse, then even worse, then recovery, then almost gone, back to spins and dizziness.  I read somewhere it may be cykotines affecting my inner ear.  I also have a mildly stuffed nose but nothing out of the ordinary.  This stuffiness is allergies (seasonal?) related perhaps.  Today (4/29) it went back to &#34;worse&#34;

                                                Patient by 5/8/21 was experiencing fever to 103, lower back pain, palpitaitons, headache, nausea, left arm and neck pain and dizziness.  He was taking Advil and Tylenol to assist with symptom managment.  Left arm and neck pain persisted.  On the morning of 5/11/21 he awoke with central chest tightness, left arm/shoulder/neck achiness, nausea and headache. During ride to hospital, he had palpitations for 30 minutes.  He arrived at  Medical Center where he was found to have a positive troponin I of 4.2 (ULN of &lt;0.045).  Echo done at that time showed EF of 59% with basal inferior, anterolateral hyokinesia, basal inferolateral hyokinesia, mid inferolateral hyokinesia, diastolic LV function normal function for age and trace mitral regurgitation.  ECG showed non diagnostic ST elevations in leads II, III, AVF.  The patient was transferred to another Medical Center  for urgent cardiac cath based on resting chest, arm and neck pain, positive troponin and wall motion abnormalities seen on echo.  Cardiac cath found normal coronary arteries that were free of disease.  Troponin I at this medical center was positive 0.31 and 0.39.  Further testing ordered is a cardiac MRI to assess for possible acute myocarditis.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Mar-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Syncope) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FALL (Fall), HEAD INJURY (Head injury) and HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Syncope), FALL (Fall), HEAD INJURY (Head injury) and HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 17-Mar-2021, Vital signs measurement: consistent with fainting episode (abnormal) Vital signs consistent with fainting episode and stabilized within fifteen minutes..     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medication use was reported.   Treatment information was not reported.   On 17Mar02021, it was noted by the reporter that the patient was observed kneeling by a chair as diaphoretic immediately post vaccine.

He waited the required 20 minutes to check for any adverse reaction and then left the facility to drive home. On his drive home, at approximately 3:30pm, he started feeling light headed and lost consciousness, striking a telephone pole. He was gasping and struggling to breathe, so the ambulance treated him with oxygen. When he arrived at the ER , the doctor assessed his condition and confirmed that he was experiencing an anaphylactic reaction related to the COVID vaccine and treated him with an epinephrine injection, steroids, benadryl, and nebulized albuterol.to open his airways. He remained at the ER for ~ 6 hours for observation until his blood oxygen levels increased and he was stable to be released. The car accident resulted in PT suffering a fractured sternum as confirmed via Chest CT Scan by his primary doctor. PT has no history of any allergic reaction to any medication or vaccine. Although he does have well-regulated asthma, this incident was not characteristic of any asthma-related reaction he has ever experienced.

After about 3 hours, began to experience dizziness, nausea and fatigue that progressively worsened throughout the day. Went home after work, fell asleep and did not eat dinner due to lack of appetite from nausea and dizziness. Woke up in AM following day (1/7), feeling somewhat better, but still slightly dizzy. Appetite has returned and was able to eat regular meals today.

I began to sweat a little and have minor tachycardia.  I never went back into the clinic but instead leaned the seat of my car back and those symptoms went away after about 30 minutes.  I never experienced any symptoms after that.

                                                After the first day there was the typical site injection pain. Three Tylenol on the next day seem to take care of that but the pain quickly moved to the Front and top of the right pelvic bone. No amount of Tylenol has seem to do anything with that pain. After a week it seem to start to migrate to the left front top pelvic bone. These symptoms were mild and I was still able to carry out my daily activities in law-enforcement.  Friday night January 22 is when I started to have pulsating pressure in the back of my head, chills, dizziness, excessive urination, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. The symptoms have persisted through today but are starting to ease. I took a COVID-19 test on Sunday, January 24 the results came back today as Covid negative.

I had stopped moving to rearrange some items. While stopped, I started to feel lightheaded, develop tunnel vision, and feel faint, almost to the point of blacking out. I put my head down and legs up and felt somewhat better. I then attempted to return to my car. I could go 100-200 yards at a stretch, before having to purposefully fall down and elevate my legs. I traveled the mile back to my car like this (slowly). I could not check my pulse because my hands were too cold; my respiration rate was elevated. At the car, I drank fluids and warmed up and began to recover enough to get home.

He reported he went to his primary care provider later that afternoon.  He was examined clinically and was told that the shot was administered too high up in his arm in the Gleno Humeral Joint.  He was advised to take over the counter pain medication and to call if he needs something stronger.  He was given a follow up appointment on 2/5/2021 with the provider. He was told to monitor for infection in the next 48 hours and they are hoping it did not go into the joint capsule.  Continued to have severe pain.  Went to orthopedic specialist the next day.  Admitted to hospital for pain control and steroids.  MRI of shoulder inconclusive, but think severe bursitis and being treated as such.  Discharged from hospital and resting at home.  Arm range of motion at 80%-hoping to return to work in 2 weeks (firefighter/EMT).

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medication included escitalopram.  On 04 Feb 2021, on the same day as the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 030L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 04 Feb 2021, a couple of hours after the vaccination, the patient couldn&#39;t feel his arm and he had no range in motion.  He also had pain in his upper shoulder area by his neck.  The reporter thought the administration was done incorrectly but she &#34;wasn&#39;t there to conform 100%.&#34;  At night on 04 Feb 2021 and 05 Feb 2021, the patient had aching in his legs &#34;as if he was getting sick.&#34;  Treatment for the events included ibuprofen which helped, and the patient was feeling better at the time of this report.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, couldn&#39;t feel arm and had no range in motion, pain in upper shoulder area by the neck, and aching in legs as if was getting sick, were considered recovering/resolving at the time of this report.  The event, thinks administration was done incorrectly, was considered recovered/resolved on 04 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44-year-old male who experienced NS unexpected events of hypoaesthesia, joint range of motion decreased, arthralgia, neck pain, product administration error, malaise, and NS expected arthralgia.  The events occurred 1 day after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Events resolved.

                                                I experienced what I would describe as a cardiac event. My heart started racing out of no where. I have an activity tracking device and it was pacing me at 184 bbm for thirty minutes then a subsidence to 120 bbm for the next couple hours. By the evening my heart rate had decreased to the 70 - 80 ish range.  Sleep time and the following morning it was what I would consider normal. This event made me dizzy and my skin paled. I was also very tired. It was as if I had done an intense cardio workout with no warm up. 0 to max. I didn&#39;t seek medical attention but did consider it.

The first hit me suddenly while sitting at my desk and the second while I was in the cockpit of an aircraft. The second episode felt like the aircraft had fallen on its side. The second episode being more severe than the first. An immediate change in axis it seemed. Both episodes left me nauseous with mild sweating. I experienced nausea and fatigue lasting between 24-48 hours afterwards. There was no chest pain or palpitations. I did have a lingering headache after each episode of dizziness. I was evaluated at an UTC after the first episode. I was treated with Meclizine but it has not alleviated the symptoms. I followed up with my doctor who advised symptoms were not associated with BPPV or vertigo.  Requested an MRI of the brain which was completed and was unremarkable.  The dizziness has continued since the onset of symptoms above.

                                                Experience chest pain on right side of chest near armpit which spread across chest one week after the first vaccine shot given on January 25, 2021.  Pain was going away before the second shot. Received second shot on February 22, 2021 and had the chest pain return, extreme fatigue, headaches, rash at injection site and all over back, achy muscles mainly in upper body, dizzy spells, nausea, and abdominal pain. All these symptoms (minus nausea) continued for three weeks and some are still present (fatigue, chest pain and periodic headaches) after six weeks.   I was tested for antibodies and the results came back greater than 400, which is the max limit for the test.  The doctor has never seen results that high and we have no idea how high my antibodies actually are.   Since my symptoms seem to be slightly improving, the doctor did not recommend further treatment.  However, I am concerned as to any possible danger of antibody levels this high.

Got a shot, several medications and sent home, I told the ER PA that I had my first vaccine 7 days ago but she figured my symptoms were strictly vertigo which I have never had.  After doing some research I&#39;m finding others via the internet with the same symptoms after their shots, with sustained or prolonged side effects.  Currently headaches, imbalance, trouble focusing or brain fog.

                                                Approx 15mins after having the shot administered I sat in my car and felt the medication coming on by it clouding my vision then causing me to faint (and by description from my fiancé) I had what appeared to be a mild seizure. I was out for a minute or two and when I was conscious again my vision was blurry and I felt very drunk for the next 45mins - hour. I also felt like I could taste the chemicals from the vaccine when I became conscious again.  The drunk/vertigo feeling subsided slowly over time but I was given a Benadryl from the pharmacist so I?m not sure when the dizziness stopped but I definitely could not drive home. My fainting was not due to any anxiety due to having a shot or anything, I was perfectly fine for approx 10-15 mins after the vaccine then I felt a cold feeling coming on from my right shoulder then up my neck then I got foggy and dizzy and passed out

He returned to normal fairly quickly and went home by report. He presented to the ER shortly after with palpitations and shortness of breath and required a dose of IM epinephrine. Patient since had intermittent fatigue, dizziness, blurred and vision changes as well as tinnitus. On May 31, 2021, patient presented to the ER with headache, lethargy, weakness, diaphoresis and dizziness. Additionally, noted to have slurred speech by his wife. MRI of the brain done at 4 am on 5/31/21 showed  the following  &#34;1. Acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts are seen with a right posterior 4.3  mm focus a left middle cerebellar peduncle 3.2 mm focus and a left superior cerebellar 7.9 mm linear focus. 2. Occlusion of the left vertebral artery extending into the basilar artery with reconstitution of the basilar artery via bilateral posterior communicating arteries. Findings are concerning for acute dissection occlusion. Consider further evaluation with MRA head and neck. 3.

I had extreme uncontrollable shivering by 20 hours after injection. i nearly passed out at work. I also had nausea and burping.  By the next day(more than 24 hours after injection), I was completely fine.

I got up to use the bathroom and had a syncopal episode about halfway to bathroom. Fell and i came to immediately when my name was called.  I got back into bed.  My lips were white.  I still felt lightheaded but could breathe freely and easily.  There was no noticeable swelling impairing my breathing.  Initially i could not get a reading on my pulse oximeter.  After a few minutes it worked and by then i was at 95%. I suspect the oxygen was quite low prior to that.  For the next day i had a fever and farigue.  The day after that I had some lingering fatigue but no fever.  Right now I am not planning to get the second shot in the series.

I got dizzy and felt weak at points. I went to the Doctor and it was also determined that I was wheezing when he checked my lungs. He prescribed me a 30 day usage of the Albuterol Sulfate pump to help with the wheezing 3x a day.I saw the doctor January 23rd.3 days after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.

Pharmacist and another associate helped patient up who was conscious. He asked what happened and if he were standing.  He shared that everything went pitch black.  He was placed on chair; pharmacist asked if he wouldl like to lie down and he declined. He stated he had felt nervous and scared about imz before his appointment. Patient did cut his lip in fall and was given napkins for bleeding and a cold compress for face and neck. Patient waited with us for 2 hours. His BP was 154-74 and pulse of 54 ; patient stated he was a runner with low pulse. Patient arranged for a ride from family member since he lived far and was not sure about driving. I recommend that he place a call in with his provider.

                                                Began with severe fatigue and transitioned into severe shaking, body chills, aches that stayed for a prolonged period. In the course of trying to bring warmth to the body, I showered and ended up having severe vomiting. The body aches, fatigue, and overall sickness stayed with me for over 48 hours. Two days post vaccination, my left arm was swollen with severe redness. I am still struggling with fatigue and body aches (4 days later) but have regained mobility and strength.

He said whether if he was standing up or laying down he was dizzy.  He called his PCP and he was referred to an ENT Dr.  The ENT scoped his throat, the inner ear and nose. He found everything to be normal.  He will forward his results to PCP and he has an appt. on 3/4/2021.  Pt had these symptoms about 4 weeks.

                                                I have had a low grade fever (99.5)  for a week now.  I have had insomnia since the night of the injection.  EVERY night I wake up hot 3 hours after I went to sleep.  I have never gotten the chills, only hot.   I usually need to take a sleep aid to get back to sleep which is NOT normal for me.   Many times I wake up again 3 hours later even after the sleep aid hot.   My lack of sleep has really been hard on my daytime working and living at this point.  When I wake at night hot my temperature is usually 99.5, but has been a bit lower at times too.   I also feel that I have rapid heart rate at this time (when I try to fall back asleep)  and it seems as if my heart is beating harder than normal.  I also feel a buzzing in my head like I drank too much coffee type of feeling.  The first couple of days I felt tired and weak and a bit achy throughout the day.  The next few days after that I felt dizzy and light headed with a headache.  The first few days I also noticed slight muscle spasms throughout my arms and torso particularly when I laid down at night to go to bed and was still and relaxed.  I have been taking over the counter pain/fever pills usually for the headache.  I contacted my doctor and he said to give it a week.  It has been a week yesterday, but Dr is closed for weekends and Fridays.  I went to urgent care on Friday and they were not helpful (virtually).  They said give it 5 more days!!!!!   I am extremely tired of this and worried at how long it has been.  NOBODY I know with the first shot has had this reaction.  My wife is nervous as well and we would really like to hear something that may ease our minds at this point.  Some explanation as to why my body may be reacting this way, or if any others have had this same situation.

                                                I was feeling cold throughout the day, at about 9:00 pm I took a shower to try to get warmed up, I just kept getting colder and colder until I was severely shaking uncontrollably. Every muscle was so tense and I was shaking so badly I could barely walk or breathe. I went to the bedroom and got under blankets with a heater and in a few minutes the shaking diminished to where I could start breathing normal again. It took about an hour before my shakiness went away completely but I still needed to stay under the blankets and near the heater as I felt I was still cold and on the verge of getting the severe chills again. I had no fever. Next morning (as I&#39;m writing) I&#39;m still worried about getting out of bed as I still don&#39;t feel right and am scared of getting the chills like that again.

                                                Felt extremely warm, started feeling lightheaded, started sweating profusely, vision started blacking out, got very close to blacking out and fainting. I was seated at the time, waiting the 15 minutes for observation after the shot, symptoms happened about 10 minutes into the waiting period.  I was given some cold water right away, over the next 10 minutes my vision started coming back and I stopped sweating. Was told I looked flush when they first came over but was looking much better after another 10 mins.   I stayed an additional 30 minutes for observation after the event and had friends come take me home and get my car. I&#39;m still feeling very slightly light headed and somewhat tired 2 days later, but otherwise feeling great.

                                                On 3/16/21, I noticed a rash which closely mirrors what is being described as &#34;COVID arm&#34; at the site of the injection.  This appeared after 72 hours of severe stomach pain and loose stool, combined with fatigue, dizziness, chills/hot spells and lack of appetite.  There has been no fever with any of these symptoms.  The other members of my family who live in my household (Spouse - who also has had one dose of the Moderna vaccine, and our children age 12 and 15) all experienced the same set of symptoms, except the rash at site of vaccine injection.  I thought we had all caught a stomach bug from each other, but now I wonder if my symptoms were related to the rash that I first noticed this morning.

                                                Narrative:  He states experiencing mild disorientation/fog and mild dizziness ~ 20 minutes at the initial vaccination. While he was still oriented to person/place/time, he states having difficulty in trying to find his car (no issues reported during the 15 minute waiting period). Both concerns resolved w/in 5 minutes spontaneously. He had not had a prior similar reaction to a past vaccination. Denied pruritus (other than over injection area), urticaria/hives, flushing, swelling/angioedema, lightheadedness, weakness/difficulty ambulating, syncope/LOC, SOB/dyspnea, tachycardia/palpitations, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, abdominal cramping. He has no allergies that he is aware of and was able to work afterwards. RN reviewed common adverse effects and when to seek care. Advised 30 minutes of supervised post-vaccination wait time. Reinforced to alert staff if he experiences any of the adverse effects we discussed related to concerns for immediate allergic reaction. Patients intention is to return to work today (works with health care professional). He was checked on during/at the end of the observation period and reported no issues.

Mild pain at injection site within a few hours.  3am (9 hours after injection) I went to the bathroom, and while standing got dizzy and lightheaded tried to sit down.  Collapsed while trying to sit down and hit head on bathroom floor.  Cut right eyebrow on floor.  Tried to get back to bed and was in and out of consciousness for 30-60 seconds per spouse.  Vasovagal response symptoms.  Cold sweats.  I was very thirsty and drank a tall glass of water.  5 minutes later I stood up and went back to bed feeling fine.  I slept the rest of the night and felt fine the next day, and for the rest of the weekend with no other symptoms.

                                                Immediately following the second COVID shot in my left arm, I began experiencing numbness and tingling in my left arm. The pain would go to my funny bone area, and down my forearm to my middle finger. It feels exactly like when you hit your funny bone very hard. At times the pain is a discomfort and a tingling, but there are days when it is so sore I can&#39;t use the arm. The pain has been consistent for 3 weeks now.

                                                After first dose I experienced severe L shoulder pain for 2 days. Couldn&#39;t move it well, could not sleep on it. Pain started 4h after injection.  After second dose I started experiencing L shoulder pain after 40 minutes. Pain was so severe I could not put my hand into the packet. In the evening the same day I started running temperature 101F that last 3 days non stop. I started experiencing severe chills, could not stop at times shaking! I was hot and cold every so often. I started experiencing same evening severe body ache which was constant and felt like I was squeezed by some machine. I could not sleep, I felt just terrible,  couldn&#39;t find comfortable position. My heart beat resting was 110 per minute and it stayed like that first night. My normal resting pulse is 60-70 bps. I did not have headaches or nausea. At night everything felt worse. After 3 nights temperature subsided but I was exhausted and my temperature dropped 95.9F my normal temperature is 97.88F. ( 36.6C) . Since April 2nd I have been tired and I want to sleep all the time.

On Monday, 4/12/2021 at 12:15am (about 6 hours after injection) I developed chills and body aches.  Throughout the night I also developed a headache, muscle aches, nausea and started sweating.  At 9am (4/12/2021) when I woke up, all the symptoms continued (chills, body aches, muscle aches, arm soreness and stiffness, headache, nausea) and also felt extreme tiredness.  My temperature at 9:15am was 100.4 degrees F.  I basically stayed in bed and slept most of the day.  I got up at 2:30pm to get something to eat and had a temperature of 101 degrees F.  After eating, which made me feel even more nauseous, I went back to bed and continued to sleep.  I woke up at 7:30pm to feed the cats.  I felt the same as I did at 2:30pm--listed above--and was up and about for 20 minutes.  I started to prepare a quick meal and fainted twice (around 8pm) within a minute from each other.  The first time I fell to my knees and the second time I felt onto my back.  I was unconscious for only a few seconds each time.  I went into bed after and placed an ice pack on my forehead.  I took my temperature after the ice pack at 8:15am and my temperature was 101.4 degrees F.   I ate soup around 8:45am and took Tylenol (1000mg) at 9:30am.  I went back to bed and slept all through the night.  This morning (4/13/2021--2 days after injection) I feel much better--only have some slight chills and arm soreness.  My temperature at 9:15am (4/13/21) was 95.7 degrees F.

The headache and tiredness got worse over the weekend but the arm got better.  On monday (4/5) while dealing with worse tiredness and headache I got a migraine around 3:30 pm/  tuesday(4/6) the symptoms got worse but the migraine started at about 1:00pm.  Wednesday thru Friday the migraines were so bad i could not attend work or get out of bed without a great amount of effort.  During these three days the pain in my back became more pronounced.  The pain went from the to of my skull to the belt area of my back .  The pain followed the spine mostly and spread out along my belt line.   I saw my primary doctor on Friday (4/9)and received a Toradol shot.  Many blood tests and covid tests were performed and nothing abnormal was found.  The symptoms got a little better for the next two days.  My work has a 10 days from symptoms before being allowed to come back to work so i was home until today.(4/18) I start work again tomorrow(4/19) but i still have extreme tiredenss, aches and headache.

                                                I received a shot on 7 April. A couple of days later, I received a phone call from a health facility stating, vials of the vaccine were stored outside of the temperature range recommended by Moderna, which affects the viability. The person on the phone recommended I get another 1st dose. On April 21 (2 weeks later) I received a second 1st dose, and I experienced strong side effects. Yesterday morning I had a 103-degree temperature, chills, dizziness and weakness, along with tremendous muscle pain in the injection area. Also, the injection area has a bright red circle and is hot to the touch. I said to the vaccine administrator that the injection did not feel similar to the first one because it hurt going in. She responded with that the worst part, and now it&#39;s over.

He said it just didn&#39;t feel right. When he got his first vaccine, he didn&#39;t even notice it. He noted that this second vaccine was given much further down than his first vaccine was given.  He noted that it was given approximately 7-8 cm below the acromion process. His arm was sore that day but it improved after 1 day. Then 7 days later, he had severe pain to his shoulder and upper arm. He woke up and he could not move his arm. He got up and had his son massage it and then after some time, it loosened up and he could move it.  He still has limited range of motion of his arm due to pain, his strength is decreased, the pain radiates down his arm, and the pain is impacting his work and daily activities. The pain is worse with rest.  He describes it as throbbing.

At approximately 1800 hrs the same day, I experienced a sudden onset of muscle spasms to my lower back. I was at rest, sitting in a chair at the time of onset. The muscle spasm to my lower back was extremely intense and I had difficulty walking. This continued for about 1.5 hours. Also, during this time, I experienced cramping to the arches of both my feet. This was intermittent. I also had pain/soreness to my hips bilaterally. After approximately 1.5 hours the lower back spasms and cramping to my feet subsided.  I do not have a history of lower back issues and this is my first experience of spasms of my lower back.

I started to get dizzy and was sweating.  Called over the Fire Dept personnel who were administering the injections and they helped me (fluids, ECG, etc.).  During this time they stated that my blood pressure dropped to the low 40&#39;s (not sure the exact number) and my heart rate as well.  My complexion was pale to them and sweating a lot.  After administering IV fluids a few minutes later my BP and HR started to rise.  My SpO2 was good.  Transported to ER for evaluation and labwork.

Then on April 9th around 4AM it&#39;s like someone turned my tinnitus up. It got significantly louder out of the blue. Was harder to sleep. I still hear it now while I am awake which I usually don&#39;t notice it. I also feel slightly dizzy as I walk around the house.

                                                On 4/10/21 around 2:30 pm I gave the patient his first Moderna COVID vaccine and had him sit in the observation area for the standard 15 minutes. Around 2:35 he and his family notified me that he was feeling lightheaded/faint and nauseous; he also appeared pale and diaphoretic. It seemed to be a vasovagal reaction until he said he was starting to have trouble breathing so I called 911 and got the Epipen/emergency kit ready, and monitored vitals. Then his breathing trouble resolved without needing to administer medication. EMS arrived at 2:39 pm and confirmed his HR/BP/O2 sat were normal. EMS cleared the patient to go home with his family. The patient had never had a vaccine reaction or vasovagal reaction before.

                                                On evening of initial dose, I had a very sore Arm at the injection site. I feel that it was extremely different from what others describe. I could barely lift the arm without a lot of pain. I wasn&#39;t too worried about it as I knew it could only be sore for so long. It faded throughout the next days. On 04/07/21, I woke from a sleep at 4am and as I rolled over, I had a massive wave of dizziness come over me. I thought it was very strange so I decided to sit up, in bed. As soon as I sat up, the room started spinning. It felt as if I were drunk as a skunk. I managed to steady myself and got out of bed and went to the bathroom, all the while fighting the dizziness/vertigo. The dizziness/vertigo has prevailed since then, but at a diminished rate. It is better if I am up and moving and worse if I am sitting/laying around. I&#39;ve waited almost a week to file this VAER but feel like it needs to be done.

He went to bed and at 4:00 AM he started throwing up profusely and was intense and periodic until it lasted until 8:00 AM (4 hours).   He has stomach problems, but not to the extent of this.  He has been trying to control his other problems with Alka Seltzer which normally helps with his regular stomach issues, but did take 3 of them during that 4 hour period which seemed to calm his stomach down, but normally one takes 1.   His stomach is feeling better right now other than having loss of appetite, eating small bites and minimal.   Feels he may have fever right now but not feeling well enough to get up, sweaty and clammy on the back of his neck right now.  Feeling weak due to the 4 hours of vomiting.  He has not called his doctor.

The following day, or the 3rd day after the shot, I had several bouts of what I will call extreme heartburn.  Severe burning sensation across chest after eating and tingling down both arms. Painful and physically limiting on Thursday 4/15/21.  On Friday the &#34;heartburn&#34; returned after eating but a little less severe.  Slight headache was still present.  Saturday and Sunday were progressively better.  Monday 4/19/21, almost back on a regular diet.  Slight tenderness in abdominal area when palpated.

Then within 20-30 seconds I realized that my chest was heavy/pressure on my sternum, arms and torso went warm and sweaty, a bit light headed and had fast heart rate. I asked medical team for assistance. They took blood pressure/O2 levels and listen to my heart and lungs. Had epi pen ready, but never administered. Watched me like this for about hour and a half until my bp came back down to normal levels.

                                                About 12-15 hours after my shot I started to feel general malaise.  By 6am on 1/16, I had a bad headache and felt nauseous, and dizzy. These feelings lasted until 10pm on 1/16/21, and then I went to bed and felt better in the morning.  I was barely able to get out of bed that day (1/16) because of how sick I felt.  Besides the sick feeling,  I had bad pain at the injection site, and had a 3cm x 3cm raised red lump at the injection site.  This stayed painful for 48-60 hours, then the swelling subsided and was left with a bruise.

Interferes with sleep, regardless of position (&amp; unable to lie on left side).  Unable to elevate shoulder overhead into flexion or abduction d/t pain (limited to ~45 degrees).  Tenderness over lateral shoulder/SIT tendons.  Positive impingement sign.  Seems to be tendon/shoulder injury d/t faulty injection technique.  I had minimal shoulder soreness after the first injection.

                                                Since receiving Moderna shot #1 vaccine I have experienced three gout attacks. It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

                                                About 3-5 minutes after getting the vaccine began experiencing a light headedness feeling. Took my blood pressure and it was a little high (140/95), I attributed this to anxiety but got home and my BP at home was down to about 120/76 about 1 hr. after. I laid down to sleep it off but could not sleep as about 1 hr. after trying to go to sleep I started to get a headache. After about 2 hours of battling it I decided to take a Extra Strength Tylenol which helped with the headache about 2 hrs later is was almost gone but the feeling of lightheadedness/dizziness was still there a bit worse than at the beginning. I slept it off and the next morning it was about 50 % better and by about noon it seemed to be 99% better. Today is Thursday ( on my 3rd day) and still feel a slight dizziness but I also have seasonal allergies which sometimes give me the same symptoms. I expect to be better soon.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

                                                A few minutes after the shot i started getting dizzy. it increased with intensity so i flagged down an attendant for help. I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

His vitals were stable at BP 133/95, HR 90, Pulse ox 97% on room air. His symptoms persisted so 911 was promptly called. Dr. came and assessed patient and he was found to have clear lungs with no abnormal heart sounds. When EMS arrived, his vitals were very similar and still stable. Patient was taken to Hospital. I spoke with him the following day, 4/7/21, and he reported that his labs were all unremarkable and they treated him for a panic attack and he was feeling well by the time he got home.

                                                Patient received Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. About 10 minutes after injection patient was not looking well. I escorted him to a private area where he continued to be light headed, pale in appearance, and communicated in short sentences. While sitting patients BP was 60/40 and pulse was thready. He was placed on the floor with legs elevated and EMS called. Lungs were clear and normal, heart tones normal as well. No sings of angioedema at any point of his episode. 3 minutes later BP increased to 80/60 with a stronger radial pulse, and a recheck again about 5 minutes later resulted in a BP of 110/72 with regular radial pulse. EMS arrived and assessed patient. He refused transfer to hospital. He was given time, water, and a small meal as he had not eaten or drank much of anything through is night shift. After about 30 minutes he was able to ambulate through the auditorium and stated he was feeling much better. We encouraged him to take the remainder of the day off but he declined and returned to work. He stated he would return if any symptoms were to reoccur or if he had any concerns. He will have his next dose of vaccine in clinic.

                                                Patient called 4/21/21 at 2:08 pm and said at 6 AM he woke up in a &#34;pool of sweat&#34; and started vomiting &#43; chills. No fever. He vomited once and has been nauseous since. He feels very dizzy. He was walking down hallway, and he &#34;blacked out&#34; and fell down the stairs. He said he did not hit his head, but the right side of body hurts, as well as chest, after the fall. He said this pain is causing some difficulty breathing. He said his dad witnessed the fall. When asked if the pain is severe, he said &#34;yes&#34;. He was told that if he&#39;s experiencing &#34;severe&#34; pain after a fall, accompanied with difficulty breathing, he should seek medical attention. He was told he can contact his Dr. for a second opinion first, if desired. Otherwise, it was suggested he check his BP, if possible, sit with head between knees or lay down with feet propped up and NOT walk around if feeling dizzy. He was advised to stay hydrated and introduce bland foods first to see if he can tolerate solid food. He was told he can take whatever oral pain reliever he normally takes that he&#39;s allowed to take if needed. Patient will report back to me.

Patient was educated on s/s and need to visit ER if symptoms recur.

                                                I woke up on Sat April 17th the day after my 2nd dose of Moderna and went to the bathroom. I was sitting on toilet and next thin i know i&#39;m waking up on the ground looking at the shower. I had blacked out. I then managed to pull myself up and was looking at the mirror in my bathroom and next thing i know i am waking up.  I had blacked out again.  My wife then discovered me on the floor and helped me up and to bed.  There is a cracked tile in my bathroom so i believe i knocked my head pretty good. I felt woozy and had a large scrape on  my right shoulder from one of the falls.  I was put into concussion protocol by wife;  The rest of the day i had the normal side effects of moderna: Fever, chills, headaches, sore left arm, and took tylenol extra strength, rested, hydrated, etc.  I felt better later in the day and by the next day Sunday April 18th i felt much  better;  I was able to drive and get errands done, but felt &#34;Foggy&#34;.  I felt back to 100% maybe by Tuesday April 20th.  My concern is the blackouts not being known. If someone was operating heavy machinery or driving the day after their 2nd shot and blacked out that is a major cause for alarm.

We had staff sit next to him in the waiting area after his vaccination.  About 1&amp;1/2 min post vaccination he started feeling light headed and sick to his stomach.  He let our staff know and I immediately went to check on him.  He was sitting on floor, then decided to lay down because he was feeling sicker.  I took his BP and it was 100/60.  He said the top number normally runs around 160.  His skin was cool and he was sweating all over.  We called 911 to evaluate the pt.  While we were waiting we put his feet up on a pillow and got him some water.  After about 5 min he decided he wanted to try and sit when his color started coming back.  We got him to a sitting position and the medics finally arrived.  As they were checking him he felt bad again and laid on their cot.  Their evaluation was that his numbers were all fine.  He was feeling better and they got him to a standing position and he was able to walk out of the store.

                                                I received my first Moderna shot on March 22 and my second on April 19. I had very bad side effects both times, though the second was worse with chills, dizziness, some light fever, body aches, sweating. This lasted up to two weeks after my second dose. I hardly ever take sick time off, but I had to leave work several times due to vaccine symptoms showing up.  A month later, around May 15th, I started to feel a waxy feeling on the roof of my mouth and I had noticed even before this that I couldn&#39;t whistle like I normally can. By May 23, I went to the ER for facial paralysis on my right side. I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. At this moment it&#39;s just my face, no other body parts.

                                                Patient was light headed and sweaty after 10 minutes getting the shot.  I was talking to him the whole time to make sure he is conscious. It seemed he lost consciousness  twice but came  back very quickly. Patient said he had lack of sleep the night before so we do not know for sure if the reaction was just because of vaccine or there are other reasons behind his reaction. By the time 911 came patient was ok and could talk and communicate well. they took him to ER for more exams.

Nest day woke up with severe pain in left arm from below the site of injection (upper triceps) region down to the elbow , got severe enough to not be able straighten my arm fully without major discomfort.  Took Advil 800 mg , that made it better but not completely. By evening time felt like i was tired and like what i feel like when i am about to get a cold.   Next day was not tired , feeling of getting sick was no longer there and pain got slightly better by midday.   Next day after that woke up with slight swelling in the site and the arm was red and was warm to touch.  That continued for 2 days and gradually got less red and swollen and started to itch.  Took almost a week for the itch to completely subside.

                                                Within 6-8 h after receiving the vaccine, I noticed progressive pain on my left shoulder and upper arm.  I could not sleep on my left side. At 22 h after the vaccine I could not abduct my arm due to the local pain, became prostrated (had to lay down all day), lost appetite (only ate 2 cookies all day) and became very fatigued (went to sleep at night at 7 pm instead of my 10 pm regular sleeping time). I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence. I am fully vaccinated and this was by far my most severe vaccinal reaction.

Ten min after the first and ONLY shot, it felt like a rush and they brought me to the next room, checked my BP and HR.  177/111 and 115 bpm.  Got better after a bit, and went home. 28 hours later, my heart started racing at home, drove to the WR and it was 133-145 Beats and BP was 180-120.    Went to the ER again tonight for being light headed,  did the EKG and it was normal.  Tonight I woke up three times with a heart rate of 90

Patient felt week to the point he could not walk. Denies headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, SOB, chest pain, cough, N/V/D, abdominal pain. Denies recent illness or sick contacts. Wife and patients denied any symptoms prior to receiving Covid vaccination. Past Medical History includes: metastatic clear-renal cell CA; receiving nivolumab/ipilimumab. SoluCortef 15mgAM/5mgPM initiated on 12/31. Last chemotherapy received on 01/22/21; S/P left nephrectomy In the ED, patient was started on vanc/zosyn/azithromycin, SoluCortef 100 mg, IVFluid and levophed (for MAP 62-64). Patient was admitted to the MICU for undifferentiated shock. Hemodynamically stable after weaned off low-dose levophed . Etiology likely infectious vs Adrenal insufficiency vs reaction to COVID vaccine. SoluCortef decreased to 50mg q6H. Acute kidney injury; likely secondary to shock.

I woke up I believe in the early morning hours a couple of days later in pain.  The pain caused me to wake up.  After that I noticed that my elbow joints, and knee joints were very sore.  I was unable to flex my arms (mainly right arm) or knees (mainly right knee) after that for approximately two weeks without feeling pain.  Extremely sore joints starting in arm/elbow joint followed by extremely sore knee joints.  Overall body aches mainly in joints.  Persists to the time of this writing

Achiness, chills, muscle pain, fatigue, headache persisted Thursday afternoon and evening.  On Friday morning, began violently throwing up and continue to throw up everything attempted to eat or drink for 24 hours.  Threw up approximately 15 times.  Could not hold food down until Saturday.  All-day Saturday suffered chills, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and began to hold food and drink down. At 12 noon on Saturday began to have excruciating joint pain that progressed in right hip to the point where I was unable to walk Saturday evening.  Took one 200 mg motrin and was able to sleep Saturday night. Woke up feeling much better on Sunday morning. Still experiencing mild fatigue and moderate joint pain in right hip.

Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

While I do report my daily progress on V-SAFE it does not allow for detailed reporting and it does not have a radio button for hot flashes that WILL NOT GO AWAY.    Approx 30-60 min after the vaccine I did get a headache which has continued (still have it).  I did get dizziness and fatigue which has somewhat subsisted and has gotten better (comes and goes) but the headache remains and now I have hot flashes that came out of nowhere last night.  It continues with the headache.    Nothing has changed from my routine nor have I been around anyone new or traveled recently.

                                                My arm was sore for 3 days as though I had been punched really hard.  After that  my deltoid became incredibly irritated and I started having stabbing, excruciating pain in my should any time it moved.  This lasted until I went in to get a shot of local anaesthetic from my doctor  on 2/25/21.  I was taking advil, tylenol, a muscle relaxer, lydecane cream and then I got the shot of anaesthetic.  I slowly had a little bit of improvement in mobility.  13 days after my vaccine, I was no longer experiencing shooting pain in my shoulder.  It is now March 1st and I think I have regained about 70% of my  mobility in that arm.  I believe that the shot made my deltoid flex and freak out and this ended up causing bicep tendinitis.  This is also my doctor&#39;s theory.

                                                He got the vaccine, started to get the headache within 45 minutes, ran some errands and after a couple of hours he felt like something was burning on his buttock, and noticed a really bad red rash on the left side on the left cheek from the crack outward. It was extremely hot to the touch and very sore, kind of throbbing and swollen and progressively got worse. He was just not feeling well, nauseous and dizzy and went to sleep but when he woke up it had spread to the other cheek. It looks like he got burned or scalded red/purple in color. He has no reaction on the arm itself, but only on the buttock and a blistery, blood red, leathery feeling rash/blotch on his entire buttock to both hips on both sides. It is difficult for him to sit. He also had headache, the muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea.  He did not vomit but had not eaten anything. He has had a high fever up to 103 until this morning 4/8/21 which is about 99-100.  He woke up soaking wet today. He has not been able to turn his neck, and not able to lift his arm above his waist level since the vaccine, and not able to turn his neck to the left at all. He can turn it 5-10 degrees, but right is okay. He took some Benadryl over the last 2 days for the reaction but it has not. He also has taken aspirin/Aleve for the fever. He was so sock and had no energy and could not sleep but could not keep his eyes open either, was not able to open them. He did write his doctor when the rash was only on one side, which they did not give him any advice as he was not feeling any worse at that time. He was at 101 fever throughout the day and then at night went to 102. He was hoping that the rash would be better, but actually worse as described above. He has not had any appetite, trying to drink fluids but made him nauseous, and he normally drinks water all day long. His normal temp is 97.7. He has been taking showers to try and keep his fevers down and the water hitting the rash feels like somebody is pouring scolding water on it. He did call Moderna on 4/6/21 asking if this was a reaction that anybody has reported, and he is waiting for somebody to call him back.

Woke up at 2:15 AM and couldn?t move. My arms and hands and feet were completely paralyzed. Couldn?t speak or call out. Slowly started attempting to move fingers and feet and head. After several minutes was able to roll over on stomach. Could not move. After several minutes of attempting movement was able to push myself up and grab a piece of furniture. After several more minutes was able to get legs to move sufficiently to walk to bathroom by holding onto furniture and leaning against walls and door jams. Still feeding feeling feverish with chills. My son took my temperature with a forehead scanning thermometer and it registered at 100.3. He said my skin felt extremely hot. Took 1000 mg acetaminophen.  Finally was able to go back to sleep around 4 AM and slept for a couple more hours. Woke up just before 7 AM and was able to stand and walk with some effort. Currently 9:30 AM and still have aches and pains and difficulty walking.

Progressively worsened over the next week until I had sever pain-8 out of 10 in joints of both shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and the left foot/ankle.  Pain became debilitating and went to local medical clinic.  Ran blood tests. A week later pain worsened and went to ER.  Could barely get out of bed, walk.   ER doc put me on a tapering course of Prednisone for 12 days.  Almost complete relief of joint pain within 4 hours.  Once down to 10 mg per day the pain returned.   Had a GP telemed appointment and doc put me back on prednisone-30mg per day.  Not complete relief of pain but certainly better than nothing.

There was no rash that presented below the waist. The rash was accompanied by a low-grade fever of 99 to 100 Fahrenheit and lasted for over an hour from the time the adverse event presented.

When I walked back into the room he was pale and sweating, but responding to questions from the person he arrived with. His arm twitched a few times and his head rolled to the side for a few seconds. Then he regained consciousness, but momentarily looked confused. The patient has a history of seizures, but has not suffered from one in 10 years. After that, the patient remained alert, but continued to sweat and felt light headed for most of standard wait time post vaccination. After the 15 minute wait period the patient felt more normal and left.

Rash is still noticeable on both arms but less irritating. I had minor psoriasis on leg that seemed to get worse after 2nd shot.  Also within the last 10 day I fell and got 2 minor cuts on my arms. Usually, my cuts heals very quickly, but the 2 cuts I received did not heal fast. They were slow to heal and almost leaking puss. Overall, I feel my skin is slowly healing after any issue with cuts or rashes or minor psoriasis. In addition there were times up to the last week where I would feel very tired around midnight and just had to go to sleep. I normally don&#39;t go to sleep till after 12:30AM, but I was so I tired that I would be in bed by 12:00AM.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the shot, I began to feel flu-like symptoms beginning with intestinal discomfort and incontinence. Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

                                                Injection administered on 1/4/21 and was given in upper left shoulder joint opposed to the deltoid muscle. I completely removed my shirt to assure proper placement.  Common soreness to shot experienced next two days after administration, however soreness felt in shoulder joint rather than muscle. Pain re-occurred on 1/12/21 and has not been totally relieved despite the usage of anti-inflammatory medication eg. Ibuprofen 400mg,  Tylenol 500mg along with Ibuprofen for soreness. The worst pain I experience is when I go to sleep being prematurely awaken by aching and throbbing to my affected area. Again, not being any discomfort to muscle but rather left shoulder joint pain where sometimes I am discouraged from raising my left arm to my side. It does not bother me so much to raise my left arm towards my front. I have been working through my discomfort while being very careful not to aggravating it further. My concern comes from the fact that it has not completely gone away after the extended time frame and becomes more intense in the evening.

Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

                                                On 12 FEB 2021 I received my first dosage of the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine, Lot 016M20A. On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back. In the evening of 13 FEB it was noted that the pain in the left hip became more generalize:d vice the specific point pain that I have witnessed off/on since SEP 2020.  Continued to note evening pain that felt like burning/tingling pain on both feet.  At this point the pain in the evenings appeared to be worse than the AM pain.   Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 It should be noted, that left shoulder discomfort from the injection never exceed 2/10 as it appeared 24 hours after the injection.  More pain in shoulder associated with mobility/rotation? I lacked the ability to simply walk through the house due to the pain throughout the past 36 hours.   14 FEB: Less discomfort in AM, but still greatest in left foot. Left Foot: 7/10 Fight foot: 4/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 3/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 4/10 PM:  Significant increase in pain at bed time. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 15 FEB: AM: continued lessening of pain/discomfort in AM, but appeared back throughout the day, worsening at evening.  Pain in left hip was noted to be much more pronounced shooting out in multiple directions, to include causing discomfort from the rear of the hip, and when seated shooting pain in the direction of my inner thigh from the back of my hip.  Pain in feet continues to be like a burning/tingling pain in the evening, most pronounced in 2nd and 3rd toes on my left foot and big toe and little toe on my right foot.  The pain also appears to be much greater at evening than in AM. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: Left Hip 8/10 right hip 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10-not much change-very point specific pain.. I am not witnessing fatigue or any other problems other than joint/musco skeletal pain.  I have also not been getting shooting pain in feet that has appeared from time to time which feels like someone hammering nails into individual toes or shots of violent pain, only a sustained burning/tingling pain. four days later the Psoriatic Arthritis locations continue to rage following the vaccine, most notably bilateral feet and left hip, where the pain in the hip appears to be radiating in multiple directions.

Periodic severe headaches continue, although these existed before receiving the vaccine and are linked to positive COVID in Nov 2020.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

                                                Severe shaking to the point I could barely walk, talk, or function in general. In fact, had to end work conference call due to effects.  In desperation, I have my wife help me into a hot shower where I continued to shake violently for about 25 minutes.  My wife continued to monitor me to make sure I didn&#39;t collapse or pass out and continually ask if we should go to the ER.  However, after about 25 minutes the shaking subsided and I was left exhausted with some minor muscle pain due to shaking.  It was very difficult to breath during the incident, noticed my hands turning blue so I focused on deep breaths and staying calm to eventually stop it.

We sat patient down to monitor and took BP and pulse rate (120/59 and 60). After a few minutes, patient stated he was nauseated and still feeling dizzy. We continued to observe patient and after a few more minutes he stated he was starting to have intermittent chest pain. We then contacted 911 to request assistance. While waiting for EMS to arrive, patient stated the chest pain was becoming more constant. At this time we also observed patient was very pale, sweaty, and his skin was cold to the touch. EMS arrived quickly and took over patient care, stablilizing him and then transporting him to the hospital. We have not received an update on his condition at this time.

Specifically being light headed, loss of all energy along with an upset stomach  and slight headache.

                                                Sunday morning, around 12:10am, I started getting chills/trembling/body shakes and my muscles all over my body ached. I was so miserable all morning I couldn&#39;t hardly sleep and later that morning, I could hardly stand for more than 5 minutes. That lasted all of Sunday and I maintained a mild headache. I drank a lot of water all day and ate very little.  I thought it would pass by the next morning. At 2:30am Monday morning a 2nd wave hit me, I had more trembling/ body shakes, this time it lasted for a little over an hour. I woke up again and again through the night and in the morning I had a terrible headache and nausea and vomited to the point of dry heaving. I slowly drank water with electrolytes.  At around 6pm Monday, I am finally starting feel normal again and made a meal of eggs and bacon with toast and felt fine afterward. I have had no other symptoms since that day.

                                                Intense vertigo, similar to what I experienced during my previous vestibular neuronitis events.  It&#39;s effectively inflammation pinching the vestibular nerve, which can only be helped by reducing the inflammation with steroids.  Treatment was prednisone for inflammation, zofran for nausea, meclizine for the vertigo symptoms, and zyrtec for reducing fluid build-up due to allergies.   Extreme symptoms lasted 4 days of absolutely no movement or even open eyes, then 2 weeks of limited ability to move, now able to function, but still feel slightly dizzy.  My doctors believe the vaccination contributed with general inflammation, which, combined with the allergies, triggered the event.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of SEIZURE LIKE PHENOMENA (Seizure like phenomena) in a 49-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 011A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Vagal reaction (patient stated he has experienced vagal responses to injections in the past).    On 02-Mar-2021 at 5:46 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Mar-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE LIKE PHENOMENA (Seizure like phenomena) (seriousness criterion medically significant). 02-Mar-2021, the patient experienced BREATH SOUNDS ABNORMAL (Breath sounds abnormal), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), DYSKINESIA (Dyskinesia), EYELID FUNCTION DISORDER (Eyelid function disorder), FALL (Fall), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOPNOEA (Hypopnoea), HYPOTONIA (Hypotonia), MUSCLE TWITCHING (Muscle twitching), PALLOR (Pallor), PRESYNCOPE (Presyncope), RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (Restless legs syndrome) and TREMOR (Tremor). At the time of the report, SEIZURE LIKE PHENOMENA (Seizure like phenomena), BREATH SOUNDS ABNORMAL (Breath sounds abnormal), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), DYSKINESIA (Dyskinesia), EYELID FUNCTION DISORDER (Eyelid function disorder), FALL (Fall), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOPNOEA (Hypopnoea), HYPOTONIA (Hypotonia), MUSCLE TWITCHING (Muscle twitching), PALLOR (Pallor), PRESYNCOPE (Presyncope), RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (Restless legs syndrome) and TREMOR (Tremor) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 02-Mar-2021, Blood pressure measurement: 120/72 (normal) 120/72 mmHg. On 02-Mar-2021, Heart rate: 64 (normal) 64 beats per minute. On 02-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 99 (normal) 99%. On 02-Mar-2021, Respiratory rate: 20 (normal) 20 breaths per minute.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications were provided.  The patient remained in the vaccination chair for 5 minutes after injection and he reported feeling well and moved to the observation chair without any problems [~10ft].  After being in the observation chair the patient stood up and took 4-5 steps toward the wall and sat down on the floor.  The patient stated he felt dizzy and then became limp and slumped to the right side, his eyes remained open with dilation of pupil fixed at 2mm with no blinking noted.  The patient&#39;s breathing pattern became shallow and snoring sounds were noted. The patient did not respond when spoken to nor did he respond to soft shaking of the shoulders.  The patient began to demonstrate large jerky body movements similar to seizure activity. The seizure like activity continued for 3-4 minutes before the patient was able to become aware of surroundings and answer orientation questions. The patient was diaphoretic, pale, shaking of hands and arms, restlessness of lower limbs with frequent repositioning/twitching of legs.  EMS (emergency medical services) arrived to find the patient regaining stability. The patient reported to EMS that he is familiar with this type of response and declined to be taken anywhere.  Treatment medications were not reported.

                                                A week after my 1st shot, my knees feel incredibly stiff and achy. it hurt to walk up steps and had to do it one step at a time. I could not squat and rise from squatted position due to inability to push off with left leg/knee. Intensity varied day to day but was always an issue right up to a few days before 2nd shot dose when symptoms appeared to be dissipating. After my 2nd shot, symptoms were still continuing to dissipate for about a week. After a week, all symptoms returned in full force and have still not lessened a full 6 weeks after my 2nd dose.

I ended up with excruciating pain that landed me in the hospital for two weeks for extreme nerve pain to the point I can?t walk, sit or stand for long periods of time. I was given heavy doses of steroids, pain meds, IV fluids and met with a neurologist did multiple MRI?s and I?m left with severe muscle spasms and tremors the Drs can?t seem to understand why They said this is not related to back issues however they did a steroid back injection hoping it would help with inflammation and I was sent home after two weeks in the hospital. I?m at home and dear if my life doesn?t turn around I will lose everything.  I was a athlete with no prior previous existing health issues and now I can?t even leave my house without serious tremors and muscle spasms I?m on medication for seizures, muscle spasms pain meds and have a jacuzz I can?t even raise my leg to get into This ALL HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER I GOT THE VACCINE!!!! 1st dose I did have a bad case of COVID in December for the record.

                                                Injection was painless.   Within 5 minutes of vaccine felt dizzy and had heart rate into the 120&#39;s.  Duration approximately 5 minutes then tachycardia and dizziness resolved.  Also had a tremor.  No angioedema, urticaria or other skin/mucosal findings.  Was not anxious.  Arrived home and wife and children told me I looked flushed and noticed my pupils were significantly dilated.  The flushing and dilated pupils resolved over the next hour.  No shortness of breath or hoarse voice of any kind however my mouth felt extremely dry.  I did not do anything for treatment.  Spontaneous resolution.

                                                I awoke the next morning with chills, fever, headache, nausea, dizziness, and extreme fatigue. The fever broke after about 5 hours with 800mg of ibuprofen and 1000mg of acetaminophen. The nausea subsided somewhat with 8mg of Zofran sublingual. The headache resolved about 01:00am on 01/10/2021. The dizziness and fatigue resolved significantly by 04:00am on 01/10/2021. Mild fatigue continued for another 24 or so hours, but seemed mostly resolved by 01/11/2021 and may have been exacerbated by my overnight (7p-7a) shifts.

                                                Post shot developed the following within hours:  head congestion, dizziness, nausea, brain fogginess, phlegm in my heart, headache, inability to fully concentrate to typical ability, major soreness in arm receiving shot, soreness developed in arm that didn&#39;t receive the shot with intermittent shooting pain at opposite arm shot sight as if being stabbed with a knife.  Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

Left arm swelled up to the size of a goose egg and I was unable to lift my left arm from my left side.  Low grade fever, body aches, eyes looked sunken in, felt exhausted. I felt like I had the flu. I missed three days of work after the second dose.    I took ibuprofen and iced the left arm and rested.  I never had a reaction to the influenza vaccination in forty years.  The first dose, I did not miss work. And the side effects went away the next day.

Was monitored for another 30 minutes and my wife picked me up. Took tylenol when I got home. Checked blood sugar at home and blood sugar was down to 40. I hadn&#39;t eaten before the vaccine. I ate oatmeal and went to bed. After 2 hours, I no longer had symptoms. Returned to work 1/29/2021 without any further issues.

                                                Started with tightness of chest, (under the lower part of ribcage); sporadic hot flashes and dizziness; pulse going up to 95,( when normal is in the 60&#39;s).  Then sat down an hour later and almost immediately a deep tiredness.  got off work early, went home and had no other problems until I attempted to go to sleep.  Somewhere around nine o&#39;clock, I started getting muscle cramps so I went to the couch.  Shortly after, my right arm, (vaccinated arm) became extremely sore; shortly after, my total body ached; no relief from lying on my left, right, stomach or back; hurt to even sit upright.  Then, I started getting cold chills; which alternated with hot flashes and periods of nausea.  My mouth went extremely dry, so when I struggled to go use the bathroom, I would wobble my way to the kitchen and want to take a big drink of water, attempted to swallow two tylenol, gagged and started throwing up.  Went back to bed and started getting continuous headaches that would move to different places.  This happened the rest of the night and most of Thursday when most of the worst symptoms happened.  Was able to sleep Thursday  night and thought I was feeling better, until I stood up.  Today, I was not able to stand longer than one half an hour at any one point; had to lie down and rest while doing any kind of activity.  I haven&#39;t been able to keep anything down; either vomiting or diarrhea. Have been slowly feeling better with occasional headache.

                                                7pm on date of injection I got very sleepy and fell asleep.  I woke up at 12:45am sweating but chilled to the bone.  I felt feverish but was too cold to get out of bed.  When I actually got out of bed I had a very intense headache, and body aches.  I took my temp and it registered 104.  at 8am I took my dogs out but felt very old, chilled to the bone &amp;  lightheaded.  It was chilly outside.  I got back inside and got back into bed as fast as I could. The second I laid down, the sweat just poured out of my body, drenching my shirt, sheets, and blanket.  The fever lasted all day but was slowly improving throughout the day.  My arm was also incredibly sore at the injection site.  It was very sore for shot one too but the pain lasted nearly 2 weeks the first time and is already just about gone now.  Yesterday, or 2 days after dose 2 injection, the fever was gone.  I still had a headache, and body aches but also developed nausea.  I did not vomit but I did have diarrhea.  I also noticed extreme shortness of breath over very minor exertion.  I?m not sure if this was due to extreme dehydration , due to loss of fluids or if it?s associated with the vaccine.  My lungs feel clear and I deny ever suffering from a bronchial spasms..  Day 3 I?m feeling more myself but am still suffering from gastric upset.  Nausea has dissipated.

The burning sensation expanded to my left armpit area over the next few hours and extended to left side of chest. It felt like streaks of burn extending out of armpit area.  Approximately 12hrs after receiving the shot (3am) I became extremely nauseated. I alternated between throwing up and diarrhea for the next three hours. During this time i also experienced a fever, chills, sweats, uncontrollable shaking and elevated heart rate. Today (3/19) I am dehydrated, lightheaded and dizzy. fever and chills are gone as well as nausea but heart rate is still elevated.

                                                I don&#39;t think that my reaction to the vaccine is super serious but it is perhaps worth noting if others are also experiencing similar symptoms. On the second day, I did have the expected arm soreness around the injection area on my right arm. That soreness faded by Saturday morning. However, on Saturday afternoon, I began experiencing some intermittent pain in my left kidney. I have had a few (3?) kidney stones since I was approximately 35 years old so it is a pain that I recognize almost immediately.  I kept my spider senses awake to see where it was going to go. About an hour later, I had intermittent &#34;flu like&#34; pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn&#39;t seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out. I cannot 100% say that any of these symptoms are related to the vaccine. However, being a Type 1 diabetic (since 1978) and the unusual kidney pain made me go, &#34;huh.&#34; That is why I am providing this info in the event that there are others who are experiencing similar symptoms that can be tied to the vaccine and what to expect. I feel completely fine now. Yay. :)

                                                Aches and stiffness in the joints. Muscle aches. At the outset I was barely able to walk very slowly around my apartment.  Couldn&#39;t stay on my feet longer than a couple of minutes. It got  less severe with time, but not very fast. I was able to take a walk outside again for the first time 6 days after the shot. Today, a week after the shot, my knees still hurt, and I still don&#39;t feel like I can run.

                                                After I got the shot, on the way home, I started feeling tingling on tongue and lips; had a metallic taste. I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

I was fine for the past week but then 8 days after my shot, my arm got a small red rash at the injection site, it was itchy, and a little sore - I got the so called &#34;Covid arm&#34; or &#34;Moderna arm&#34;.  It came out of nowhere.

Since last seen he initiated AIT in December 2020 and reports he had tolerated his AIT injections without large local or systemic reactions until yesterday, 16 Mar, when he received his first maintenance dose. Within minutes of receiving his dose he developed shortness of breath, dizziness/altered level of consciousness resulting in collapse, and was noted to be hypoxic. He was treated with IM epinephrine with initial improvement but subsequently again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness. He received his second dose of IM epinephrine and a dose of IM Benadryl with transient improvement, but again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness followed by nausea and vomiting. He was noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic despite these interventions so a third dose of IM epinephrine and IV fluids were administered. He was transferred by ambulance to ER where he was given IV solumedrol, monitored, and admitted to the ICU overnight for observation. He reports fever (Tmax 101 F) last night in the ICU. He endorses he took his Allegra prior to his AIT dose and did not exercise. Of note, on 15 Mar he received his second mRNA COVID19 vaccine.

He then developed neck pain, tingling that goes into right and left arms/fingers. Was started on oral steroids by his PCP on 4/6/21. Given worsening symptoms and new development of urinary retention. Patient was admitted to Hospital 4/8-4/11. Suspected to have cervical transverse myelitis.  Re-admitted 4/12 due to worsening generalized weakness, significant numbness, gait/coordination issues, and several falls. Differential diagnosis includes guillain barre syndrome vs. transverse myelitis. No MS on brain MRI. No cord lesion. Treatment included IVIG 0.5g/kg daily x 4 days, B12, 1 mg IM daily x 3 days. bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  4/7: MRI cervical spine: Small focal area of increased T2 signal within the central cervical cord at the C2 level without associated postcontrast enhancement. A demyelinating disease is leading differential consideration. 4/11: MRI brain: normal, no de-myelinating disease; MRI C-spine: severe cervical stenosis with flattening of spinal cord but no cord edema/enhancement.

                                                This is a 50-year-old male who got his first Covid vaccine last Thursday, April 8 and then he said on Saturday he began to feel weak and off balance.  He also began to feel tremulous.  He apparently said that on Saturday his right leg was shaking so bad he could hardly walk.  He denies any numbness but again feels off balance.  He has fallen down several times since Saturday.  He apparently went to urgent care and then was sent to the emergency department for evaluation.  His blood pressure was noted to be 194/130 on presentation.  He does have an obvious tremor in his left arm.  His significant other says that he at times had slurred his words.  The patient does not know what type of vaccine he received on April 8.  The patient due to these symptoms presents to the emergency department now for evaluation.  He apparently drinks about 8 to 10 cans of beer per day and has done so for an extended period.  He denies any loss of vision.  Patient was not a candidate for alteplase.  He was admitted on 4/12 and discharged on 4/14. Discharge medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and losartan.

                                                Patient came in for first Covid shot. After the vaccination, he was instructed to stay for 15 minutes in the &#34;post vaccination&#34; area. He went and sat there and I walked back into the pharmacy to finish the paperwork. I then was alerted by a customer that the patient fell off the chair and hit his head. I ran over to him and by then, he was back in his chair and just realized that he had passed out. While I was with him and talking with him, we paged out for code white. I had instructed one of my techs to call 911 as he was pale and palms were sweaty. I had him walk over to the IMZ area and had him lay on some towels and had his feet propped up on a chair. He was given water and I kept talking with him until EMS arrived. They checked his vitals and were asking standard questions and after about 15-20 mins, he was feeling better and didn&#39;t want to go to ER. By then, his coloring was much better and he stated he was feeling a lot better. I asked him if he had a headache and he says that he didn&#39;t have a headache and was more embarrassed than anything. He thanked me for my professionalism and care and assured me that he felt back to normal. I called him 2 hours later and he was doing well.

                                                Got his vaccine, that evening he felt as if his face was on fire like a windburn.  The next morning had an incredible cold chill as soon as air hit him, bone shaking.  Then had cold chills/sweating with soaking of his groin area.  He can go to sleep with extreme chills and then wake up in a puddle of sweat.  He had a headache at first, took Tylenol and it went away.   Numbness in his foot like it&#39;s falling asleep, left hip hurting, left wrist pain.  Today both calves hurt./sore like workout burning pain.  Two days ago his father went to have bypass and was at the hospital with him, and walked painfully in but had difficulty hobbling along and was unable to walk back to his truck and had to borrow his dad&#39;s cane to be able to walk.  Yesterday he was going to cut the grass, knelt down to do something, and when trying to stand up was not able to walk due to the throbbing pain and had to use the cane again.  Also having swollen left ankle with discoloration.  The calf pain is extreme and throbbing, and the pain when he&#39;s not able to walk is in the calf.  The ankle has been swollen since Sunday, 4/18/21.  He spoke with the ICU nurse in the hospital and he told her about it and she grabbed his ankle and asked if he was sure he didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  He has not been able to shake the symptoms.  The issues with walking are intermittent, some days he can walk fine, the other days he has to use the cane.    He still continues with every day hot sweats/cold chills.  It&#39;s 74 where he is right now and has a sweatshirt on as he is cold.  Also the legs hurting, ankle swelling that he ices down at night but the swelling does not go away.  Feels like a hard knot in his ankle.   He has not sought any treatment for this at this point.

                                                First dose on 3/5/2021 received with minor issues of slight pain in injection site later, but also some tingling in injection site. SECOND DOSE on 4/2/2021 was a different story.  About 15 hours later at 3:00 am I woke up with 100.5 fever, SEVERE pain at injection site (like someone had punched me in the arm and bruised my arm), and SEVERE level 9 (out of 10) pain in all joints in my hand and two big toes.  Fibromyalgia muscular pain SEVERE level 9.  Headache, SEVERE fatigue - could not get out of bed very well.  SEVERE brain fog - I could barely think logically.  I tried taking 50mg full spectrum CBD oil to avoid taking an NSAID (I was concerned it would affect proper immune response).  At 6:29 am the fever was lower, but I could no longer take the pain, so I took 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil).  4-6 hours later took another 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil) and stayed in bed and slept several times that day.  For the next two days the severe brain fog and severe fatigue remained.  I continued to take 400mg Advil as needed.  The brain fog was so severe that if I picked up my keys (or any other object), I would immediately ?lose? them and not know where they were because I had placed them somewhere else and could not remember anything.  I stayed home for at least 72 hours due to the fatigue and the fear of driving and possibly getting in an accident.  It seems the high severity of the issues lasted 72 hours, but all of the above reported issues continued for several weeks at a lower severity - with fatigue being the worst - requiring one or two naps per day.  As of today, April 29, there is still slight pain in all hand joints and some fatigue, but there seems to be gum issues (hurting) since about April 26th.  I am brushing my teeth lightly, using ?Smart Mouth? zinc oral rinse, and sucking/chewing on a whole clove every once in a while for pain relief and for the anti-biotic properties.  I did not contact my physician because I read online that people with Fibromyalgia have worse side effects and I figured the effects would subside over time.  I have an upcoming appointment with my doctor on May 26, 2021 at which time I will report these side effects and my strong concern about any future booster shots and the severe side effects I may encounter.

This graduated to constant dizziness and cloudiness and severe shaking while outdoors.   Arrived at ER at about 10am  and &#34;room spinning&#34; vertigo began shortly after and at about 11am there was about 5 episodes of severe vomiting over about a 2 hour period.  Dizziness did not decrease until enough medication was administered to stop the vomiting and allow a dose of Meclizine 25mg PO to be administered and take effect and decrease the dizziness to barely manageable.  Left the hospital in this state at about 6PM.  Today is 4 days later and dizziness continues as manageable only with Meclizine 25mg every 8 hours.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                Right after the vaccine I just had a slight head ache. I had pretty typical symptoms. Around 8pm my arm got to 8/10 pain. I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

Patient was breathing but unresponsive, stiff, and unable to blink, talk, or move for around 2-3 minutes.  Once the seizure ended I asked patient if he had a history of seizures, his answer was, &#34;not really&#34;. He drank some of the water and sat with the ice pack for a couple minutes and said he felt better. Color returned. Patient stated he felt nerves contributed more than anything and was feeling 100% better when he left. We had dialed 911 while patient was unresponsive but once he was able to talk again he declined 911 and stated feeling much better.

                                                Got the first Moderna dose, 5 minutes later, my heart started raising, I got lightheaded, my hands cold, my throat narrow. Personnel took me to observation, my blood pressure jumped up to 204, my heart bit to 190, felt like that for 15 minutes, then my BP started to come down. They called an ambulance took me to the hospital, in the ambulance my BP came down to 170. Go to the ER, blood test ok, after two hours there BP came down to 130 they released me. FYI, 51 year old man, very active, I can run a marathon (26.1 miles) in 3:45, Im not diabetic, I dont take any medication, I dont have high blood pressure. Dont know what that  happened, no insurance, now waiting for a bill from the hospital, not to mention Im scared to death now taking the second dose.

I was only able to lift my arm above my head with assistance from my right arm. Eventually I was able to lift my arm without assistance and the same phenomena happened the third evening where my shoulder was frozen and immobilized.  The frozen shoulder has abated but there is still moving poi&#39;s of major swelling in the upper arm. There has been persistent but slowly abating symptoms of deep soreness, arm weakness and weak grip strength. Swelling persists in the upper front portion of left shoulder. I can not do extended tasks with the arm because it does not have strength nor stamina.

Difficulty functioning normally: walking, ascending &amp; descending stairs and simply standing in place.   Symptoms worsen at night, knees become frozen and have to be adjusted with hands.

                                                He took his vaccine and his arm was a little sore right afterwards.  His arm hurts more today and is having trouble lifting the arm.  He has chills, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, fever, headache.  He has not taken anything for his symptoms, just wanting to sleep.     He is allergic to the flu vaccine and he told them that before the vaccine and they assured him that he was ok to get this.  He probably will not get the 2nd vaccine.

Dizziness, headache and fatigue have been experienced since, with occasional shortness of breath. Dizziness has at times been severe, as has headache. Fatigue has been severe throughout, with me sleeping much of an average day. I will be seeing my primary care physician Monday 4/5.

                                                SYMPTOM 1 - Pronounced persistent vertigo 7 days after Moderna Shot #1.  Very healthy.  Never before experienced vertigo of any significance.  Degree of vertigo strong for entire first day undeniably present/persistent and varies (slightly improved, then worsens again) since day 8. Able to get through day but disturbing. Extremely healthy otherwise,  extremely athletically capable.  Nothing unusual in diet or sleep or activity or stress in recent days.  SYMPTOM 2 - Ringing ears on day 11, and increasing on day 12.  This too - never before of any significance in entire life.  Could it be related to the vertigo symptoms?  Feels like it is.  *** Please take note! *** Hard to dismiss as unrelated.  I&#39;m just one.  You have the sample data.  Seems as though auditory/balance nerves are getting a beating somehow.  This is NOT an exasperated pre-existing condition.  The shoulder soreness / tiredness - was a 1 day matter quickly resolved.  This is more insidious and persistent and debilitating.

                                                I had no symptoms until 28 hours after receiving my first dose I suddenly became faint and dizzy momentarily, lasted about 3-4 seconds.   I thought I was going to black out but did not, my daughter was with me so I know I did not actually black out.  Overall weakness, and fatigue like having the flu for the next 24 hours.   I did not seek medical attention at that time as I do not have a primary care provider.  I do intend on getting an appointment to be checked out as I cannot be certain this was due to the vaccine but I have never had this fainting feeling before.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Glaucoma and Hyperlipidemia.    On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 06-Mar-2021, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), ILEUS PARALYTIC (adynamic ileus) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking). The patient was hospitalized from 06-Mar-2021 to 31-Mar-2021 due to ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE, BULBAR PALSY, DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY, ILEUS PARALYTIC, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS, PNEUMONIA and RESPIRATORY FAILURE. At the time of the report, RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia), DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy), BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking) outcome was unknown and ILEUS PARALYTIC (a dynamic ileus) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-Mar-2021, Electromyogram: abnormal (abnormal) consistent with demyelinating neuropathy.. On 30-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported by investigator.  Patient was presented to hospital on 3/6/21 with progressive extremity weakness, bulbar weakness, and respiratory failure attributed to AIDP s/p 5days IVIG. He had received his first Moderna COVID vaccination approximately two weeks prior to this and immediately following administration began experiencing weakness and trouble walking. EMG 3/15/21 consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. Hospitalization was  complicated by the development of adynamic ileus which is improving and acute hypoxic respiratory failure (previously requiring O2 support). Patient was also treated for pneumonia with a 5 day course of azithromycin. Once medically stable he was deemed appropriate for inpatient rehabilitation and was transferred from Hospital to rehab on 3/31/21 under care. The patient tested negative COVID-19 on 3/30, and repeat testing since also has been negative.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose, I spiked a fever of 101, felt body aches and chills. This lasted for about 1 day. On day 3, I woke with stiff, achy and sore joints in my right hand. On day 4, these symptoms remained in my right hand and moved to my left. Over the next week, stiff joints moved into my toes. EXTREME FATIGUE and mental fogginess also developed as did blood pressure spikes. On week 2, move joints started aching including knees, elbows and shoulder. On week 3, my fingers were so sore and stiff it became difficult to use door knobs. I contacted a virtual doctor to ask for direction. He assumed in was side effects and prescribed me Diclofenance Sodium 75 mg for pain. Two days later, I went to the emergency room as the pain, fatigue and fogginess was becoming very concerning. On week 4, I was finally able to see my family doctor. He assumes it is a overactive immune response to the vaccine and prescribe Prednisone 20 mg to overcome the symptoms. The course of Prednisone has decress the severity of my symptoms but on week 5 I continue to have stiff, painful joints, mental fogginess.

                                                About 4 hours following the 1st part of the vaccination (i.e. around 8:30 pm), I felt the skin of both my cheeckbones swelling and flaring up. By the following morning, I felt that skin area, as well as the area around both of my eyes to feel as if I had sustained second degree burns. Additionally, the skin around my eyes particularly, presented with extreme dryness and geriatric symptoms, such as wrinkling and streched thinned skin, as if I were an elderly person (over 75 years old, and not 52).  The flaring/burning subsided after 4-5 days. However, the skin dryness around the eyes has persisted to this day (i.e. 5 weeks past the 1st vaccination). A day after the 2nd part of the vaccination, I felt moderate dizziness and headache, which lasted for about 24 hours. Also, light soreness and skin stiffening were experienced at the arm location where the shot was adminmistered.

                                                No reaction to first shot. Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

                                                Patient did say before vaccine that he has fainted in the past from previous vaccines. I had a Representative administer vaccine while i stood next to patient and talked with him as a distraction from the shot. After Representative gave the vaccine patient asked &#34;did you give vaccine?&#34;, he then immediately started to sweat very hard and said he was light headed (he was sitting down), then his eyes rolled back and he slouched down in chair, at which point I held him so he did not fall on floor. He started to jerk and twitch, perhaps was having a seizure, and was sweating very hard. I held him in chair so he would not hit his head or get hurt. After about 30 seconds he regained consciousness and asked how long he was out. His T-shirt was soaked in sweat and he said he felt very dizzy. The Representative got him an ice pack and placed at base of neck, which he said helped alot.  I sat with him for 10-15 minutes until he said he felt fine. I asked if he needed medical care and he said he did not, just needed to sit for awhile, and said this has happened before. I gave him a chair to sit in after he was fully alert and he sat for close to half an hour, at which point he said he was back to himself and felt fine.  I did offer he could stay as long as needed and I could call anyone if he needed me too, he insisted he was fine and after about 45 minutes he left. I did call him the next day to check on him and he said he was fine.

After going to sleep early in the afternoon I woke up light headed. I spent the weekend having trouble breathing. On Monday I used a sick day because of shallow breathing. Tuesday my light headedness went away but I was having trouble with my bowels.  That may have been due to snacking on cashews though. Tuesday night I ate some watermelon and drank two 32 ounce bottles of gatorade and I feel a lot better today. Breathing is still shallow but nowhere near what it was. It is back to being indicative of my morbid obesity

                                                Started with headache 15 min after shot.  That was on Thursday afternoon the 8th of April.  We are already the 14th of April and headache has not gone away once.  Body aches and joint pain are still present.  Snapping my fingers hurts the joints in my hand.  Walking hurts my knees.  Fatigue has set in and is still present.  VERY tired all the time.  All I want to do is sleep.  Dizziness all morning.  Taking about 2 to 3 hours for dizziness to go away.  But present again at intervals during the day then again the next day.  This has gone on since day two of shot.  Dry mouth.  I am drinking LOTS of water.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Open heart surgery. Concomitant products included POTASSIUM, FUROSEMIDE (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]), WARFARIN, METOPROLOL SUCCINATE (TOPROL XL), MINERALS NOS, VITAMINS NOS (PRENATAL VITAMINS [MINERALS NOS;VITAMINS NOS]), CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) and ESCITALOPRAM OXALATE (LEXAPRO) for an unknown indication.    On 11-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required), VERTIGO (Room spinning) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required). The patient was hospitalized from 19-Mar-2021 to 21-Mar-2021 due to TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. On 21-Mar-2021, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack), VERTIGO (Room spinning) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient received vaccine in right non-dominate deltoid muscle to prevent COVID-19. Patient was admitted to hospital from 19Mar2021 to 21Mar2021 for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scan, with observation and Low-Dose Aspirin. Patient was feeling much better and his cardiologist recommended that he receives his second Moderna vaccine as soon as required and to take an extra Vitamin D supplement as a precaution. Scheduled second dose was due on 08Apr2021. Treatment included was low dose aspirin.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                We have a man that we vaccinated last week with moderna. He is 52 yo. He had his first vaccine at another store on 3/31 and his second vaccine with us on 4/14.  That is only 15 days apart. He said he got notification from us that a vaccine was available and he read in material (he thinks but isn?t sure) through the county that said he could get it in 2 weeks from his first dose. So, when he got the notification he thought it was ok to get his 2nd dose. He did however have a scheduled appointment with the other store for his second dose for the correct date. He did bring his card with him to vaccine clinic that had the date of his first vaccine on there. He said when he got his second dose he had 24hrs of feeling dizzy, 12 hrs of chills and 8hrs of feeling nauseous. He is not wanting to get another vaccine because he doesn?t want to go through those symptoms again

                                                15 minutes after the shot, I became lightheaded in the waiting area and felt like I was going to black out.  I seemed fine after, and shrugged it off as I sometimes experience this on a rare occasion. Thought it was my anxiety from all the drama hearing about side effects. They kept me for 40 minutes and asked me a few questions and felt that I looked and acted normal.  My ride home, my vision seemed &#34;off&#34; and again, I shrugged it off to anxiety.  I also had light heart palpitations.  I get these sometime when I&#39;m stressed, overly tired, too much coffee, or have anxiety.  I wasn&#39;t dizzy at all, but my balance felt a tad &#34;off&#34;  I was much better in the morning and back to normal within about 24hrs.   I am worried about geting my 2nd shot as I read people being dizzy and with super high blood pressures......  Hoping these &#34;symptoms&#34; were just from myself getting worked up about..... possible side effects and allergic reactions.

                                                Patient came in to receive second Covid vaccination and stated that after his first shot he suffered a stroke.  Patient stated he received his vaccine and about 4 hours after started experiencing lightheadedness, dizziness, and overall feeling unwell.  Patient stated that he called the pharmacy and we verified that what he was experiencing could be related to the vaccine but to seek medical attention if his symptoms progressed or felt unmanageable.  Details were not given further but patient ended up in the hospital and had suffered a stroke.  Two weeks later he had a second one.  Patient stated he was seen by a neurologist who did not believe that the covid vaccine caused this as it was such a short time from vaccine to onset of symptoms.  He stated he was ok to get his second one per the physician.

Over time began having neurological symptoms including short term memory loss and numbess and tingling in the cheeks as well as shakey arm and hand on right arm only.  Symptoms on face started and right and have moved over to the left side of the face. Continued memory issues off and  on. Memory issues include getting lost while driving and inability to spell.

With in 15 minutes he had 2 waves of this reaction. The 3rd wave started about 20 minutes after shot and he said it was worse, tingly in both hands , funny feeling like he was going to faint , cold and felt like his pulse rate was up . He never fainted. He kept talking to me. Since the 3rd wave  was worse and it lasted the longest, we call 911. They came and checked him out, but he declined to go with them to the hospital. He waited in the store for at least 1 hour. Checked on him at home at 3:05p.m. and he said he felt fine.

CT scans were inconclusive so I was transferred (9:45 PM 2/25/21), admitted and an MRI scheduled for 24 hours later. MRI (12:00 AM 2/27/21) was negative for stroke. Beginning stages of Bells Palsy was diagnosed. Prescribed Prednisone, Lipitor, Valtrex,  and baby aspirin upon discharge 1:45 PM 2/27/21).  By 2/28/21  symptoms had increased to the point where I can not suck through a straw, speaking is difficult and overall, extreme loss of muscle control in my face and feel like I have a bad head cold.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

Had to use my right hand to move my left hand. The experience was comparable to what is described as &#34;falling asleep&#34; , the exception is that there was no tingling sensation. This lasted for approximately 5 minutes. Upon getting out of bed this followed by approx. 2-3 minutes of light headedness. Joints in both elbows and wrists are sore, more so on the left side.

On the morning of March 12, 2021 I had a serious case of vertigo and had to be transported to hospital.  The event lasted several hours and I was admitted overnight for observation.  The problem corrected itself within 12-18 hours.  I have had no follow-up  occurrences.  The episode occurred less than 10 days after my first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine shot.  I cannot confirm that the event was the result of a side effect, but I have never had vertigo before an all other heart, MRI, and CAT scans eliminated all common causes of vertigo.  An ENT doctor did not note any inner ear problem.  I don&#39;t know if this was a side effect, coincidence, or something unrelated, but wanted to report it just  in case.

Immediately, the injection site was sore, but after 24 hours I experienced body aches, headache, fever, light-headedness, and a lack of balance.  These symptoms persisted for approximately 48 hours.  Therefore, I was unable to go to work on Monday due to my symptoms.  I treated symptoms myself with rest, fluids, Ibuprofen, and Tylenol.

                                                Shortly after receiving the shot, I had combination of headache/head pressure, which went away after about 2 hours. Somewhere in 36-48 hours later, I began having headaches (clearly aches, not pressure).  These were like my concussion headaches (but I hadn&#39;t had been experiencing such strong headaches for a while). These lasted about 2 weeks. Along with the headaches, I got lightheaded very easily. I also noticed my heart rate was lower than normal when I did light exercising (and maybe even at rest, too). I had been experiencing the headaches and lightheadedness when my concussion was worse; I figure some connection / recession brought about by the vaccine. Neurologist attributes the response to inflammation.

                                                TWO lower GI tract infections, each one about two weeks after a vaccine shot. Other worries are confusion and bp oscillation.  DETAILS: 1st dose only minor flu like symptoms then 14 days in, big GI tract infection tennis ball size in lower GI followed by UTI and Colo-rectal infections. Gas and no stool passing.   2nd dose down  24-72 hrs later with serious chills and internal fever in main body cavity. Slept it off and hydrated. Then consistent flu like symptoms but stronger and longer than 1st shot. Increasing confusion and maybe dementia? Some 3-D visual dreams too?  lots of inflamation feel in body wherever old injuries were. Also blood pressure going high and low even though I cross checked with both electronic wrist version, and mechanical armband version of bp monitors. Consistent frontal lobe head pressure, bp oscillation, and flu like feelings (upset stomach, change in urine and stool color, wooziness, chills, etc.). Thank goodness for coffee! It helps clear up my mind a bit.  Then again, 14 days beyond second shot roughly, and the only reason I filed the report, another lower GI tract infection. This time I hit it right away with potassium penicillin 800 mg. This worked the first time too. Just an FYI in case others are showing  GI tract version/issues. I believe this was a secondary form of Covid symptoms in early Chinese data if that can be trusted.   Still not in good shape but it sounds like second shot causes more issues. I will probably schedule general checkup with my doctor if I dont get better in a week or so.

All symptoms can be exertional or non-exertional.  Have underwent inpatient hospitalization for the above and undergone multiple testing.   Have had a CT of the chest, CXR, echocardiogram, cardiac stress testing (chemical), EKGs, multiple labs, and heart catheterization.   All testing has been essentially normal including ruling out inflammatory process.

After comparing where the shot should have been we determined it was probably just part of the process and he continued to take Motrin and Tylenol.   4/22/2021 - After more than a week he is still unable to raise his arm half way as from his muscle to the top of his shoulder is pain.  We contacted our family physician who indicated she had not heard of the pain from the shot lingering for more than a few days.   She advised him for the next 48 to take 1000 MG of Tylenol and 800 MG of Motrin for the next 48 hours.  4/23/2021 -  We are currently following her advice however it does not seem to be helping the pain at this time.

                                                Approximately 48 hours after my second Moderna Vaccine I started experiencing breathing difficulty and shortness of breath. After 58 hours was admitted to emergency room but CT scan of lungs and heart normal. Breathing difficulty continued 24 hours a day until 8 days later in which the breathing difficulty became worse and increased light-headedness occurred On 4/13. A second trip to emergency room happened on 4/13 another CT scan of lungs and heart normal. Breathing difficuly continued until On April 24th I collapsed and blacked out while out for a walk. Was admitted to emergency room on the 24th and remained hospitalized with brain fog, light-headedness, breathing difficulty and sharp pain in right side of chest. Ecco cardio gram test negative. Breathing difficulty, lightleadedness and chest pain have all been steadily increasing since 48 hours after the 2nd Moderna vaccine shot. To date, still no answer as to why this is happening and getting worse.

I am unable to get the lot number of the vaccine because it was entered through the state  system and the lot number did not go over. No lot number is associated with the vaccine.

                                                The following is an email the patient wrote to us describing his events:  I received Moderna Covid Vaccine on January 4, 2021 and February 1, 2021 at Medical Center in  On the evening of January 12, 2021, I arrived home from working as a Pharmacist following a 13 hour shift at Medical Center with no medical complaints.  Later that night I experienced a severe coughing, sneezing episode where I was gagging on the mucous. I spit out a bunch of stuff and did a nasal rinse. I took some cold medicine like Certrizine and Mucinex-D.  Simultaneously with the coughing episode I developed a tingling sensation on the right side of my body from my neck to my toes. I also noticed that my temperature sensations on my right hand was different from my Left hand. I had gotten a water bottle from my refrigerator that felt room temp to my right hand but was cold when held in the left hand. I was feeling dizzy or drunk and was walking funny. When I tried to walk straight forward I actually drifted to the left as I walked. I was having difficulty swallowing medications, food or liquids.   I wondered if was experiencing the onset of Covid Symptoms. I was well enough versed on stroke symptoms to be worried about one sided tingling and altered gait being from a stroke.  The flu like nasal symptoms and altered right sided pain and temperature sensations persisted through the night, so I went to the ER at Medical Center the morning of January 13th. The ER worked me over with multiple Covid/Strept/Flu tests, evaluation for possible stroke (with multiple scans and stroke score.) The ERP also evaluated the possibility of Bells Palsy or Guillain Barre secondary to Covid vaccine the week before.  The Covid Testing was Negative. The stroke score was low enough NOT to have warranted thrombolytic therapy. The neurological issues did not appear to be Bells palsy or Guillain barre.   After the ER Visit I attempted to see a neurologist. May 25, 2021 was the earliest available appointment that I could obtain. The symptoms were not severe enough to prevent me working as a Pharmacist. The altered pain and temperature sensations remain without much improvement even now 4 months later.  The Neurologist diagnosed me as having had a stroke, specifically left sided Lateral Medullary Infarct, also known as Wallenburg Syndrome.   There have been reports from the other vaccines having caused blood clot issues since my event.

By the time they called me in for testing I told them I felt vary noxious and ended up passing out on the nurse after they took my blood. They transferred me from that chair to a bed in the blue pod, gave me nausea medication and hooked me up too 2 vary large IV bags and ran them at the same time. Then being up for 4 hours then sleeping for 4 hours and waking up wet in a pool of sweat continued for 6 days in total. the hot and cold flashes and sitting in front of a space heater went on for 12 days in total. waking up in a pool of sweat went on for about 28 - 30 days in total decreasing in severity along the course of time. The only side effect I still have is my sleep is all screwed up now. If I stay up untill 4 am I will sleep to 10;30 then wake up tired and stay in bed untill 11;30  am. if I go to bed at 2 am I wake up at 6;30 am have to use the bath room then can not go back to sleep for at least a hour then do not wake up untill 11 30 am. Normally, I used to goto bed at 2 -3 am and wake up at 9 -10 am every day.  on wednesday april 7 th, the doctors office which is part of the same group as the hospital called me to go over the results from the emergency room, but the person calling did not seem to know I had called them on monday morning or they had called me back to tell me to go to the emergency room, so I do not know how much of a help the PCP will be,  but I have proof of that in the phone call records.  MY PCP is no longer with the practice, so I had to choose a new one

                                                Dizziness started in the early morning approximately 12 hours after vaccination. The sx&#39;s come in waves and affect my balance. Sx&#39;s are sometimes exacerbated by change in position and first occurred whenever I rolled over in bed. The sx&#39;s also occurred while sitting at a desk working on my computer.  No benefit from Eply&#39;s maneuvers. No nystagmus with Dix Hallpike maneuver.  Meclizine seemed to be helpful. Sx&#39;s have persisted this morning, 1/4/2020.

But the adverse symptoms started about 5 hours in or so, i developed a cough, and dyspnea, it was tight in my chest, hard to breathe.  the cough was/is (it remains), sometimes hard and raspy, i was a bit wheezy, and I had air hunger, like i could not breathe or get air.  if i exhale to strongly i cough, if i talk to much i cough, if i sing i cough, if i inhale too deeply i cough.  I also have been very dizzy since the shot and vertigo.  I am still coughing and it is 5 days post shot.    I started developing headache and severe body pain, pain in  my spine, low back and joints.  which is expected, but i also had scalp pain and it hurt to be even touched the slightest bit on my scalp and everywhere on my body.  I had very stiff neck and eye socket pain as well.  I also feel &#34;funny&#34; in my head.  LIke dizzy, and vertigo, but also like it is wrapped in a heavy towel and my eyes feel heavy and like i can&#39;t see well.  my vision is as if it has diminshed.    5 hours after shot cough started, and the dyspnea, i started feeling chills and deep squeezing ache in my arm at jab site, and soon had fever of 100.6, over night it went to 100.8 and i felt terrible, headache, body ache, restless.  but next day fever was 102.  it remained all day, i had zero energy slept the whole day.  no appetite, did not eat anything except a scramble egg which made me nausea.  fever remained all day at 101.8. over night.  next day temp was 99.8 (my normal is 97.6) and it was 99.8 all day.  Cough was persistent and really bad with the dyspnea this whole time and i still have cough 5 days out, just giving a timeline here.  by friday, my temp was 98 but i felt extreemly fatigued.  I went and got a covid test which was negative.  i saw the chiropractor and they helped my back and headache a little bit.  went home and rested.  cough has lingered, dizzy lingers, chest tight and sob lingers.  fatigue lingers.   Cough and dyspnea are NOT signs, the sheet i got for V-safe says right on it these are NOT expected.

                                                At 5 days post vaccination, patient developed severe left shoulder pain, originally thought to be secondary to chronic shoulder pain and a recent fall, over the next three days it progressed to swelling, severe pain, and limited ROM. He ended up being admitted to the hospital and CT scan showed development of significant soft tissue infiltration around sternum and sternoclavicular joints. This was originally thought to be infectious, but he never developed a fever or leukocytosis and we feel this was most likely an inflammatory process. I have no idea if this was actually a vaccine side effect, but given the proximity in both time a location and the known complication of shoulder pain with the vaccine, it seems reasonable to give you the information to monitor for other similar cases.

                                                Shot was on Friday morning. Right leg developed severe unmanageable muscular pain through upper hamstring and calf muscles; affecting ability to walk and put weight on the leg. Leg pain developed within 24 hours of shot; became increasingly more severe at 96 hours. Was taking Ibuprofen 400 mg 2x day. As a result I went to the emergency room Monday morning. Their diagnosis was muscle pain consistent with a slipped disk. The ran blood work to look at inflammation markers; one was slightly elevated. By Tuesday morning the pain had drastically receded; and by Wednesday (today) it is mostly back to normal.

                                                Patient was given 2nd Moderna vaccine at about 7:30. Patient was pale and diaphoretic and was lowered to the floor by RN and another patient receiving the vaccine who was a cardiologist. He had several beats of clonus and then woke up. He was awake when his first vital signs were obtained. HR 110, BP 190/96, O2 sat 100%. When he was more awake he was assisted in to a reclining chair. BP monitored every few minutes and dropped as low as SBP 104, HR 70-80s. Pt reported that he periodically syncopizes, last 6mo ago. He reported feeling lightheaded after seeing his arm bleed and be swollen after vaccination. After about 1 hours the patient&#39;s vital signs were stable but he continued to have symptoms of lightheadedness which worsened when I sat him up (though BP was stable). EMS was called and he was transported to the ED.

I thought these were normal side effects from the second shot, but when I had trouble moving my right foot by two days later, I went the emergency room.

                                                Sudden debilitating dizziness and nausea 1 week after 2nd dose of Moderna vaccination.  Unable to stand or walk. Vomited 8 hrs until dehydrated.  Went to emergency room and received IV fluids with Zofran.  Emergency room doctor prescribed  Meclizine and Zofran. The nausea subsided the next day however a only a slight improvement in dizziness. After 5 days of significant dizziness and not able sand or walk very well, I then visited the a health care Center. After several Dr diagnosed me with Vestibular Neuritis (permanent nerve damage) in the right ear after several diagnostic tests.  Dr. thinks  a virus caused inflammation and damaged my nerve in my inner ear.  I was put on a 10 day prednisone and my condition improved by about 50%.  I am doing physical therapy to retrain my brain to compensate for the balance that my inner ear provided.  I am improving but this may take up to 3 months.  I have never had a problem like this in the past. I have read several other cases like mine on the website where people got the vaccine and all the sudden Vestibular Neuritis set in.

I fell out of bed and couldn&#39;t get up. Finally got to my phone about half an hour later and called 911. I was taken by ambulance to the hospital and put in intensive care. My organs were failing and I was close to death. It was some kind of infection and I&#39;m still on antibiotics. Interveinious antibiotics at home.

                                                Had pain in my shoulder (and  neck on my left side) as soon as the shot went in. At roughly three hours after the shot, I felt I was slurring my speech (I had to make a very concerted effort to make proper sentences and not slur) and was very dizzy. I also was having a hard time with lights. For example, I was unable to look in the mirror in my bathroom as the lights above the mirror were too bright for me. At three hours after the shot, I had severe pain in my left shoulder. Overall, I felt as I had been sedated or drugged. I tried walking to the nearest convenience store to get some food and I felt I was experiencing vertigo. Several days after the vaccine I had a slight cough and sore throat. I am still experiencing a slight cough on some day sand a slight sore throat.   I had a subtle red patch in the left shoulder area a couple days after the shot. Eight or nine days after the shot, I had covid arm and had a very visible red patch on my left shoulder. I have pictures of this.  I have been feeling very tired and dizzy ever since the first shot. My glands in my neck under my jaw line are also swollen. I do not know if it is either  wise or safe for me to get the second shot, which is scheduled for this Friday as it seems that I still have not recovered from the first shot. Can my immune system really take another round of this?  There are a couple other things that I have noticed. I don&#39;t seem to be thinking very clearly and I have noticed a remarkable number of type-os and poor syntax in emails that I send at work; this is not normal for me.   Finally, after the shot, I noticed that my muscles, when doing a little exertion such as pushups, would build lactic acid quicker and more blood seemed to be delivered to my working muscles. I still have not regained my strength and tire more easierly when playing tennis or hitting against the tennis wall, for example. This is also not normal and not how I felt before the first injection.

Went to the hospital and was checked for a stroke. No stroke detected. While during the exam, my tongue started to swell up and they decided to insert a tube for breathing. Woke up on Sunday after the swelling went down and the tube was removed. Was released from the hospital on Tuesday. Maintained a fever that week and on Friday, my fingers on my left hand and my left foot started to swell again, almost passed out. Went back to the hospital for observation and treatment for a staph infection from the first hospital visit.

                                                Within 2 hours of dose he experienced severe leg pain and by evening had a severe case of what he thought was laryngitis. Leg pain continued to get worse until Friday and he couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Patient went to ER on Sunday morning because the pain was so severe he couldn&#39;t walk. The pain was in his knees, lower legs, ankles, and feet.  The ER doctor sent him to hospital to be admitted.  The patient was in hospital for 6 days.  The patient was given pain meds and a rheumatologist was called in and she diagnosed him with gout.  they treated him with 4 doses of Anakinra.  That medication helped.  The patient currently is in pain if he is walking around pain level between a 5-8.  The pain is less if he remains seated.  He experiences the most discomfort when standing from a seated position mostly in his knees.

                                                Note: May 24, 2021 the pharmacy that administered the COVID vaccines contacted me with some billing questions. When I mentioned my severe reactions, they told me they were filing a report upon my behalf. When done they told me it was the VAERS system and gave me a reference number (Ref-531994). I decided that not enough information would be in that report so wanted to submit myself because of my severe reaction and hospitalization. My PCP was not involved until after hospital for a follow up and I was seen by numerous doctors there, so I have no easy single POC until I dig more.

Apr 17, 2021 Wake to find tongue hugely swelled. Thought I&#39;d bitten in my sleep. Unable to eat, hard to swallow fluid past tongue. Lasts for a bit over 36 hrs. Apr 19, 2021 Knee pain begins spreading up thighs down calves. Pain also beginning in feet toes and ankles. Apr 20, 2021 Knee pain when bending prevents me from entering truck to drive.

Apr 28, 2021 Approx. 2:30 pm knee/overall leg pain begins increasing rapidly to higher than before level. Over next three days increases to point where I cannot stand/walk due to pain. Unable to sleep due to pain also. Apr 28, 2021 Same Day-Around 4:30 pm notice voice is becoming raspy. By 6 pm my voice is completely gone. I have no voice for next approx. 36 hrs.

May 3, 2021 Transferred by ambulance in afternoon to hospital. May 4, 2021 Begin seeing multitude of Drs. More bloodwork and testing. Still major pain w no relief.

Less each day but still need for stability. Still have knee pain. Have higher level of pain in feet.  I had/have a major reaction to the Moderna vaccine. This should be investigated and reported on. Thank you.

                                                He got his vaccine, had pain on the side of the injection and from there it grew to feeling aches and pains and then the shivers the next day.  He has had chills/sweating, fever that comes and goes, difficulty breathing as his nostrils block up, and has wheezing and when he gets up he&#39;s light headed and feels like he is going to pass out.  At night the symptoms seem to get worse, and thought that he had the flu.  He has bought everything for the flu and nothing has helped.  He then thought that he may have allergies and bought stuff for that and nothing has helped.  He has lost his sense of taste, he is extremely thirsty and could drink a gallon of water and his stomach hurts from drinking but his mouth is extremely dry and his throat is so dry as well.   He also has a nasty bad headache that is persistent and at night it gets to the point that he cannot seen and had lost his vision and could no see anything out of his right eye.  He called 9-1-1 and refused to go to the ER as he has no insurance and could not afford that kind of bill.  Yesterday his headache was so bad that he could not see out of the left eye, he has a fever of 101.5 right now and his head is killing him.  He has taken all of his medications that he has, medicated and nothing is helping the pain.  His nose is also extremely dry and he has no appetite, and ate last at 5:00 PM yesterday.   He also has vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sweats/chills.  He watches his diet carefully due to the diabetes, but has not measured it.     He is very concerned about his vision and his fever and headache was so bad that he could not see, and he&#39;s worried about that.   He also has brain fog as well, and cannot remember things, pounding, pulsating water.

Noticed that when my arm is to the side of my body, it started going numb- right arm. I also had to get up around 4 times to urinate a lot. I was getting night sweats. When I would get up, I had a slight head ache and dizziness. I still have it right now, the headache and dizziness. Even when I walk, I have to extend my pinky finger out so my arm will not go numb. As we are speaking right now, my pinky finger is going numb. Once I extend it out, it goes away, but when I put it down by my side, it goes numb. My whole body is sore as well.

                                                Presented to ED for evaluation of generalized lower extremity weakness, falls. The patient states that he carries a diagnosis of MS and typically is fully functioning without assistance of a cane or walker. The patient states that yesterday morning around 0900 he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was otherwise feeling fine but by last night (12 hours after the vaccine) the patient states he tried to get out of bed and was transferring when he felt his bilateral legs give out, causing him to slide to the ground. His wife then came to help and states that the patient was completely weak in the legs, and was unable to even lift his legs up to get back into bed. They then tried to walk him again a short time later and he again stumbled with weakness in his legs. Since that time, the patient states he has been minimally ambulatory and has been using a cane, but still needs large assistance to get around his home. The patient states he has baseline foot drop but feels this is worse in his legs today. He went to clinic this morning for his symptoms where he was noted to have an elevated temperature and was diffusely weak in his lower extremities. Given this, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies any weakness in his upper extremities or facial asymmetry. He denies sensation change in his extremities nor any recent illness such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or leg pain. He has no history of stroke. He denies any injuries or head injury, syncope from his falls. He was admitted to the hospital where he will receive further symptomatic treatment as necessary. No treatment provided in emergency department for weakness.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included dolutegravir sodium;lamivudine, pregabalin, and modafinil for unknown indication.  On 19 Feb 2021, approximately two days prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 011M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Feb 2021, after receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt unusually tired for midafternoon that day. The patient had suffered from chronic fatigue issues but never felt more tired than usual at that point in the day. The patient then experienced a black out and woke up face down with a bloody nose and head. The patient felt very dizzy, was not able to walk and crawled to their mattress and fell asleep. The patient managed to get himself to the Emergency room, a CT scan of the head was performed, and it was revealed that the patient had a fracture that had occurred before the vaccine and was not related to the vaccine. The doctor thought the vaccine however maybe related to the blackout or have exaggerated a concussion and have caused these delayed symptoms. No treatment information was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the event experienced a black out was resolved at the time of this report and the outcome of the events, felt unusually tired for midafternoon, woke up face down with a bloody nose and head, was very dizzy and couldn&#39;t walk was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and patient&#39;s skull fracture that had occurred before the vaccine the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-057947:Second Dose Case

My cousin let an attendant know and they sent a Paramedic over to our vehicle.  The Paramedic took my vitals (which I believe were all normal) and gave me a bag in case I needed to vomit.  I started to feel a little better about 20 minutes after the injection and chose to go home and rest rather than go to the hospital.  The 2nd day my arm hurt where to injection was given, I had a headache and was still a bit nauseous although I never did vomit.  I still did not feel 100% on the 3rd and 4th day and better on the 5th day.

I also had heart palpitations and the medic personnel took my heart monitor, it was 80bpm. About 45 minutes of monitoring,  my symptoms were slowly going away and I went back to work. That same night I felt fine and by the next morning I was feeling much better.

                                                I passed out and suffered a concussion. My wife found me on the floor when she heard me hit the ground. I was taken to the hospital and stayed for two nights while given numerous scans and tests. No indication of stroke or poor heart condition revealed by any of the tests. No other symptoms other than soreness (which could have been attributed to the fall).

                                                Initially just mild fatigue and &#34;brain fog&#34; but by the next day the fatigue  &#34;brain fog&#34;/malaise/disorientation was so intense I could barely stay awake and could not function at my desk job.  This continued at that intensity for about a week.  I couldn&#39;t do ANYTHING...was previously running 7 miles/day but in the past month since vaccine I have only had the energy to walk around the block one time.  The cognitive impairment has been debilitating at work where I can not concentrate or process complex topics.  I&#39;m an IT executive so this is part of my daily job and was no problem prior to the vaccine.  By the second week I was starting to make very tiny progress each day.  I would be OK for an hour or 2 after waking up but then the fatigue and malaise would return and I wouldn&#39;t be able to work.  This is often accompanied by headache.  Generally the duration of symptoms has been  getting shorter each day but very slowly. On may 9 my impairment was so great I couldn&#39;t even drive (was like being a bit drunk).  Finally, Monday May 10, the intensity of the symptoms was light enough that I was able to work a full day despite the mild headache and fog.  The same continued on May 11, so I hope I am close to being over this.

                                                High fever (103.3) on 2/21/2021 that lasted for 6 hours and stopped with ibuprofen.  Left arm soreness persisted for 3 days and stiffness in the left shoulder became more prevalent.  During the last 3 months, range of motion in the left shoulder has decreased, general weakness in the left arm noted and now there is severe pain in the left shoulder when moved in certain positions.  Large decrease in range of motion.  Can no longer reach across my chest with severe pinching on the top of the left shoulder joint.  Can no longer swing a golf club without severe pain and swing limitations due to range of motion decrease.  I saw my primary care physician last week and he has referred me to an orthopedic doctor.  My appointment is for Monday, June 7th in Stephenville, Texas.

                                                Approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine shot, I experienced sudden dizziness and nausea for approximately 1 minute. Also, my entire left arm looked a bit red, but no hives. It went away as quickly as it occurred. Approximately 30 minutes after that, I experienced nausea again( which was a bit more intense). It also lasted for approximately 1 minute then it quickly ceased. At 4pm (5 hours after the shot), I got a severe headache. I&#39;m not sure if that was related to the vaccine. I took acetaminophen and slept soundly through the night. The next day, I felt fine, and I have felt fine since.

                                                About a day later I noticed some itching in the back of neck and over the course of a few more days, it got worse and I started to see red welts developing on my neck, left shoulder, and left upper side of chest and back.  It was very itchy and starting to get more painful.  Then 10 days later some of the welts turned to scabs while new welts were developing.  Much more pain.  Also, I left shoulder started to increase with pain and was loosing range of motion.    About 5 days into the first shot, I spoke to my primary doctor and originally he said just a reaction to vaccine, use Alegra and that should  take care of it.  I contacted him 10 days into the vaccine and sent him pictures of the welts and he said it&#39;s very clear I have the shingles.  While he didn&#39;t say the shingles were related to the vaccine, the timing is very suspicious.  I truly believe something happened with the vaccine that caused this.

I had slight dizziness during the first shot, but only within the 15 minutes I was required to stay after the vaccine, however it did not last long and did not have any dizziness until after the 2nd shot.  I almost passed on on 3/27 (2 days after), have not but continue to have intermittent bouts of dizziness that I had not had before.  Fatigue also continues to be a problem.

The most troubling adverse reactions have appeared in the last two days, five days after receiving the vaccination. Those reactions include the following: vertigo, general feeling of unsteadiness, nausea, visual focusing issues, mental focusing issues, and weakness that is mainly in my arms and legs.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving vaccine patient experienced metallic taste in mouth, felt flushed, heart racing, sweating, and felt clammy. Blood pressure was elevated at 142/102. Patient states he drank a lot of water and after approximately an hour and a half of being at the clinic he felt well enough to go home. In the 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, he felt very achy, specifically in the bottoms of his feet. He felt so achy that he could barely walk. He also experienced a fever and did not take anything to help with these side effects because he reports Tylenol does not work for him very well. All adverse effects were gone by 2-3am on 3/14/2021.

                                                1.  Pressure in head, constant next day after vaccination for a couple of days.   After the third day and onward, pressure onsets when I stand or while walking.  Pressure increases until dizzyness sets in, hearing diminishes, followed by pain in front of head. 2.  Pain and pressure in neck and down spine. 3.  Occasional sharp pain in head, as if a blood vessel is about to pop. 4.  After two 1/2 weeks, developed constant sensation of having a migraine headache. Visited doctor April 15th.   Prescribed Methylprednisolone, 4 mg.  Pain and pressure down spine reduced, but did not help other symptoms.   Visited doctor again April 27th.  Doctor gave me medication for Migraine headaches.  It is not helping so far. Doctor ordered MRI scan.   Appointment will be April 30, 2021

                                                4/30/21- Pt is a 56yo White male who presented to the Clinic for 1st Moderna vaccine via MyTurn registration. Patient answered No to all of the vaccination screening questions on MyTurn. At 1000, patient was checked in by staff. Immunization was administered approximately at 1002. Around 1007, the clinic providers were called for emergency response by CORE team member who was stationed at the observation area because this patient lost consciousness, fell down, and hit his head.  NP arrived to the scene with Emergency Epinephrine pen and benadryl tablets. RN was already at scene and assessed for patient&#39;s consciousness. EMS was called by Google volunteer. Patient was seated in the chair, being monitored by the clinic and CORE team member. Pt was unresponsive and actively undergoing tonic seizure-like activity with sustained posturing of bilateral hands in decorticate &#34;cup&#34; position. Patient&#39;s eyes were open during entire seizure-like activity, but unresponsive to stimuli. Inflamed abrasions were noted on patient&#39;s right temporal lobe, right cheek, and bilateral lower extremities near the knees. No active bleeding was seen.  At 1008, Pt regained consciousness after 10 seconds of seizure activity and began to answer RN&#39;s questions. Patient stated that he was &#34;fine&#34; and answered that he knew his current location &#34;at the vaccination site.&#34; Pt was unaware that he lost consciousness, fell to the ground, and hit his head. Pt denied any active medical illnesses, hx of seizures, or reactions to prior vaccinations. Pt stated that he drove here to the appointment. Patient was given bottle of water, which he started drinking. NP measured pt with pulse oximeter, reading 98% O2 Saturation and 61bpm for heart rate.  NP arrived to the scene. The medical staff RN, NP, and NP advised for patient to stay and wait for EMS out of concern for his own safety and the safety of others because he will be driving home. We informed pt that EMS has already been called and for him to stay hydrated while waiting. Pt stated &#34;I do not want to go to the hospital&#34; and refused EMS evaluation. I informed pt that due to sustained head injury, LOC, and seizure activity, we highly advise for patient to seek further medical evaluation. Pt refused and walked away from the observation area to his car.  Adverse Reaction was reported to VAERS and CMO of the clinic.

I told the  RN was having a reaction. I had brought my liquid benadryl in case I might have a reaction due to my severe food allergies. I immediately drank 50 mg of benadryl.  In 2 to 3 minutes my heart rate came down and I felt better. I was able to leave and drive home. I am an RN myself so I knew how to manage this situation.

I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

                                                Patient came to the emergency department on 02/02/2020 at 2:30 pm to be evaluated for possible stroke due to sudden acute numbness, weakness in right wrist and arm, but no pain. Patient has no prior history of sudden acute numbness in arm and did not report any recent injury to his arm. Neurologist evaluated patient for possible stroke and patient was unable to lift right wrist and hand. Patient was able to lift both arms overhead, lift both legs, smile normal, open and close mouth and move tongue.  Both CT Scan and MRI were normal. Neurologist and emergency medical specialist determined that patient did not have a stroke and diagnosed acute brachial plexus palsy possibly due to patient sleeping in an awkward position. Emergency specialist said it was unlikely but could not rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine, which patient had received 10 days earlier (second dose, see details above.)

Son took me to ER - Medical Center - and they put me on an IV and gave me Meclizine. Kept me for obsevation for 36 hours as it was not subsiding (the vertigo). Ruled out stroke with CT scan. They sent me home with Meclizine and I&#39;m still taking it. I get Vertigo every day still.

Patient was subsequently moved to a room and further evaluated including vital signs and 12 lead EKG. It was determined that patient is currently undergoing workup for possible cardiac issue, was recently started on Nitroglycerin yesterday and has a tentative angiogram scheduled Monday 3/1/21. After lying down during the evaluation patient&#39;s dizziness began to worsen. Talked with patient and spouse and recommended transport to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Around 5 pm patient got his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine,  and after 5 mins,he passed out while he was sitting in the observation area,his wife  was with him, once that incident had been noticed, I ran quickly to him but when I reached him he started to wake up again, I brought the emergency kit , a bottle of water, also I asked pharmacy tech to call  store manager to come over. I asked patient what happened and he stated that suddenly he felt dizzy and that he was anxious about the vaccine from the beginning and excited to get it at the same time, then I measured the blood pressure  it was 125/61 with pulse of 45/min.I offered him and his wife to call 911 but they declined it. I asked him to go back to my consultation area so he could lie down on the floor and raise his legs up so we can bring back the blood pressure up, he did that, and he went with me over there and laid down on the floor and we raised his legs up,later I measured his blood pressure again, and it was 113/71 with pulse 51/minute, I offered again to call 911 but he refused and he said that he was feeling better. I left him about 10 more minutes,then he started to get up and sit by the chair and I re-measured the blood pressure  and it was 121/76 with pulse of 54/minute, he started to drink water. He stated he felt better than he was about 20 minutes ago, then they left once their driver came to pick them up.

                                                Dizziness. Seems to be BPPV or very similar. Noticed this when getting out of bed the second morning after the shot. That was 3 days ago and am still experiencing same symptoms. Most noticeable when rolling over in bed but also when bending over with certain head movements.

Lightheadedness/dizziness, mild nausea, some intermittent jitteriness , periodic extreme fatigue. This has been going on every day for THREE WEEKS. Symptoms have faded some, but still persist. Will delay or cancel second shot.  If these effects are permanent, then I will have great difficulty doing my job.

By noon, I was feeling fatigued and started feeling confusion and lightheadedness. I had to leave work by 3:00pm. by 5:00pm, I was very concerned about the way I was feeling. The headache was severe and I was lethargic. I slept for most of the next 24 hours. 48 hours after the injection, I am still fairly lightheaded and have a headache, but I am improving.

The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation and had a pacemaker placed about 8-9 months ago.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event were blood pressure medication, antiarrhythmics.  On 01 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030m20a) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01 Mar 2021, after vaccination, the patient developed red dots on both of his arms. For next two days, the patient had rash on both arms, was dizzy, felt sick, developed fast heart rate; went to hospital twice for heart rate either 07 Mar 2021 or 13 Mar 2021.During first visit to hospital, fast rate was brought under control, while in the second visit, the patient had a procedure in which his heart was cut from top to bottom and was made pacemaker dependent. The atrial fibrillation could not be controlled for 26 hours and had a flutter which was not identified and could not be controlled. Flutter returned after stopping amlodipine and hence patient was restarted on amlodipine. The patient now feels very weak, has a hard time walking, has no energy, cannot do the simplest of tasks, still experiences fast heart rate and flutter every now and then.   No Laboratory investigations were provided. The Treatment information included pacemaker, amlodipine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cardiac pacemaker dependent, atrial fibrillation, red dots on both of his arms, rash on both arms, dizziness, sick, atrial flutter, very weak and no energy, hard time walking, cannot do the simplest of tasks were unknown.

After discussing with patient and patients spouse, agree that patient needs to be seen by either PCP, Dr. or go to ER. At the time pt did not wish to go to ER. Wife proceeded to call Dr.&#39;s office to see about getting him in. Pt then started to feel worse and like he needed to go to ER. offered to call for an ambulance, pt refused as his wife could take him and would probably be quicker. staff offered diphenhydramine and pt declined, stating he would wait until he got to ER for treatment. Pt appeared very anxious and nervous. transported him via wheelchair to his vehicle at 1620, his wife then drove him to ER. 04/09/2021 at 0828  I left a voicemail with pt for follow up.  0830 I called to get follow up on pt. I spoke with the nurse that treated the patient. Pt did indeed come to ER and was treated for a reaction. He was given a dose of benadryl and solumedrol. Pt verbalized feeling like he was having a severe anxiety attack and that his adrenaline was really high. Nurse stated that she agreed with him. Pt was later discharged that evening. No epinephrine use reported.

                                                Had usual flu symptoms before going to bed that were mild, BUT woke up around 4am with severe back ache on left side below rib cage and it hurt so much that I could barely walk.   At first, I thought it was some kind of a kink in my back, but after doing some research, I discovered that it was my spleen that got swollen and was pushing against rib cage on left side.  Symptoms continued to increase until about 9am and then began to slowly recede after this.  Today is 4/17/21 5:39pm and I still ache in this area, but it is very mild compared to symptoms I got on April 15th.

By the time  I had arrived at the house my head was pounding.   I was feeling  a dizzying  migraine.  I have not had one of those in a  while.  It was also accompanied with lite nausea.  I had a cup of coffee when I came home and went to bed.  I was feeling so bad I had to get up  and take a Sumatriptan and another cup of coffee.  I laid back down for a few more hours.  I awakened later,  used the restroom  and was feeling much better than before.   Although my arm and shoulder is sore at the injection site,  I?m feeling much better.

                                                Shortly after being vaccinated felt dizzy and developed a headache.  Headache got progressively worse throughout the day.   By that evening, headache evolved into a migraine and needed bed rest.  Also started to develop a fever.  About 99.5 deg.  Around that time, several hours after vaccination, heart began to race and had mild chest pains.  Chest pain subsided a couple of hours later.  Headache/ migraine persisted until the next day.  The following day, 24 hours after vaccination, headache subsided but I developed fever 101.5 deg. and chills.  This lasted about 24 hours.  All symptoms subsided after about 48 hours.

                                                Patient admitted with high grade AV block, sinus pause, and recurrent syncope. 57-year-old white male with PMH only of cigarette use who notes about 2 weeks of generalized malaise, then in the last 24 hours has had 2 syncopal episodes that were accompanied by diaphoresis only without other prodrome.  He got his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 5/28/21, then on the following day had been working in the barn without any dyspnea chest pain or shortness of breath but felt generally fatigued so went to take a nap.  He got up to check his temperature, then &#34;just hit the floor&#34;.  Not preceded by blackout of vision, lightheadedness, chest pain, dyspnea palpitations, nausea but was accompanied by sweats.  He believes he was out only briefly, and when he awoke was not confused and did not have tongue biting or loss of bladder or bowel continence.  He then got up and went about his day normally, then around 2 AM awoke to let the dogs out and had an identical event, but this time hit his chin on a chain saw on the floor and suffered a laceration. He presented to ED for evaluation where his laceration was sutured. He is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Initial labs and diagnostics are unrevealing and an EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm without acute or chronic ischemic changes.  Noncontrast CT of the head and the face showed no evidence of bony damage, no intracranial bleed or large territory infarct. While in the ED, the patient had a brief bradycardic episode accompanied by diaphoresis although a dedicated strip is not available and it is unclear what his rhythm was.  He did not syncopize.  Hospitalist service was asked to accept for syncope evaluation. When admitting physician saw patient, he reported feeling completely well without any other issues.  He does note he had about 2 weeks of malaise before all of this started and a mild decrease in his ability to work intensely, but had attributed this to cigarette smoking.  Review of systems was essentially negative.  He is a hobby farmer and has had a couple of tick bites this year. While admitting physician was in the room at the end of the visit, the patient had an episode of diaphoresis and went into a high-grade second-degree AV block with disappearance of atrial activity without ventricular escape and lost consciousness for about a second.  No jerking or twitching observed.  The episode a couple of seconds then self terminated and the patient awoke and completely recovered mentation and was in a sinus rhythm.  He was diaphoretic and felt ill afterward this.  He had no chest pain or dyspnea. Immediately after the episode with repeat vitals the patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 70s and a normal sinus rhythm and blood pressure is 136/80.  Oxygen saturations are preserved. Not on any rate limiting agents either here in emergency department or at home. Patient found to have P-P interval prolongation with AV block and subsequent sinus arrest possibly situational in the setting of coming off of a colonoscopy and receiving second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. A pacemaker was placed 6/1/2021 without complication and the patient was discharged in stable condition on 6/2/2021.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

I sat on the edge of the tub. After a couple of minutes I went to get up and fainted on the floor.  My BP was 89/49 with a pulse of 86bpm. I was helped off the floor and back to bed where I lay with my feet elevated by a couple of pillows. No further issues at this time.

I was shivering so bad that I was having muscle spasms so bad that I had difficulty walking on my right leg (hip replacement January 2020). After taking tylenol for fever my temp had gone down to 100. Headaches started soon after the fever and muscle spasms and it lasted well into the afternoon on the 9th along with feeling cold and clammy. At about 7:00 p.m. on the 9th, the fever started going back up so I took another dose of tylenol. The fever lasted until about 4:00 a.m. on the tenth. Currently, 10:00 a.m. on the tenth I feel somewhat normal, just really tired and having muscle pain in my upper back. All things considered, the whole ordeal felt like my time when I was getting better after going through covid in December.

                                                Per MD Clinical Note 3/14/21, &#34;Further discussion with his daughter today-patient has not been able to walk and has had unclear mentation for approximately 8 years after an alcohol related decline.  Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.   Assessment and plan Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia  One week post COVID-19 vaccination  Agitation  Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD, Wernicke    -continue to trend the LFTs downward.  Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

His pallor was very pale and he was sweating. When the pharmacist approached him to help, he was slumping over in the chair and in and out of coherence. He answered questions about his breathing and confirmed that he only felt light headed and breathing was not labored.  After removing his sweatshirt and mask to cool him off and allow better breathing and giving him some water, his skin color returned to normal and he was again speaking coherently.  His pulse and heart rate were a bit slow throughout. Ambulance was called and the patient refused to go to the hospital claiming he felt fine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA March 19: Received vaccine. Experienced only very minor muscle soreness in left arm.  March 20: In the evening, began to feel low level general muscle aches throughout body. March 23: Woke up with lower back muscles contracted. Very painful to move and stand up. Very difficult to walk. Could only walk very slowly and in a hunched over position. Changing positions from sitting to standing and vice versa was very painful and would take at least 7 or 8 minutes. Because of the extreme difficulty in movement and pain, went home to rest. Applied hot water bottle to lower back while lying down.  March 24: In the morning symptoms were better. Called the hospital but was told my symptoms were not a reaction to the Moderna vaccine.  March 25: Symptoms were greatly reduced. Able to walk nearly normal.

                                                Two days after his covid vaccine injection, he began to feel soreness in his left calf. He thought he was just experiencing a side effect from the vaccine. The soreness got worse and worse until about 2 weeks later when he had significant swelling and pain and could not not walk on the leg. He went to the hospital ED on 3/18 for care. He was admitted to  Hospital on that date for tests and blood thinners. He was discharged on 3/20 but was instructed to return by his PCP for continuing treatment with blood thinners (Eloquis) until she could see him  on Monday - they agreed to keep him in the ED and he was discharged home on Monday to see his PCP.

Patient contacted doctor&#39;s office and nurse said he needs to get better before taking the second dose. Some of these side effects he had before his shot because he has COPD already but he describes it as it is much worse now.

Oxygen usually 96 or 97 now it is 92 or 94. He describes really low energy level, nauseated throughout the day a lot, fatigue, feel sleepy a lot , so out of breath and started hyperventilated but it could be from panic attack he says. He still feels these symptoms to this day. He says it goes away when wife talks and rubs his back and when he lays still. BP is little low diastolic in 60s but normally 70s. yesterday 91/62. He says it could be due to synthroid discontinuation which he stopped taking one year ago but started back the morning of 4/21/21 to see if that is what is the cause.

                                                The evening of the vaccine, Wednesday, I was extremely tired.  By the next day, my right hip and right leg were throbbing.  I have not slept well since the vaccine.  By Friday, I was so sore that I visited a Chiropractor.  By Saturday, I could not stand, sit or lie down without extreme pain.  I called Dr. on his cell and he met us (my wife drove) at his clinic.  After treating me, he sent us to Urgent Care.  At the urgent care facility I received a Toradol shot and a prescription for prednisone.  Both Doctors said that this was a likely &#34;inflammatory response&#34; to the vaccine.  (continued below)

                                                Received my second shot on the late morning of yesterday (Thursday).  My arm was getting pretty sore by the time I went to bed (I could not sleep on my left side).  When I woke up, started feeling fuzzy and got the chills.  Took three 325 mg Acetaminophen in the morning.  Was running a low grade fever by lunch time (99.9 degrees) and was feeling like I had the flu.  Joints are sore, head still fuzzy, feel a little light headed when I move around too much.  Took three more 325 Acetaminophen after lunch.  No appetite, stomach feels queasy.  Tired but can&#39;t sleep.  Intend to take more acetaminophen this evening before bed.  Hopefully tomorrow my symptoms will start to go away.

                                                Same day as 1st vaccine shot I started getting nauseous after dinner. The next morning I woke up with dizziness, nausea, and muffled hearing in my left ear. The 2nd morning after the vaccine shot my left ear was almost completely muffled and the sounds I did hear were frequency distorted to the point I could not understand verbal speech from that ear. During the course of that day my right ear started getting muffled also. The night between the 2nd and 3rd day after the vaccine shot I woke up around 2 am with a severe case of vertigo while laying flat on my back in bed. I immediately felt hot all over and my entire body started sweating. I attempted to do an Epley maneuver with partial success. I eventually got up and took a Zertec-D and tried a second Epley maneuver on the floor in the living room. I was not able to go back to sleep and I made it through the day and the next night by taking another Zertec-D before bedtime.  The 4th day after the vaccine shot I did not take any medications and just stayed in bed or in a recliner all day. The night between the 4th and 5th day after the shot I again woke up around 3am with the worst vertigo ever and by 6am I told my wife I needed to go to the hospital. During the whole time the dizziness and nausea never abated. I was checked into Hospital on the morning of the 5th day after taking the vaccine shot and was transported to  in  for an MRI.

                                                I had extreme burning pain over a large area of my body.  Both arms, both legs, my chest, and head.  I had some word confusion and a sense of dislocation and a sense of doom.  I felt lightheaded and nauseous.  I have seen several doctors, and have had many tests, but no help for the pain

After 45 minutes the redness abated and I came home,    1 March 2021 I came down with COVID symptoms with dizziness, blurry vision, redness, ringing in the ear and flu like symptoms of body aches.   Then the neuralgia in the dextral ulnar nerve increased and clawing started.  Then same happened on the sinistral ulnar nerve and Carpal tunnel in the other finders.  I feared going to sleep for fear of awaking with paralysis.  I drank vodka to calm myself down and Xanax to sleep (I know it is a dangerous combination).  2 March the red skin continues and when I awoke at 13:30 today I was still extreme and I called 911.  The EMS visited and determined my blood pressure and pulse were normal.  The dextral  ulnar nerve problems continue,

                                                I began to experience lightheadedness, generalized weakness and confusion. My handwriting changed. These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.

At approximately 5:30 pm, my blood sugars rose in excess of 400 mg/dl, felt lightheaded followed by quick onset of high pressure and volume diarrhea. I was in my girlfriend&#39;s home and was barely able to get to the toilet in time. The diarrhea appeared pea soup green in color and consistency and very smelly.  Of interest, my girlfriend who also received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on the same date, time and location, was awaken at approximately 2:00 AM with the same rapid onset of diarrhea.  On the second day following the vaccine, we both had elevated temperatures of 101.5 and 102 lasting approximately 24 hours.

                                                The day of the shot, we noticed significant swelling in my neck on the right of center.  The swelling has maintained its size for now six weeks and one day.  I have a dull numbness in my 2-3 smaller toes of my left foot.  Sometimes I feel this numbness in my right foot, but not always.  My left arm and two smallest fingers also feel funny.  There is a dull pain in my left arm and dull numbness in my left smaller fingers.  The outside of my left leg also at times shares this numb feeling.  On the day I got the shot I immediately felt like I had a dose of caffeine, though that feeling passed after a couple of hours.  It did not feel significant enough to keep me from driving or leaving the facility, but it was noticeable. I experienced diarrhea for about a week and a half. For the first week after the shot I alternated nights of not being able to stay still sleeping, keeping me awake almost the entire night, 3 of the first 6 nights.  I visited my family doctor within one week of the first shot.  He advised me not to get the second shot and made note of the swelling in my neck. I visited him at five weeks because the swelling in my neck and numb feeling has not changed.  He scheduled a CT Scan which has been scheduled.

Pain dissipated completely at about 46 hour mark after the injection.  Also, felt fatigued and as if I had a mild flu. Those symptoms dissipated a bit sooner, and were gone after about 41 hours.

April 8, 2021, 5:40 am: I took my sinus medicine hoping the headache would subside. April 8, 2021, 5:50 am: Typing this so I don?t forget how I felt the first nights after the shot. April 8, 2021, 6:15 am: Drank a cup of coffee. April 8, 2021, 6:45 am: Chills went away, and headache subdued some. Still have a headache though. April 8, 2021, 7:45 am: Went back to bed to rest. Slept on and off the rest of the day with fatigue, sore body, and headache. Let up around 8pm. April 9, 2021, 7:00 am: Got up feeling much better today.

Within a minute of this event and getting to the patient he was already conscious although lethargic and kept closing his eyes. Over the next 5-10 minutes he became much more responsive and eventually stood up and had a seat in a chair. EMS was already called and came to check on him and eventually they let him go and he indicated he was fine and continued to finish his shopping.

These symptoms lasted about a week.   He brought this up later after the side effects had resolved.  He also reported a transient amnesia episode where he forgot where he was driving locally and had to have some one come pick him up 2 weeks after the 2nd vaccine.  Both of these side effects occurred after the second vaccine.
