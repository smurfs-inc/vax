                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

My head started to pound and my pulse was accelerated to probably 80 bpm (normally rest at 60 bpm). I felt a little lightheaded and  a bit nauseas. I took 2 200 mg tablets of EC ibuprofen and did not take Tylenol because i knew my immune response needed to take its course. it is about 3:33 in the afternoon and my body is still aching but my fever has dissipated and I still have a headache that throbs when I walk.

                                                Approximately, 25 minutes after vaccine administration the patient verbalized feeling dizzy. He was transferred from a chair to a nearby cot with feet elevated. The ER was notified and an EpiPen was on standby. Vital signs were: BP 155/69, O2 saturation 100%, and HR 125. Vitals were rechecked 5 min later and HR came down to 76. Dizziness still persisted and he complained of his hands feeling weak but grip strength was noted to be equal bilaterally. There was no indication for EpiPen so it was not used. Patient preference was to be transported to the ER for additional follow-up. In the ER vital signs continued to be monitored and patient was given 1 liter sodium chloride 0.9% fluid bolus after which the patient reported feeling much better. Patient was discharged from the ER.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection at 6 pm I began to experience right sided ankle pain and swelling and mild chills. The pain peaked about 2 hours later about a 5/10 and was constant. I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen and elevated my foot. The right ankle was visibly swollen and red compared to the left.  Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

The patient&#39;s medical history included aphasia. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included diazepam, duwalpro and another, unspecified over-the-counter product.  On 15-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   That same day, according to report, the patient seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down were not working.  On 16-FEB-2021, the patient was unable to walk and could only crawl; he was just dragging his feet. He was also getting tired very quickly.     Treatment for the event included paracetamol and ibuprofen.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.    The outcome of the events, seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down, he could no longer walk and could only crawl,  just drags his feet and was also getting tired very quickly, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association, a causal association between the reported events and the administration of the mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                Approximately two hours after injection, slight discomfort and soreness about 2 inches in radius below the the injection site, but not at the point of contact. Movement of the upper arm produced some levels of pain, but nothing noteworthy. It was uncomfortable to sleep on, though, so that was avoided. Lower arm unaffected.  The following morning,  the pain was immediately noticeable and made using the arm a severely difficult task. It was painful to move the forearm above stomach level, and essentially impossible to do any sort of heavy lifting with it. Pain relieving medication such as aspirin and ibuprofen helped in a minimal capacity, and was ultimately irrelevant in the healing process. These symptoms lasted the entirety of the day after the injection and most of the following day as well, subsiding mostly in the evening. Today (Thursday, third full day after), all pain and soreness/dullness are entirely gone. The second full day was easily the most intense in terms of pain.

                                                Patient was given a covid vaccine on 3/4/21 at approximately 5:40pm.  The administration went well according to the patient.  After approximately 10 minutes, while the patient was sitting in the post vaccination area, he appeared to be pale looking to the imx RPh.  The pharmacist asked him how he was doing, he replied &#34;I am doing so-so&#34;.  The RPh got up to check on him further when the patient fell to the floor.  The RPh rolled him on his back, got him in a comfortable position,  and elevated his legs.  RPh applied gauze to a cut in his lip, and with the immediate assistance of the health screener, applied cold compress to his neck and forehead.  Patient experienced faintness and sweaty skin only.  Patient did not show any other symptoms.  After about15 minutes, patient said he felt like himself again, and wanted to sit up in a chair.  The RPh assisted him into a chair, where he sat for 5 minutes.  At the request of the patient, he wanted to go home.  RPh escorted patient to his car and watched him get inside safely.  1 hour later, RPh followed up with a phone call to the patient and he was on his way to an urgent care clinic to get a possible stitch for his lip.

The following night, 3/4/2021, muscle pain in upper back started to develop. The morning of 3/5/2021 the muscle pain had spread from upper back to neck and shoulders. The pain was severe enough to impede the ability to get dressed or drive.  I took Ibuprofen and noticed little relief, then took 1g of acetaminophen and experienced some relief. Pain persisted at same degree until the evening of  3/7/2021  where pain had started to noticeably subside. On morning of 3/8/2021,  armpit discomfort had ceased and muscle pain and been reduced to that of very slight soreness.  as on 3/10/2021 all pain had disappeared.

The condition has not improved, and it is now 39 hours after injection. Regular, everyday tasks are very difficult. Pain is about a 7.5/10.  Also, 24 hrs after injection I experienced a fever. The fever lasted for 12 hours without coming below 103 degrees, and went up to 105.2 degrees at its highest. This was accompanied by extreme chills. I have also have body aches, which are likely a result of the fever, and the fact that I haven&#39;t slept in 2 nights because of these side effects.

                                                We had a patient who got Covid-19 vaccine on 03/23/2021 at 11:32 and was feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  Patient reported to pharmacist while he was sitting on chair. So, I advise him to lay down on the floor with elevated feet. I also provide cold compress to the patient. I checked his blood pressure, and it was within normal range (124/76, 126/78) with the pulse rate was 60. Patient reported that he did not eat anything since morning, so he thinks his lightheadedness is due to low blood sugar. I gave him water after he set down back on the chair to make sure that he is hydrated well enough. We observed him for total of 45 minutes to make sure he was feeling fine before he left the pharmacy area. Patient called family member to pick him up.

Treatment: Took the day after the shot off of work and slept a LOT (approx 18 hours on and off), stayed hydrated and fed. Did not take painkillers due to hearing it would interfere with vaccine uptake. Most symptoms except for headache had gone away by 30-hour mark. Only some lingering fatigue and achiness left over past 36-hour mark.

The next day I woke up drenched in sweat and with the chills and a fever of 101.5, I think. And then the joint pain started. Especially in my knees. I applied icee hot and drank some pepto. And only ate a few crackers to have something in my body, tried to drink a lot of electrolytes. By Sunday night I woke up every hour from joint pain, especially my knees and lower back. I woke up in the middle of the night shivering and unable to get warm. I took a warm shower, and had to sit on the ground and just let the warm water run. My knees were in so much pain I couldn?t stand. Monday morning I woke up with a fever of 100 but tolerable joint and stomach pain. By Monday afternoon my fever had gone down, but still has abdominal pain, headache and mild joint pain.  I Was able to eat dinner chicken soup.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

                                                Moderna vaccine dose #1 received in right shoulder on 12/31/20 at 2:15PM. Injection was uneventful other than sensation of pressure. I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head. I am concerned with the possibility of long term and/or permanent damage after reviewing the literature. I am also concerned about how many other healthcare workers the person who gave me my vaccine may be injuring and/or causing permanent harm to.

                                                Asthma Reaction; Dizzy; Lighted headed; Difficulty breathing; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who is a 29-year-old male patient that received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced dizziness, light headed, asthma reaction (asthmatic crisis) and difficulty breathing.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included pantoprazole 40 mg.  On 28-Dec-2020, approximately three hours prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28-Dec-2020, the patient developed dizziness, became light headed, experienced an asthmatic reaction and difficulty breathing. The events were treated with a dose of albuterol. The patient was transported to the Emergency Room but additional information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, dizziness, light headed, asthma reaction and difficulty breathing was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                About 5 to 10 minutes after the shot I felt extremely lightheaded and then fainted.  When I came to about 10 seconds later, there was a public health official there rubbing my chest asking me if I knew where I was.  It took me a second to fully come to my senses but then I realized where I was and what had happened.  I was very pale, felt chills, was sweating, and it took effort to open my hands.  The EMTs ran a bunch of tests, my Blood pressure was low (I think the number I remember was 104/33), but the rest of the measurements like blood sugar or the number of ekg like tests they did all came back normal.  The EMTs in the field said they think it was a response to the vaccine.  After about 20 minutes of the EMTs monitoring me, my numbers came back up and I was feeling relatively normal.  I waited another 30 minutes before leaving just to make sure.  It has been almost a week and I haven&#39;t felt any symptoms close to that since then.

Patient was given a cold cloth around the back of his neck and his blood pressure was taken and it was 82/58.  Patients O2 sat was 98 and pulse was 78. Patient stated that he was allergic to nuts. We asked if he had eaten breakfast this morning and he stated that he had a bowl of cereal. I instructed for someone to have him sit on the ground and to get him some candy  and a sugary drink.  A package of skittles was presented along with a Mountain Dew.  After finishing both the candy and Mountain Dew  (aprox 4 mins) the patient started to get a little color back and he stated he was feeling much better.  A second set of vitals was then taken which were  BP: 106/78 the O2 sat 98 and Heart rate was again at 78.  We instructed the patient to please hang around for 30 more minutes and after that time left with the person he was with.

                                                This patient felt fine with the injection and for the 15 min following. He was dismissed to check out and make a follow up appt. While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day. Instructed him to make sure he is well hydrated before he comes for his second dose vaccination.

He drove himself back to vaccination clinic parking lot at approximately 1:40pm and got out of his car hurriedly to get his mask from the trunk before speaking with EMS on site. He then reported to EMS his wife witnessed him have a seizure (eyes rolled back, unresponsive, stiffening of arms and legs) for 2-3 min approximately 1 hour after receiving his shot. He reported when he regained responsiveness he asked his wife what had happened as he reportedly had no recollection of the seizure, they decided to call the patient&#39;s sister and she directed them to return to site of vaccination to report his seizure.  EMS who evaluated patient reported he denied (and was not exhibiting) postictal signs/symptoms when he arrived back in parking lot at vaccination site. He denied having a history of seizures or any medical conditions. EMS also reported that neither the patient nor his wife called 911 after the seizure. Patient declined any further medical evaluation/follow up. EMS urged him to call 911 if he had anymore seizure activity to which he replied he thought if he just rested Friday and through the weekend, he&#39;d be fine to return to work on Monday.

                                                Around 11:15 am, Jan 17, 2021, while standing at the toilet, my son either lost his balance or fainted and fell to the floor.  He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

                                                On the night of the 20th, I experienced a mild headache and minor left arm soreness. I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

He was dazed and said he just felt off. When he stood up, he fell down and felt very dizzy.  We were doing a vaccine clinic at his place of employment that day so I was still on site and he came back into the room I was stationed around 1:30pm. He said he felt ok, was talking, breathing fine, just felt a little &#34;off.&#34; He had white spots all over his left arm and some on his right.   None were raised, red, or itchy. His left hand was red/purple in color. I gave 50mg of diphenhydramine and he stated about 10 minutes later he felt better.  I observed him for approximately another hour. He was walking around, talking fine and stated he felt normal when he left. He still had some slight discoloration on his left arm.

                                                During the 15 minute observation period after injection, patient returned to the check-in desk complaining of dizziness. He was brought immediately to exam room where he became pale, diaphoretic, and stated he &#34;felt like he was in a dream.&#34; Seated BP was 74/palp. He was placed in supine position on exam table, cool compresses placed on forehead and back of neck. He complained of some nausea, which quickly improved. He never lost consciousness. His color and alertness improved steadily over the next 10 minutes. Repeat BP (lying) was 100/50. After a few minutes he sat up on exam table, dangling legs. BP remained stable at 110/60, HR 84. He continued to improve and stated that he felt better, drank some water and ate some goldfish crackers. Reported that he just remembered he had not eaten since lunch. After another 5-10 minutes he was alert, oriented, able to walk unassisted. Final BP 114/70, HR 80. His wife remained with him and confirmed she could drive him home. Discussed that although I feel confident this was a vasovagal near-syncope, if symptoms recur or worsen, he should go to ER for evaluation. Understanding verbalized.

He attempted to get up and and fell to the floor. He was awake, alert and spoke intelligently while EMT team was being expected. After about 10 minutes he sat up on the floor and was doing just fine. He stated that he believed his reaction to the vaccine was because he had not eaten prior to getting it. The EMT arrived after about 25 minutes from when incident started, took his blood pressure and measured his sugar levels and both were fine. Patient declined an emergency room offer from the EMT, ate a chesse burger meal and left the store. Pharmacy has followed with 3 phone calls, but patient is yet to respond.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

Over the next few days, it grew until it completely covered from the middle of my upper arm to my elbow. Sunday, March 28th, the redness and swelling is fading finally but still noticeable. Also the 3 nights following my shot, I dealt with severe lightheadedness and dizziness, but only at night

In the recovery/observation area, he became pale and lightheaded.  His companion asked for help from EMTs stationed in the room.  After I spoke with the patient and at my suggestion, the EMTs helped the patient onto a gurney so he could recline and recover.  The patient was fine after 15 minutes, declined further care, and walked out of the room in the company of his companion.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was fine until after a few minutes.  He started to say he felt lightheaded.  He placed is head between his knees, he started to sweat and I gave him some water at his request.  He sat back and started to get pale and more sweaty, he complained about pain in his arm and neck.  He then began to slightly shake and passed out.  He was awoken very quickly by his wife who was standing in front of him.  We kept talking to him and I checked his pulse and called 911.  After about 30 minutes he was feeling much better and did not need to go to the hospital.  His vitals were strong and he walked out on his own.  I contacted him 3 hours later and he was resting but feeling fine.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was asked to move to observation area.  Shortly after sitting down the patient came back to pharmacy counter and stated he was feeling dizzy.  Just as the pharmacist was telling him to sit back down he fainted and fell on the floor.  He recovered rather quickly (matter of seconds?) and tried to sit up right away.  Pharmacist asked him to stay on the floor for a moment, the store&#39;s first responder (MIC) was called over to pharmacy.  After a minute of sitting on floor the patient got up on his own accord and transferred to a nearby chair.  His BP was taken twice per emergency protocol of pharmacy.  Patient initially appeared calmmy and BP  was 132/81, pulse 44, respirations 18 at 12:25p.   BP was 142/89, pulse 48, respirations 16 at 12:35.  Patient was given both a water and a Gatorade while he was seated.  Patient stated he had not eaten anything yet for the day.  Patient was repeatedly offered medical services (i.e. &#34;Do you want a medic? Do we need to call an ambulance?&#34;) The patient repeatedly refused any further medical treatment.  After further observation patient was able to stand, check out at the pharmacy and left the store on his own accord.

                                                The following day I became increasingly fatigued, roughly 30 hours later I took a 2 hour nap. I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

While sitting down his eye rolled back and he passed out.  His spouse said his body was shaking.  She lowered him to the floor and he awoke.  Paramedics were called and determined his blood pressure was very low. They tried to stand the patient up to take another blood pressure reading, but the patient had to sit down as he became dizzy and lightheaded again.  The paramedics took him to the ER where the doctor said he was fine and discharged him.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

                                                On the day of vaccination my arm was sore but at night i had a fever, chills, muscle aches and headache associated with insomnia. Symptoms started to get worse the next day of vaccination as I was hardly moving my left arm and i had to get off work early because i couldn&#39;t stand on my feet for a long time. finally on the third day symptoms started to improve.

Standing for more than a couple of minutes caused lightheaded feeling.   A high fever started around 5 pm that night and lasted until midnight when it seemed to break while I was sleeping after taking Tylenol.  The next day mild headache remained but was much better overall other symptoms did not remain.

                                                I recieved my second covid 19 vaccine by moderna.  I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

Chills, dizziness, and body aches continued mildly through Sunday.   I also passed out/blacked out the night of getting the vaccine while using the bathroom. Unclear if this was simply due to standing too quickly while experiencing the above mentioned symptoms and blood rushing to my head or a true side effect of the vaccine.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

Within seconds I was unresponsive for what appears to have been just over 1 minute. My wife called 911 and I was starting to come to while she was wrapping up the call with the dispatcher. I remained seated upright, did not fall over, but was completely unresponsive.  When the EMT&#39;s checked vitals (within 5 minutes of me coming back to awareness), all was normal. Simply a full body cold sweat. It&#39;s now 10pm and I feel no other symptoms. Completely &#34;normal&#34;.

I asked my pharmacy staff to call 911 and attend the patient.  I was attending a patient who was feeling faint after her vaccination.  Staff was in contact with 911 and were attending patient.   His initial blood pressure reading was 138/92. He was sweating profusely.  He was no longer talking.  his next blood pressure reading was higher in the 160&#39;s according to our other pharmacist who was attending him.  The paramedics were here very quickly and took the patient to a local hospital.  I believe the attending pharmacist will also be reporting this.

He went to the waiting room and all of a sudden he told his wife he thought he was going to faint. He did and she got on his lap immediately so he wouldn&#39;t fall. She was tapping his face and talking to him. Others in the waiting room were helping. He punched his wife in the stomach (she is pregnant) but she seemed to be ok as she was trying to get him back to normal. I called 911 and  manager gave him water and ice. The paramedics came and checked him out to make sure he was ok. He was very alert by the time they got here and then they left. He continued to sit for awhile and I asked if his wife would be driving. She said yes. I told him if they needed anything to call us.d

I?m not sure if these individuals have reported this but I have provided a forum where people are reporting this same issue.    The vertigo was so intense on Monday 3/8/2021 at around 4:30am that I ended up getting sick and throwing up.  Symptoms are still around today 3/10/2021 but not as severe.

It feels like I slept funny and have a bad kink in my neck. I am also feeling a little light headed and slightly nauseous. I ate some oatmeal for breakfast and took 1000mg of Acetaminophen and it has not helped. Its been almost 2 hours since I took the tylenol with no result.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

I can open my mouth just enough to eat, which I believe is also contributing to the earache. patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath or hives. patient denies any other signs or symptoms. Patient plans to wait until Thursday February 4, 2021 and if symptoms haven&#39;t improved will consult his primary care provider. Patient notified if new or worsening symptoms develop to be seen right away for evaluation.

                                                At about 10 minutes post injection I began feeling dizzy, lightheaded and hot. Left arm began itching. Discovered hives on my upper arm. 15 minutes later hives had spread to my left shoulder and neck. Paramedics on site gave me a fimotadine tablet and a benedryl injection, juice, water and monitored me. 20 minutes later there was no improvement, they gave another benedryl injection. Dizziness persisted. Hives began to resolve. 40 minutes later they permitted me to leave but said I could not drive, because the dizziness persisted. Advised me to take a benedryl tablet by mouth before bed and again in the morning and to follow up with my PCP.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

                                                Patient developed sudden onset vertigo with recurrent vomiting. He was brought to the emergency department and was evaluated under the stroke protocol and underwent CT, CTA, and MRI of the brain which did not reveal an etiology of his symptoms. He had a neurology consultation and the most likely cause was thought to be vestibular neuritis on the left side. He was treated with Zofran, Reglan, Meclizine, IV fluids, and Valium with partial relief and was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Symptoms are unresolved at the time of this report.

Had been sitting at computer for at least six hours straight (and probably smoking more pot than I should have), felt dizzy and short of breath, got up, ended up losing consciousness on the living room floor. Woke up a few minutes later and put myself to bed; felt fatigue, aches, chills, and like I might have been running a mild fever. Slept unusually well; woke up this morning feeling perfectly fine. Not particularly concerned but felt like I should report it.

                                                Woke up on Friday morning (3/5) with severe neck pain and vertigo. Tried to walk to bathroom and was falling over to the right side and felt very nauseous. Starting throwing up. Arrived at ER around9:30AM and was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged a few hours later. He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

                                                Sinus pressure started the same night as the vaccine. The symptoms gradually worsened throughout the night. He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

Within 3 days I started having pins and needle sensation in my right arm, from my shoulder to my finger, mainly my pinky and ring finger. I progressed to my left arm and right leg.  I&#39;ve had back pain since then but not sure if it&#39;s related. The pins an needles I feel every now and then but not as bad. The light headedness has not gone away, I can&#39;t shake it.  I&#39;ve seen my Dr, he put me on an anxiety medication.  My blood work came out good. I started the anxiety meds and started seeing a Therapist , but I don&#39;t really see a difference, it&#39;s nice to see someone but not getting better. I&#39;m coming off the anxiety med because a side effect is light headedness and that&#39;s not helping me much.  I have not got the second dose and do not plan on getting it.

                                                After 24 hours right arm was sore, swollen with large amount of redness around injection area, could not raise it above the shoulder. Entire body was weak and fatigued.  48 hours everything seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.  Roughly 80 hours later from the vaccination, suddenly body cramped up and had trouble speaking and pronouncing words. Fell to the ground and had hand spasms similar to bells palsy or cerebral palsy. Could not speak fluently or get up on my own. After 45 minutes to 1 hour, when paramedics were called and came they sat me up. Within a few minutes, like a switch, I could speak normally again and could walk on my own. Walked out to the ambulance and waited for 15 minutes or so, and everything seemed fine and back to &#39;normal&#39;. Declined to go to hospital, and since that episode things are still &#39;normal&#39;.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

At this time, I also had profuse cold sweats, my limbs started getting cold, I could not see or hear and had ?stars? like I was about to pass out.  My wife helped me downstairs and after some water and Tylenol, symptoms reversed themselves in about 15 minutes.  My body temperature was not recognized by the thermometer and then registered 93.4

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA Approximately 3 hours after vaccine, shoulder pain began to develop. Pain became significant, waking me in the middle of the night. The following day, I was unable to lift the arm I received the injection in no higher than about 80 degrees from my side. Pain increased despite taking OTC NSAIDS. By the second morning after vaccine administration, pain had worsened and right arm cannot be raised more than about 60 degrees without significant pain. Contacted PCP office about 12 hours after injection, they recommended NSAID dosages alternating ibuprofen and tylenol, and icing the shoulder. Pain impacts daily life activities, including caring for small children , lifting items that weigh more than a few pounds by the impacted arm, and significant difficulty reaching any object above the level of the shoulder. I have never previously experienced this kind of reaction to any other upper arm injection or vaccination.

                                                After the 15 minute waiting period, I was released. While driving home, I experienced swelling in my throat. This persisted and worsened until 5 pm. At 5 pm I had fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain, as well as dizziness. By 5:30 my condition worsened, and I have a fast heartbeat, significant dizziness, and chills. At 5:40 I contacted my wife to leave work to drive me to the hospital. We arrived at the hospital around 6:15; by 8 pm most symptoms except dizziness had disappeared. By 9 pm the dizziness had abated. It is 10:40 pm and I am still a little dizzy, but able to move and operate fine.

Pharmacist asked for other possible reactions: tingling, itchy skin, rash, difficulty swallowing or swelling of lips. Patient denied all those reactions  stating that he only felt &#34;a little dizzy.&#34; He decided that he would sit for 10-15 more minutes to &#34;wait it out.&#34; Patient was given water to sip while seated for the extra time. After about 10 minutes he was able to walk without feeling dizzy and reported to the pharmacist that he was well. Pharmacist advised him to log onto the V-Safe site to report his reactions and to review the Moderna EUA.

                                                patient received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. After receiving in our immunization room, he left the room and then shortly walked over to the pharmacy in-window and told the pharmacy tech that he did not feel well and felt dizzy. Tech had him go sit down in the waiting room and went and got the nurse, who went out to check on patient. Patient was slumped in the waiting room chair with eyes closed and very sweaty. Patient said he wanted water, so staff quickly got him water. After a few sips, patient&#39;s head rolled back and he lost consciousness for roughly 10 seconds before waking up startled and confused. Ambulance was already called and when the arrived they triaged the patient for around 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes the patient seemed much better and the paramedics decided it was OK for him to leave and drive himself home.

                                                Patient had dark circles under their eyes and did discuss at the drop off window they had a needle phobia. Immediately after the immunization, he said he felt lightheaded. I, pharmacist, sat in the booth and talked to him for a couple minutes then asked if he felt he could finish his observation outside the booth.  I notified technician to hand him off to her for observation , sharing by observation that the patient did not look well but he said he was doing a little better. He said he felt better and he did wait in the chairs outside the immunization booth. While I was in the pharmacy discussing this information with my pharmacy technician when I heard yelling and I stepped back out of the pharmacy to observe the patient was sliding out of his chair, stiff straight. My other technician came to my assistance and we both tried to get him to the floor and he was making incoherent noises and his arm was bent behind him and not relaxing to where we could get him to the floor. He then came to and startled a bit, with a bewildered look on his face. He asked what happened and said he felt he was dreaming.  A witness waiting on her prescriptions for pickup said that it originally appeared he was having a seizure which was my concern as well. We called code white and 911 and store manager assisted us at the scene. Patient denied the ambulance.

The right side of my bottom lip started tingling about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I had no swelling or other impairment at the time and was released after 40 minutes of observation. A little later the entire right side of my face felt as if it had fallen asleep, approximately 1 hour later and it worsened until about 4 hours later. By the next day the nausea and lightheadedness was gone, and the tingling/numbness to the right side of my face was gone within 48 hours, improving after 24 hours.

                                                Nausea, lightheadedness, and finally numbness to right side of face, slight drooping on right corner of mouth and right side of bottom lip. It began with a tingling feeling in lip. Observing staff did not notice any swelling, or other impairments, asked me if I had anxiety, and sent me on my way. Shortly after, it felt as if I had gotten a shot at the dentist, and had the tingling numbness left over on the right side of my face. About 4 hours later, my bottom lip and right side of my mouth drooped slightly, but I could still smile, talk, raise my arm, so there was no other impairment. By the next day the numbness had mostly subsided, and the nausea and lightheadedness was gone. This vaccine was given to me at a work clinic in the administration building. I do not have contact information for them but was provided a packet with this website. I don&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions, do not have anxiety, am not a hypochondriac, did not even know about the Bell&#39;s Palsy issues in trials until after I felt numbness, and the right side of my face felt as if it fell asleep, like a foot falling asleep but it was my face. It was not to the extent of Bell&#39;s palsy, and may have even been my bottom lip swelling slightly on the right side that caused the droop. It infuriates me that this side effect was dismissed as me having anxiety because I was nervous that my face was going numb which would be a natural reaction for anyone.

                                                Lower Back Spasms just a few hours after vacine was administered.  I went to bed with what I thought was just flu like syptoms like achy muscles.  But this was more then that.  Even laying in bed my back would spasm and almost take my breath away.  That night did not sleep due to the sporadic unpredictable pain when laying in bed.  Describe pain as electic shock or stabbing pain that takes your breath away it&#39;s so intense, but then goes away very quickly.  The next couple of days I was forced to stay immobile due to the pain that was sporadic in nature.  Even when laying down it spasmed.   I could barely walk for a few days.  I started taking NSAIDS to help with the pain and I became more mobile after a few days.  Work has been very difficult and spasms have not gone away even now Im still having problems and am struggling making it through the work day.  I have to lay down flat on my back as soon as I get home from work and take ibuprofen to relieve the pain.  I was absolutely fine healthy and very active person prior to the vaccine.  Just hours after getting vaccine it&#39;s almost like my joints and back were inflamed for some reason.

                                                I had a MVA on December 19 2000. After physical therapy the pain in my neck was down to a 1. Then after the 2nd dose of moderna about 15 hours after injection I woke up Sunday morning (the next day) and I could barely get out of bed from the pain in my neck. I could not move my neck and the pain was radiating down my left arm. The next day (Monday) I was feeling better and had more movement in my neck but still lots of pain. I went to the PA on Monday and got checked out. I still had strength but mobility was very little. I still have the pain and radiation down arm.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 26-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 26-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle) (seriousness criterion medically significant), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement). At the time of the report, SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) was resolving.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications taken by the patient were not provided.  The reporter reported that patient never had any allergic reactions to vaccines or medications before and had no past medical histories for vasovagal reactions. After receiving the vaccine, the patient waited in the pharmacy for 15 minutes - 20 minutes. The patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement. The patient was out of it for 15-30 seconds. The reporter stated that she called 911. The patient came to, his eyes were huge, but he was aware to self and surroundings. The emergency team came, took the patient&#39;s vitals which were stable and stated the patient likely experienced a vasovagal effect from the needle. However, the reporter thinks it was a potential seizure; more than a vasovagal response. Emergency team offered no treatment. The emergency team had encouraged the patient to follow up with a doctor but the patient did not want to make a big scene.  Emergency team offered no treatment for the patient.

Per patient, immediately after being injected he had severe shoulder pain and since receiving the vaccine he has been unable to use his arm. His arm has been in a sling and he is being denied further medical evaluation. The Nurse who was present suggested he contact his family adding that the doctor injected too high.  He had the second vaccine with no adverse reaction.
