                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

My head started to pound and my pulse was accelerated to probably 80 bpm (normally rest at 60 bpm). I felt a little lightheaded and  a bit nauseas. I took 2 200 mg tablets of EC ibuprofen and did not take Tylenol because i knew my immune response needed to take its course. it is about 3:33 in the afternoon and my body is still aching but my fever has dissipated and I still have a headache that throbs when I walk.

                                                Approximately, 25 minutes after vaccine administration the patient verbalized feeling dizzy. He was transferred from a chair to a nearby cot with feet elevated. The ER was notified and an EpiPen was on standby. Vital signs were: BP 155/69, O2 saturation 100%, and HR 125. Vitals were rechecked 5 min later and HR came down to 76. Dizziness still persisted and he complained of his hands feeling weak but grip strength was noted to be equal bilaterally. There was no indication for EpiPen so it was not used. Patient preference was to be transported to the ER for additional follow-up. In the ER vital signs continued to be monitored and patient was given 1 liter sodium chloride 0.9% fluid bolus after which the patient reported feeling much better. Patient was discharged from the ER.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection at 6 pm I began to experience right sided ankle pain and swelling and mild chills. The pain peaked about 2 hours later about a 5/10 and was constant. I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen and elevated my foot. The right ankle was visibly swollen and red compared to the left.  Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

The patient&#39;s medical history included aphasia. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included diazepam, duwalpro and another, unspecified over-the-counter product.  On 15-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   That same day, according to report, the patient seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down were not working.  On 16-FEB-2021, the patient was unable to walk and could only crawl; he was just dragging his feet. He was also getting tired very quickly.     Treatment for the event included paracetamol and ibuprofen.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.    The outcome of the events, seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down, he could no longer walk and could only crawl,  just drags his feet and was also getting tired very quickly, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association, a causal association between the reported events and the administration of the mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                I received the shot and was told to sit in a chair and wait for 15 minutes. After about 5-10 minutes I began to feel faint/lightheaded/clammy. I do have a history of these from shots I have had in the past. I got the pharmacists attention and told her I was feeling faint and asked for some water. Once she left, breathing in my throat felt significantly constricted. I had a reaction to clear my throat a few times but that didn&#39;t not affect anything. The pharmacist came back with water and an ice pack that she held against my neck. During this episode I was able to drink water still. The severity of the breathing issue leveled off and eventually I was able to breathe normally again. The whole thing lasted 1-2 minutes. It felt longer thinking back on it but I don&#39;t think it lasted as long as my impression of the episode.  After that I felt tingling followed by shakiness in my extremities which was more typical of the fainting side effects ive had in the past. I&#39;ve never experienced breathing issues with other shots I&#39;ve received in the past. The pharmacist kept me there to monitor me for 30-45 minutes. No additional medication was administered

                                                Written by Doctor: April 7, 2021 2:09 p.m. DOB 2/07/1995, male, received his second dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot 019B21A) at 1:13 p.m.  He stood up and walked to the usher?s table to have his vaccine card completed.  Approximately one minute after receiving his vaccine, he had a syncopal episode falling directly backwards striking his head on the floor.  I, MD did not directly witness the fall, but everyone who witnessed the fall said that he fell completely unimpeded to the floor.  I was notified and immediately assisted the patient who was with his girlfriend.  Patient initially appeared ?out?, but almost immediately opened his eyes and asked what happened.  His skin was cool and clammy.  A pulse oximeter was placed on his finger registering 98% o2 and a pulse of 53.  I kept him lying on the floor until he was completely awake and aware of his surroundings.  At the time he said his neck was not sore, but his head was sore.  Approximately 2-3 minutes later, we were able to assist him in standing to immediately sit down in a wheelchair.  He was taken to the cot in the hallway just outside the Medical Observation where I was able to help him to stand and then lie down.  An icepack was provided to put on the back of his head, he was provided water, Gatorade, and two cookies.  Patient said that he hadn?t eaten all day and had been feeling slightly hungry prior to his vaccination.  I had patient move all extremities and asked his questions to verify that he was full awake and oriented to person, place, and time.  Patient girlfriend  stayed with patient while he ate his cookies.  I addressed my concerns about patient striking his head on the floor and the possibility of a closed head injury.  Girlfriend felt that patient was now completely back to his normal state of mind.  I had patient remain lying down for 20 minutes.  When I returned to check on him, he was sitting up and wanted to leave.  I told him that he needed to be able to walk up and down the hallway before I would feel comfortable letting him leave.  He stood up and walked halfway down the hallway before saying he was lightheaded.  I immediately went to him to lead him back to the cot, but he insisted that he needed to use the bathroom to urinate.  Both girlfriend and I stood in the doorway to assist patient if he needed, but he was able to finish urinating, then returned and sat in the wheelchair.  I spoke to both Doctors via a phone call and had spoken to someone earlier.  After letting them know that patient did not want an ambulance called, but I was going to strongly recommend he go to the nearest ER before returning home, I returned to the patient.  Vital signs at 1:53 were Pulse Ox of 98%, pulse 78, and blood pressure sitting of 140/75.  Again, I strongly recommended that girlfriend drive him to an ED for an evaluation and possible cat scan.  Patient also now had some paracervical neck pain which I also said should be evaluated.  Patient and girlfriend both insisted they didn?t want an ambulance called and girlfriend felt comfortable taking patient out of the clinic.  Patient said he was hungry, and they were going to get food first.  Girlfriend gave me her phone number (xxx)xxx-xxxx and I gave her my phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx).  I told her I was going to call her every hour to check on patient and told her to call me at any time.  I recommended acetaminophen for the headache and other vaccine symptoms but no ibuprofen because of the possible head injury.  I recommended to immediately call an ambulance or go to an ED for nausea, worsening headache, confusion, or drowsiness.  Girlfriend is not to let patient sleep longer than 30 minutes at a time.  Patient was able to walk out of the clinic easily under his own power without any assistance.  He stated he was feeling much better.

                                                Patient noted on form that he had a severe reaction to peanuts which causes him to have anaphylaxis.  He stated that he does carry an EpiPen and any time anything with peanuts touches his mouth/lips he immediately notices his throat starting to close.  He also is allergic to cats.  Before administering the vaccine, the patient noted that he does not like needles and was not going to look.  I administered the vaccine and the patient and I exited the vaccination room.  I explained that he should sit in the waiting area for about 30 minutes due to his severe allergic reaction in the past.  By the time that I walked back into the pharmacy, the patient&#39;s wife shouted &#34;He&#39;s not breathing!&#34;.  My technicians called 911 while I grabbed an EpiPen and rushed to the patient.  I immediately administered a 0.3 mg dose of epinephrine and observed that the patient had passed out, was not breathing, but had a pulse.  A few seconds later he regained consciousness and his breathing was erratic.  I gave him water and he stated that he felt very lightheaded and dizzy.  I instructed him to remain seated.  He also noted that his vision was blurry and he saw a black dot.  His wife was fanning him to cool him down while I tried to obtain the patient&#39;s blood pressure, but could not get a reading.  The paramedics came and evaluated him thoroughly.  His blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, and blood sugar were all within normal limits.  They determined that the syncope was most likely due to the patient not eating during the day and not liking needles.  The patient was feeling much better and declined further medical treatment, including going to the hospital.  He was instructed to go home and relax.

                                                Ever since about 2-3 hours following my vaccination shot, I felt soreness in the left arm where I received the shot. It felt as if somebody punched me in the arm fairly hard and 2 days later I am still unable to move my left arm around too much. It is imperative that I can access my car whenever I need to so this is a major inconvenience for me and if this can be avoided or if all patients can know beforehand about this effect I would feel better about this entire thing. I did not know my arm would be sore for this long.

The pharmacist returned to the pharmacy and shortly after was notified by another customer that someone had fallen down.

He was assisted to a chair and was responsive to questions. A few minutes later, he lost consciousness again and emergency services were contacted. He was taken to the hospital.

They immediately put me into a wheel chair but I wasn?t getting better until they laid me down in the stretcher. My lips turned blue and I think I was having an allergic reaction to the shot. It was hard for me to breathe before laying down on the stretcher my heart rate dropped and my blood pressure. It took me 30-40 min to come back to stand up and slowly walk out. My arm was super sore afterwards and I would have little shocking pain flashes in my chest. I felt tired and run down/ sensitive the rest of the night. The next day my arm was still super sore and I still feel very tired and run down.  The doctor on site took care of me and they put the stickers on me just in case they needed to revive me. I was sinking quickly but luckily when I laid down I got better.

He went to work and was unable to move his arm and had to leave work early and took the next day off as well. He said this continued for three days after the vaccine. He reported that he did contact his physician who told him to give it some time and if it  got worse to make an appointment to be seen, stating that all they would do is give him an anti-inflammatory to reduce swelling. The patient told the physician that he already had some for another condition and would just use that and did not go in to see her. He said that it was still not 100% on 5/19/21 but wanted to proceed with the shot in the same arm.  He was able to make circles with his arms over his head after the immunization was given a little lower that where the first one was administered.  He said he had looked up the symptoms that it might be a frozen shoulder/nerve issue.

As he was moving to a recliner, patient passed out. The pharmacist called 911, and raised patient legs onto a chair. Patient woke back up, and the pharmacist said that his eyes were &#34;not normal&#34;.  Paramedics arrived, and transported patient to the emergency room. Patient states that he was at the ER for approximately 2 hours, and then discharged. While at the ER, he received IV fluids and blood work was performed. He has not had any other complications besides a sore arm at the site of injection.

The last thing I remember was the feeling of falling forward. I woke up sometime between 10 seconds to 2 minutes later feeling exceptionally dizzy and tired. I?ve never had any event happen like this before and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Today I am still feeling slightly dizzy and not quite right.

                                                4 weeks following 2nd Moderna Vaccine, I started having symptomatic Bigeminal PVC&#39;s that lasted approximately 45 minutes. Symptoms included dizziness, near syncope, palpitations, and shortness of breath. After 2 ED visits, I was referred to a cardiologist who ran tests to include a Holter monitor, and echocardiogram. I followed up with a Cardiac Electrophysiology Doctor who prescribed Flecainide to control the PVC&#39;s. I have been on Flecainide since early March, which has controlled the PVC&#39;s to a tolerable level (roughly 100/day). Before the Flecainide use, I was having roughly 1,000 PVC&#39;s a day, and had multiple episodes of Bigeminy.

                                                Following administration of the vaccine, the patient and his wife were seated and I requested they remain seated for 15 min after because I had recently had someone with a fear of needles collapse after their shot, at which point I had already counseled on the things to expect afterward but the patient stopped responding and slumped over. I was unsure if he was breathing as his wife was cradling his head, so I shouted for a technician to call 911. I heard a sound that I perceived to be wheezing and administered an epipen at which point the patients limbs began to contract so I then suspected it was a seizure. We lowered the patient to the ground and shortly after he became responsive. He was able to state his name and date of birth and breathing was unlabored. Pulse ox was 98 and HR was 88 BPM before  EMS arrived. They examined the patient and determined it was &#34;anxiety induced response&#34; but also noted that the bloodpressure was &#34;very low&#34; which is consistent with anaphylaxis, but I did not examine the patient at that time. He was sent home afterward.

But two hours later the knee continued to ache. He will recover in about two weeks.  06/16 I started to have a headache in the morning, and then my dizziness continued until now. The headaches had previously only occurred on the day of the second dose and the next day. Chiropractic, acupuncture, and massage have not worked. I&#39;m waiting for an MRI.

He appeared pale at the time but a few minutes later looked normal.   He was anxious about the vaccine.  We were about to call the ambulance and he refused to let us saying he was fine.  He expressed that he didn&#39;t want any medical attention.   He also reported after the event, that he hadn&#39;t slept the night before or eaten anything that day.  We would not let him drive himself home.  He had his brother pick him up.  We explained what had happened, and will follow up with him to see how the patient is.

                                                Had no symptoms prior to injection. After injection, quickly developed moderate pain at injection site that eventually became severe. Over the rest of the day, developed a severe headache, severe muscle aches (not just at injection site), severe fatigue, fever of 100.6F, moderate joint aches (not just in arm, but all over body - neck is worst), and general weakness (I almost fell walking to the bathroom and I&#39;m in decently good shape). Toward the evening, I started struggling with thermal homeostasis - I was simultaneously sweating and shivering. The combination of these was severe enough that I had extreme difficulty sleeping last night and woke up at least once an hour, getting &lt;6 hours of sleep after lying in bed for almost 12 hours. Right now (23h post vaccination), the pain at the injection site has gotten significantly less bad, but I still have a splitting headache, fever of 100.3F,  moderate fatigue/weakness, and mild muscle/joint pains across my whole body. I&#39;m unsure how much the headache this morning is from sleep deprivation.   At no point did I lose sense of smell or taste, have a sore throat, cough, runny nose/nasal congestion, or shortness of breath.

                                                Approximately two hours after injection, slight discomfort and soreness about 2 inches in radius below the the injection site, but not at the point of contact. Movement of the upper arm produced some levels of pain, but nothing noteworthy. It was uncomfortable to sleep on, though, so that was avoided. Lower arm unaffected.  The following morning,  the pain was immediately noticeable and made using the arm a severely difficult task. It was painful to move the forearm above stomach level, and essentially impossible to do any sort of heavy lifting with it. Pain relieving medication such as aspirin and ibuprofen helped in a minimal capacity, and was ultimately irrelevant in the healing process. These symptoms lasted the entirety of the day after the injection and most of the following day as well, subsiding mostly in the evening. Today (Thursday, third full day after), all pain and soreness/dullness are entirely gone. The second full day was easily the most intense in terms of pain.

                                                Patient was given a covid vaccine on 3/4/21 at approximately 5:40pm.  The administration went well according to the patient.  After approximately 10 minutes, while the patient was sitting in the post vaccination area, he appeared to be pale looking to the imx RPh.  The pharmacist asked him how he was doing, he replied &#34;I am doing so-so&#34;.  The RPh got up to check on him further when the patient fell to the floor.  The RPh rolled him on his back, got him in a comfortable position,  and elevated his legs.  RPh applied gauze to a cut in his lip, and with the immediate assistance of the health screener, applied cold compress to his neck and forehead.  Patient experienced faintness and sweaty skin only.  Patient did not show any other symptoms.  After about15 minutes, patient said he felt like himself again, and wanted to sit up in a chair.  The RPh assisted him into a chair, where he sat for 5 minutes.  At the request of the patient, he wanted to go home.  RPh escorted patient to his car and watched him get inside safely.  1 hour later, RPh followed up with a phone call to the patient and he was on his way to an urgent care clinic to get a possible stitch for his lip.

Red swelling that is warm to the touch and slight itchiness.  Extends around from the tricep to bicep and mostly below the injection site, down to near the elbow. No pain besides that of a normal IM vaccination.  Currently still experiencing the symptoms, but not taking any treatment as none are necessary.

The following night, 3/4/2021, muscle pain in upper back started to develop. The morning of 3/5/2021 the muscle pain had spread from upper back to neck and shoulders. The pain was severe enough to impede the ability to get dressed or drive.  I took Ibuprofen and noticed little relief, then took 1g of acetaminophen and experienced some relief. Pain persisted at same degree until the evening of  3/7/2021  where pain had started to noticeably subside. On morning of 3/8/2021,  armpit discomfort had ceased and muscle pain and been reduced to that of very slight soreness.  as on 3/10/2021 all pain had disappeared.

The condition has not improved, and it is now 39 hours after injection. Regular, everyday tasks are very difficult. Pain is about a 7.5/10.  Also, 24 hrs after injection I experienced a fever. The fever lasted for 12 hours without coming below 103 degrees, and went up to 105.2 degrees at its highest. This was accompanied by extreme chills. I have also have body aches, which are likely a result of the fever, and the fact that I haven&#39;t slept in 2 nights because of these side effects.

                                                We had a patient who got Covid-19 vaccine on 03/23/2021 at 11:32 and was feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  Patient reported to pharmacist while he was sitting on chair. So, I advise him to lay down on the floor with elevated feet. I also provide cold compress to the patient. I checked his blood pressure, and it was within normal range (124/76, 126/78) with the pulse rate was 60. Patient reported that he did not eat anything since morning, so he thinks his lightheadedness is due to low blood sugar. I gave him water after he set down back on the chair to make sure that he is hydrated well enough. We observed him for total of 45 minutes to make sure he was feeling fine before he left the pharmacy area. Patient called family member to pick him up.

At 1722 patient fell out of chair and onto floor. PharmD started emergency chain including 911 call and call to patient&#39;s emergency contact. PharmD ran to patient and observed him lying facedown with head facing left. Eyes open but unresponsive, his name was called with no response. Right as he was observed to be breathing normally with a steady pulse, patient had mild seizure with jerking movements. He was turned to his side during seizure event lasting no longer that 2 minutes. Patient then regained consciousness and was kept on his side. Was alert and oriented. He knew where he was, who he was, what day it was. He was able to answer all 911 dispatcher questions relayed to him. Dispatcher advised he could sit up on floor, which he did. PharmD stayed right behind him until paramedics arrived. He was kept talking to stay alert. It was unknown if he hit his head on the initial fall. Paramedics arrived and checked BP/Pulse/EKG. Pt then had a gasp/shake attack that paramedic notated as a panic induced episode. He calmed and was transferred to ER

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine  About 8 hours after receiving the second dose of Moderna, almost all of the side effects came in full force including headache, dizziness, fatigue, full body aches, injection site pain, chills, and elevated temperature. The peak severity lasted about 4-5 hours. It wasn&#39;t possible to sleep at all the night after the shot. After that 5 hour period, lingering side effects included headache, fatigue, and aches. About 22 hours after the shot, I decided to take some Tylenol to help get rid of the residual side effects. At 24 hours after the shot, it appears most effects have subsided but there is residual dizziness and some fatigue and weakness.

He was rolled from prone, assessed and had a pulse but initially was not breathing. 911 called Within 10 second, had spontaneous return of respirations, consciousness and was oriented to person, place, time. Sustained an abrasion to his head, complaints of mild HA, no neck pain or signs of cervical injury or other trauma. Vitals monitored. Given fluids, juice. Assessed by paramedics and refused transport to ED for further evaluation. Given ice and called a friend for a ride home. Observed for nearly 1 hour after LOC and had returned to baseline mentation. Advised to call 911 or go to ED if worsening of HA, vision changes, confusion, falls, nausea, vomiting due to concerns for head trauma. Assessment is that this was likely a vasovagal episode and patient reported similar experience with immunization in past, in retrospect. Discussed that this is not a contraindication for 2nd dose but that he should be sure he is well hydrated and advise healthcare providers of history of vasovagal with first dose. The county will work with him to schedule 2nd dose at a health clinic attended by EMS (on site).

EMT came in and took him to the hospital, at that time he said he started feeling better.

                                                Patient has history of passing out when getting blood drawn. As patient was standing to get vaccination card filled out, he told associate to call RPH that he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ran out to give my attention and patient was sweating and looked dizzy. His eyes started to shut while he was standing and as I was holding his arm and back to support him he started to fall to the ground. Patient gently went to the ground, I pushed him over to one side and he was out for about 3 seconds and woke back up. Patient was very hot and sweaty. He wanted to move to a more private area so I made an area with a privacy panel available to him. Patient stated to me that he has no history of seizure, but suffers from mild anxiety. Myself or one of the associates was with him for approximately 45 minutes just to make sure he was ok. His blood pressure was taken (twice) and water was given. His BP readings were normal. Patient was on his way. Moderna series completed.

                                                I got the vaccine and the following morning I had the worst headache I have ever had. I felt like my head was going to explode, and I took ibuprofen and Tylenol. I also had a fever and excruciating pain at the injection site, this all went away within 3 days. On 05/07/2021 I woke up with a really bad headache and I was dizzy, I took ibuprofen and Tylenol and it seemed to be getting better. And finally on 05/11/2021 I woke up again with a headache and dizziness, this is the day I went to my primary care doctor and he told me that he has seen this pretty frequently with the moderna vaccine. He said that it was brain swelling and inflammation. He told me to take ibuprofen and Tylenol every 6 hours for a week and that if I was still experiencing these side effects then I can come back and he will prescribe me steroids.

Patient was ok after vaccination for about 15 second, then got very dizzy and light headed. He leaned over on the table and remained there for several minutes. I had a wheelchair brought over for him to sit in once he was confident in getting up. He felt more secure in the wheelchair than in the waiting chairs because those have no arms. He stayed in front of the pharmacy for about 30 mins while he recovered. He eventually felt good and wanted to stand and move around on his own. He decided to make a few laps around the store to be 100% sure that he was good before leaving. He assured me several times that he was feeling better.

                                                Woke up at 3:00 AM Friday 5/24 having chest pain near my heart and issues breathing. I sat up on the corner of my bed feeling dizzy. Every time I would take anything more than a light breath, I would get a tight pain on the left side of my chest, which specifically felt like I had blockage in my heart. As I sat on the corner of my bed I tried to control my breathing and started to rub the area as I was taking breaths. The sharp pain in my chest while taking normal / deep breaths lasted for a few minutes and I feared I was having a heart attack. After going away initially that night, I felt the sensation  in a less intense fashion again later on Friday night and once more got a slight tight feeling in my chest while breathing on Saturday. During the initial episode on Friday night, I also got a deafened noise in my ears as if they had to pop as if I was gaining altitude in a plane or something. I got up off my bed to go to the bathroom and sat to urinate in case I was going to faint. The deafened noise went away after about a minute or so and turned into a static / fizzy noise for another minute or two while I was in the bathroom.  (The static fizz sounds got louder as I put my chin to my chest for some reason.) I was also sweating profusely throughout this entire process.

                                                The same day as the injection I experienced severe pain a few hours after in my bicep rather than my shoulder where I experienced pain during the 1st vaccine dose. I also experienced the common fatigue. However, at 12:13a.m on May 25th, I was woken from sleeping to what can only be described as either the most severe case of the shakes that have ever been experienced, or convulsions. I was unable to move, speak, and could hardly breathe. The effects of this lasted well over an hour and a half. It was only after what I was experiencing stopped, that I suddenly became burning hot, but did not have a fever. 98.7° was what was read at the time I started to feel hot. Since then I have experienced severe joint and knuckle pain on my left hand, still bicep soreness, pain in my left forearm, again joint and knuckle pain in my left hand, and headaches.

He went to purchase a water about 5 minutes after vaccine in a different register and was feeling lightheaded. After the transaction he fainted with the back of his head fell on the hard floor. He was being assisted by the store staff as well as a pedestrian who claimed to be a health care professional. He was given an orange juice, one water and a battery powered fan to provide cool air. He also requested to lay down on the floor, and he ended up laying on the floor for about 30 minutes. After that he stood up and regained color on his face. He then walked out of the store. Staff asked him if he wanted the ambulance to be called and he declined.   Pharmacist called patient the next day to check on patient, and was unable to reach the patient.

I chalked it up to the side effects, until i went mountain biking and had to turn around after there was so much resistance and pressure in my chest. I&#39;m glad I turned around when I did. It continued to be a deep constant pressure for over a week after the shot. Eventually the pressure subsided but I also didn&#39;t do any physical activities after the mountain biking experience.  As i tld the Dr.s this same story they told me I should have gone to the emergency room... Of course I didn&#39;t know, so I went about my life just reducing physical activity. I went in for my second shot today and was informed of the new possible linkage between myocarditis and vaccines. What the Dr.&#39;s described (I had two in the room this time because of the way I reacted to the first shot) was exactly what I felt after the first shot. If I was having the same symptoms, as recently discovered, but only after the first one, I wasn&#39;t going to try and find out if I would die from this second one or how much worse the inflammation would be.  I will disclose, pertinent or not, that I am a small individual at 5&#39;7, 120.

                                                From May 14, 2021, I have started experience dizziness and weakness in my body. There has been slight fever during the initial days but the weakness and mild headache is still there till today i.e. June 9 2021. I do experience a little shortness of breath and chest pain (on both sides) sometimes but that is not continuous and remains normal most of the time. I have got stomach infection and constipation too during these times and I have taken a pill of Prilosec upon prescription of doctor. Stomach looks good and bowel movement is fine as of now. I have been monitoring my blood pressure and body temp during these days and they all were normal.    Apart from that I experience chills more than anyone around me and don&#39;t know if that is related to vaccine effect.  Currently, my main concerns are - mild headache, weakness in body and dizziness which is happening for almost a month now.

                                                I woke up on May 20 with head pressure behind my ears, back of head, and sinus area and dizziness when moving my head or staring at something. That stayed around and than about 10 days later the stiffness in my head went down to my neck and shoulders. Which than led to muscle aches, twitches and a tingling feeling going down my left arm toward my ring and pinky finger.  The muscle aches continued in different areas of my body. Over the past 2 weeks my legs have become more stiffer and now I am getting leg aches cramps and tingling on my left leg with muscle twitches down to the base of my feet. All of these problems have been going on for about 2 months. I had a neck MRI done which said everything was normal. Went to an ENT doctor for acute sinusitis but none of the medications and Prednisone worked, my neurologist thinks it?s vestibular migraines but I have never had a migraine before. My primary doctor did a couple rounds of blood work and everything was normal.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine. The pharmacist administering commented on the odd response I had to the shot in my arm and within 1 minute, I said, &#34;I don&#39;t feel so good&#34; and began to have my first seizure. I fell out of my chair and hit my head on one of the CVS shelves. My wife was with me and the pharmacist called 911. The nurse came from the back and propped my legs up as I laid on the floor. Within minutes, the fire department and EMS arrived. They took my blood pressure, blood sugar and vitals which all were normal. I then began to have another seizure in which the EMS team assisted. They loaded me onto a stretcher and took me to the hospital in an ambulance. This entire course of events occurred within approximately 6 minutes of receiving my first COVID-19 vaccine. At the hospital, I received a chest X-ray, EKG and blood and vitals tests which all were normal. They concluded that it was an unexplainable reaction to the vaccine. I have no history of seizures and am a healthy 27 year old male. I take no prescription drugs, walk daily, work out regularly, eat a healthy diet and drink a gallon of water a day. Since receiving the vaccine, I have soreness on my head from hitting it on the shelf and a bite mark on my tongue from the seizures. I have been sleeping 12&#43; hours a day for the last two days.

Symptoms completely resolved on Thursday 1/7/21. I also experienced symptoms of vertigo (dizziness and nausea) beginning Friday 1/8/21 that lasted till 1/10/21 and am not sure if related or not. I do have a history of vertigo and am prescribed meclizine. Meclizine was taken with minor relief.

Did not take painkillers due to hearing it would interfere with vaccine uptake. Most symptoms except for headache had gone away by 30-hour mark. Only some lingering fatigue and achiness left over past 36-hour mark.

The next day I woke up drenched in sweat and with the chills and a fever of 101.5, I think. And then the joint pain started. Especially in my knees. I applied icee hot and drank some pepto. And only ate a few crackers to have something in my body, tried to drink a lot of electrolytes. By Sunday night I woke up every hour from joint pain, especially my knees and lower back. I woke up in the middle of the night shivering and unable to get warm. I took a warm shower, and had to sit on the ground and just let the warm water run. My knees were in so much pain I couldn?t stand. Monday morning I woke up with a fever of 100 but tolerable joint and stomach pain. By Monday afternoon my fever had gone down, but still has abdominal pain, headache and mild joint pain.  I Was able to eat dinner chicken soup.

I gave the vaccine and patient immediately laid on the floor with legs up.  He felt better, then dizzy again.  Then better.

He did drink some water and felt better. He thought he may have been dehydrated , anxious about the shot, and concerned when reading the shot info.  He has had flu shots in the past but  has not been  to a doctor in recent memory. The paramedics checked him and offered him a ride to the hospital . His vitals were fine so they released him to his girlfriend who was able to drive.

After 5 minutes in, he began to feel dizzied, chill, sweaty, stomach pain, and wanting to vomit. He gave us permission to call 911 for him. We gave him a cold compressed to put around his neck while he waited for paramedic to arrived. They came and took his vital signs and asked couple questions. His vital signs were good and they discovered that he did not have lunch, he only had breakfast for the day. He felt a lot better after 20 minutes so he got released by the paramedic to go home.

I offered him water and he accepted stated he was ok. 15 minutes after receiving  his vaccine the patient started to feel dizzy and raised his arm to alert me. I went to his side and asked if he was ok and he stated that &#34;it&#39;s happening&#34;. His head started to fall back and body started to slump to the side. I supported his head and called for the other pharmacist who came over and we were able successfully  get the patient to the floor in the  supine position. I left the patient with the other pharmacist and called 911. By the time I came back he was awake and talking . He remained in the supine position until the medic came and took vitals. We had him sit up and within a few minutes back into his chair where I remained with him until his wife arrived.  I gave him a water and approximately 1 hour after the incident the patient left with his wife.

                                                The day after, I had the normal fever, flu-like symptoms, and my left ankle/right knee ached pretty badly. Starting Monday 05/17, my right knee was unbearably painful. If I moved it at all away from a ~30 degree angle, my entire leg lit up with the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt. Not as bad as if I put pressure on it though, that was even worse. I couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t drive, could barely get out of bed for days. I got through that with over the counter pain killers and Biofreezing the knee like crazy.  Starting Friday 05/21 I believe, my knee pain suddenly went away only to be replaced with pain in my left foot. It&#39;s not nearly as bad as the knee was, but the entire left side is in constant pain made worse with pressure. I can drive now that my right leg works fine, but still can&#39;t walk without some form of assistance. I was reporting all of this in the V-safe health checker, but it apparently doesn&#39;t care outside of 7 days. Tempted to put &#34;permanent damage&#34; for Item 21 as the result, but I&#39;m hoping this goes away soon.

Patient was asked if he normally does well with vaccines prior to being administered the vaccine and stated yes, but that he is not particularly fond of needles. Approximately 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient collapsed off of the chair onto the floor in the waiting area. The patient was able to break his fall and did not hurt his head. The patient was helped into a laying position and was shortly given a bottle water. Patient declined the need for an ambulence. Patient is not diabetic. After about 15 min the patient was able to walk around. The patient&#39;s sister-in-law came to take the patient to urgent care just to be safe about the patient&#39;s condition

                                                Just after midnight, I was watching TV with my brother after smoking a medical pre-roll (I&#39;m a medical marijuana patient). Shortly after, I began feeling dizzy. I finished my glass of water and the dizziness subsided for roughly ten minutes, before returning even worse than before.  I went to get more water and after filling my glass and closing the refrigerator, I was barely able to walk the few steps from my kitchen to the living room to lie down on the couch.  At this time, my chest started feeling tight, and I had a light tingling sensation in my feet and lower body.  When I closed my eyes, the dizziness got worse, and laying in certain positions made the tightness in my upper chest become painful. I continued to drink water and ate a little, but the episode lasted between 30-60 minutes of mild discomfort ranging to a decent amount of pain. There was a moment when I had considered going to the hospital, but after eating, drinking, and doing some controlled breathing, the pain lessened I ended up falling asleep on the couch.  I woke up feeling considerably better, but decided to call out of work so I wouldn&#39;t do any strenuous activity. On occassion I still feel like there&#39;s a little bit of pressure or tightness in my upper chest,  but nothing painful or debilitating like the night of the incident

                                                Started the day great and went and got the 2nd dose of Moderna on 6/12/21 at 940am. I felt fine throughout the day and I started getting a little dizzy and disoriented around 5pm  and as it was explained to me it would be expected to get side effects. Later in the evening around 8pm I started to get extremely dizzy, tired, and having a low grade fever of 100.5F. I Later developed a headache and I had to go lie down for the rest of the night. As I was sleeping throughout the night and waking up multiple times shivering and being extremely cold, I was taking my temperature throughout the night and It would be climbing up from 100.5F and it reached 103.7F. At that point I wanted to get up and take some fever reducer medicines but I was unable to get out of the bed as I was very dizzy and disoriented and I was having extreme muscle and joint pains that I wasnt unable to move at all. I needed to go to the restroom and get a drink and I was unable to do that.  I had considered going to the ER but I waited it out and wouldnt go unless my temperature kept rising. I eventually tried going to the bathroom but at that point I had passed out and woke up in the morning between my bedroom and bathroom. On sunday 6/13 I was continuing to have symptoms and felt extremely ill throughout the day.  I woke up and the fever had gone away but I still had the symptoms mentioned above and also had ringing in my ears. Throughout the day I was trying to do stuff around the house but I was unable to do that and go to work. I would randomly pass out at times either on my desk or just sitting on the couch. That was throughout sunday then on monday I was feeling a lot better almost all symptoms had gone away but I was still a bit dizzy and had body aches and was unable to go to work and do basic stuff around the house. Tuesday I was mostly feeling fine but still felt a bit dizzy and disoriented and extremely fatigued but I was able to go to work. Wednesday I am feeling almost 100% normal but I do get dizzy at times and I am still extremely fatigued.

                                                On May 11 2021, I went to the gym to workout my back muscles in after work (around 3pm). After completing a heavy set of rack pulls I got light headed. After removing the weight to put it away, I accidentally dropped 25 pounds weight which was abnormal because I lost grip while light headed. I tried to walk off the pain by walking to the other side of the gym and within the next 10 minutes my face started turning pale and my lips dark blue/purple. I was sitting down as I progressively grew more light headed and started blacking out. My brother called over several people to help me maintain consciousness and an employee noted my lip and face color, low pulse and high rate of breathing. I fainted for a couple minutes then took a sip of gatorade and bounced back. I felt like that was a near death experience. Possibly related to some heart issue. A few weeks after I got a physical checkup at my doctor&#39;s office and the bloodwork came back clean. I have nothing to show why this episode occurred and feel like I should have some heart tests as a follow up.  Before this incident I have been going to the gym without ever having experienced this kind of issue. What was notably odd though is I started having some chest pains not too long after my 2nd vaccination that I originally attributed to a bad sleeping position (I sleep on my side). I would have tightness that at times were consistent. Overtime the pain got weaker as I stopped doing intensive workouts. I thought it could&#39;ve been a muscle tear but a tear would&#39;ve healed by now. I still experience a bit of tightness when I do heavy chest exercise or if I compress my chest muscles and squeeze in the middle.  I&#39;m submitting this report because its been recently identified myocarditis is a possible side affect of the vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

                                                Moderna vaccine dose #1 received in right shoulder on 12/31/20 at 2:15PM. Injection was uneventful other than sensation of pressure. I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head. I am concerned with the possibility of long term and/or permanent damage after reviewing the literature. I am also concerned about how many other healthcare workers the person who gave me my vaccine may be injuring and/or causing permanent harm to.

                                                Asthma Reaction; Dizzy; Lighted headed; Difficulty breathing; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who is a 29-year-old male patient that received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced dizziness, light headed, asthma reaction (asthmatic crisis) and difficulty breathing.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included pantoprazole 40 mg.  On 28-Dec-2020, approximately three hours prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28-Dec-2020, the patient developed dizziness, became light headed, experienced an asthmatic reaction and difficulty breathing. The events were treated with a dose of albuterol. The patient was transported to the Emergency Room but additional information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, dizziness, light headed, asthma reaction and difficulty breathing was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                About 5 to 10 minutes after the shot I felt extremely lightheaded and then fainted.  When I came to about 10 seconds later, there was a public health official there rubbing my chest asking me if I knew where I was.  It took me a second to fully come to my senses but then I realized where I was and what had happened.  I was very pale, felt chills, was sweating, and it took effort to open my hands.  The EMTs ran a bunch of tests, my Blood pressure was low (I think the number I remember was 104/33), but the rest of the measurements like blood sugar or the number of ekg like tests they did all came back normal.  The EMTs in the field said they think it was a response to the vaccine.  After about 20 minutes of the EMTs monitoring me, my numbers came back up and I was feeling relatively normal.  I waited another 30 minutes before leaving just to make sure.  It has been almost a week and I haven&#39;t felt any symptoms close to that since then.

Patient was given a cold cloth around the back of his neck and his blood pressure was taken and it was 82/58.  Patients O2 sat was 98 and pulse was 78. Patient stated that he was allergic to nuts. We asked if he had eaten breakfast this morning and he stated that he had a bowl of cereal. I instructed for someone to have him sit on the ground and to get him some candy  and a sugary drink.  A package of skittles was presented along with a Mountain Dew.  After finishing both the candy and Mountain Dew  (aprox 4 mins) the patient started to get a little color back and he stated he was feeling much better.  A second set of vitals was then taken which were  BP: 106/78 the O2 sat 98 and Heart rate was again at 78.  We instructed the patient to please hang around for 30 more minutes and after that time left with the person he was with.

                                                This patient felt fine with the injection and for the 15 min following. He was dismissed to check out and make a follow up appt. While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day. Instructed him to make sure he is well hydrated before he comes for his second dose vaccination.

                                                Patient received 1st dose of Moderna at approximately 12:30pm on 3/18/21. He did not stay the recommended 15 minutes on site for observation. He drove himself back to vaccination clinic parking lot at approximately 1:40pm and got out of his car hurriedly to get his mask from the trunk before speaking with EMS on site. He then reported to EMS his wife witnessed him have a seizure (eyes rolled back, unresponsive, stiffening of arms and legs) for 2-3 min approximately 1 hour after receiving his shot. He reported when he regained responsiveness he asked his wife what had happened as he reportedly had no recollection of the seizure, they decided to call the patient&#39;s sister and she directed them to return to site of vaccination to report his seizure.  EMS who evaluated patient reported he denied (and was not exhibiting) postictal signs/symptoms when he arrived back in parking lot at vaccination site. He denied having a history of seizures or any medical conditions. EMS also reported that neither the patient nor his wife called 911 after the seizure. Patient declined any further medical evaluation/follow up. EMS urged him to call 911 if he had anymore seizure activity to which he replied he thought if he just rested Friday and through the weekend, he&#39;d be fine to return to work on Monday.

                                                syncopal episode- 1:33 pm individual fell head-first off from chair in observation area and hit her head. I was called over by the observation person that someone needed attention right away. I ran over the individual was lying on the floor and her husband was sitting on a chair right next to her. He said she fainted and fell forward. The individual appeared to be unconscious when I arrived and was very diaphoretic. I loudly asked if she was okay and then tapped her chest. She looked up at me and said ?oh snap.? She was oriented to person and place and her pupils were equal, round, and reactive. She denied that she had any tingling in her arms or legs. She said she heard everyone talking to her, but thought she was dreaming. She said that she has a history of passing out with finger-pricks (she cannot donate blood anymore because of this), shots, and she passed out when she got a piercing in the past. She said she felt her HR slowly starting to climb, but she felt she would be okay. She said she then started feeling lightheaded and passed out. I took HR BP at  1:35 128/74, 62 and again 5 minutes later 128/80, 62. Individual was given an ice pack for her head. She had a bump on the upper right side of forehead. She said she had not eaten or drank much before her shot. She said her stomach was a little upset. She was given water and granola bars and sat up for a while before standing up. She asked if I thought she should get her head checked out. I said it is never a bad idea to get checked and since she did hit her head hard enough for a bump to happen right away. Individual was feeling better before she left, stating just her head hurt. We told her to ice and ibuprofen or Tylenol to treat discomfort.

                                                Every night since getting the vaccine around 2:00 or 3:00 AM I am woken up by intense pain and stiffness inside my left elbow joint. The vaccine was administered in my left arm. I cannot go back to sleep until I straighten my arm out and support it with my body by laying on my right side. During the day there is slight tenderness to the elbow joint, but otherwise no pain or symptoms. As of 4/12 it now feels like I have partially torn my Achilles&#39; tendon where it connects to the bottom of my heel in my left foot after trying to lightly stretch it while standing talking to someone in my office. I am fairly active outdoors and consider myself in otherwise good health so these two events post-vaccine seem very odd to me.

                                                Typical side effects began next day(4/18), Arm soreness at injection site, headache, feeling of fatigue, breathing feeling slightly off,  but subsided after the second day (4/19).  Third day was completely fine (4/20), Morning of fourth day (4/21) wave of dizziness and fatigue began accompanied with feeling of pressure in ears with occasional ringing. Also headache at the back of the head and where the cervical spine meets the skull. Occasional congestion. Hard to concentrate and occasional lightheaded feeling. Going on one week since injection and 3rd day of dizzy spells. (4/24)  Treatment: Drinking mostly water. Diet consisting mostly of vegetables and grains (no changes have been made to my diet) Ibuprofen 200mg seems to alleviate earache which in turn relieves some dizziness but feeling of being off balance remains.  No previous history of any sort of vertigo or ear infections.

                                                on -03/25/21 I Injured my back doing an sitting dumbbell overhead press. The injury occurred while pulling the dumbbell from the ground into an overhead press position.  The injury felt muscular in nature, there was no pain after the first few minutes, I was able to complete my workout without any pain.    03/26/21 - Received Moderna Vaccine first dose  03/27/21 - Worked out again with no pain, avoided aggravating the area just in case.   03/28/21 - Woke up with debilitating back pain, unable to fully stand, dull stabbing pain shooting from lower back into hip and then into knee.   Following week I was unable to stand upright without intense pain, received Celebrex and muscle relaxers which did little to help with pain, Doctor then put me on 1 week of prednisone, an anti-inflammatory steroid which did not appear to do much.  Four hours after starting steroid use I decided to stretch my psoas muscle, despite incredible pain I managed to get it stretched out, I could walk upright with reduced pain afterwards.  For the next week the pain would gradually get better.    04/19/21 At this point pain had subsided to about 10% of pain at its worst point and has gradually gotten better, pain is almost non-existant at this point.  I noticed that my right quadriceps muscle had atrophied in comparison to my left quadricep muscle.  04/22/21  Began self-administered rehabilitation, slight increase of pain during workouts.  Noted that my right quadricep had gotten significantly weaker and had from visual inspection lost about 40% of it&#39;s muscle mass, left leg  feels hard to the touch while flexed, right leg is mushy to the touch while flexed, one month prior I could do squats of 285x8, now my right quadricep could only complete 5 reps of 15lbs on single leg extensions, my left leg could still do 40&#43; reps without failure.

                                                30 April 2021: I had slight soreness at the site of injection that morning that gradually got a little worse overall by the evening... no other noticeable symptoms. Had a protein bar and cold brew coffee for breakfast prior to vaccination. Approx. 45 min after the vaccination I ate a donut, then an hour later a ham &amp; swiss sandwich for lunch. For diner approx. 8 hours later, I ate a KFC chicken sandwich and an order of popcorn chicken.  01 May 2021:  I woke up with it feeling a bit more sore than in the evening... still very tolerable though... 3/10 overall on a pain chart... throughout the morning through mid-afternoon I felt no other noticeable symptoms. Ate a protein bar and some cold brew coffee for breakfast that morning, but nothing else before my AE.  At 17:05 Pacific I get a work-related phone call from a client (I work in IT as an executive support specialist) and assist them for approx. 30-40 minutes. At that point I&#39;m working on my laptop sitting cross-legged in bed.  Adverse event: During that call, I start to notice that I&#39;m slightly more sensitive to motion as usual, making me dizzy if I move around too much. By the end of the call, I&#39;m feeling dizzy but I attribute it to hunger. Some time around 18:30 Pacific, I go downstairs to eat. However, by the time I get downstairs and try to prepare some sushi, I feel so dizzy I need to sit down on the couch to stop the room from spinning. I go upstairs a couple minutes later to try and sleep it off. I&#39;m laying on my back at that point. I think I rested for about 25-35 minutes with my room dark. I then get up slowly to see if things got better but everything is still spinning and is getting worse. I try to rest in bed more, alternating laying on my back and my right side but it&#39;s still getting worse. Sometime around approx. 20:00 Pacific, I go to the bathroom to puke but nothing really comes out since I hadn&#39;t eaten since the morning. I go back to my room to try and sleep it all off.  From that evening on 01 May 2021 to 04 May 2021, I&#39;d sleep 12-15 hours on average each day to get rid of the nausea and dizziness. I normally sleep 6-7.5 hours (bad sleeping habits due to work/surfing the web on phone - never resulted in these symptoms before though). It gradually went away until going away almost completely by the 04 May. However, as of 10 May I still feel like the potential for the nausea is there... just ever so slightly lingering as a slight heavy feeling in my head that feels like it will spiral out of control if I start spinning around too much. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just due to my relative lack of sleep since 05 May (more bad sleeping habits). Otherwise, I feel back to normal.

He then reported the dizziness had subsided and he developed a headache. The numbness in his arm continued. He was given water, ice pack, and tylenol while at the pharmacy. He felt well enough to go home with his father, but too ill to drive. He did not require emergency treatment.

It was uncomfortable nut not painful. No fever, no malaise. I did feel nauseous during this time. 2 weeks after my vaccine (around 05/22/2021) I had a weird sensation that my left arm went numb and I couldn&#39;t really control it 100%. I went to the ER because I thought I was having a stroke and because of my experience with Bells Palsy. They didn&#39;t do anything because I was in the lobby waiting for 2-3 hours and they seemed rushed and they told me that I must&#39;ve been sitting in weird position because my arm went numb. They didn&#39;t do any tests.

                                                Around 11:15 am, Jan 17, 2021, while standing at the toilet, my son either lost his balance or fainted and fell to the floor.  He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

                                                On the night of the 20th, I experienced a mild headache and minor left arm soreness. I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

He was dazed and said he just felt off. When he stood up, he fell down and felt very dizzy.  We were doing a vaccine clinic at his place of employment that day so I was still on site and he came back into the room I was stationed around 1:30pm. He said he felt ok, was talking, breathing fine, just felt a little &#34;off.&#34; He had white spots all over his left arm and some on his right.   None were raised, red, or itchy. His left hand was red/purple in color. I gave 50mg of diphenhydramine and he stated about 10 minutes later he felt better.  I observed him for approximately another hour. He was walking around, talking fine and stated he felt normal when he left. He still had some slight discoloration on his left arm.

                                                During the 15 minute observation period after injection, patient returned to the check-in desk complaining of dizziness. He was brought immediately to exam room where he became pale, diaphoretic, and stated he &#34;felt like he was in a dream.&#34; Seated BP was 74/palp. He was placed in supine position on exam table, cool compresses placed on forehead and back of neck. He complained of some nausea, which quickly improved. He never lost consciousness. His color and alertness improved steadily over the next 10 minutes. Repeat BP (lying) was 100/50. After a few minutes he sat up on exam table, dangling legs. BP remained stable at 110/60, HR 84. He continued to improve and stated that he felt better, drank some water and ate some goldfish crackers. Reported that he just remembered he had not eaten since lunch. After another 5-10 minutes he was alert, oriented, able to walk unassisted. Final BP 114/70, HR 80. His wife remained with him and confirmed she could drive him home. Discussed that although I feel confident this was a vasovagal near-syncope, if symptoms recur or worsen, he should go to ER for evaluation. Understanding verbalized.

He attempted to get up and and fell to the floor. He was awake, alert and spoke intelligently while EMT team was being expected. After about 10 minutes he sat up on the floor and was doing just fine. He stated that he believed his reaction to the vaccine was because he had not eaten prior to getting it. The EMT arrived after about 25 minutes from when incident started, took his blood pressure and measured his sugar levels and both were fine. Patient declined an emergency room offer from the EMT, ate a chesse burger meal and left the store. Pharmacy has followed with 3 phone calls, but patient is yet to respond.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

Between 24 and 48 hours after the shot, about 3 inches below the injection site, I noticed my arm began swelling, getting very red, and radiating heat in patches. Over the next few days, it grew until it completely covered from the middle of my upper arm to my elbow. Sunday, March 28th, the redness and swelling is fading finally but still noticeable. Also the 3 nights following my shot, I dealt with severe lightheadedness and dizziness, but only at night

                                                Shot was given in left deltoid but upon needle insertion I could feel that I was not in the muscle. Was still able to inject vaccine. After removing the needle the patient straightened his posture and I could tell that the injection was too high and more in the shoulder area. Patient said that he felt okay and no pain but then returned 3 hours later complaining of shoulder pain and limited range of motion. I instructed him to ice the area 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off and to take Ibuprofen. Area was not swollen. Upon follow up later that evening he said he was having a hard time laying on that side and was more comfortable sleeping in a recliner. He said he was still having pain the following morning and was going to go to an urgent care for further testing.

                                                I have pain in my left shoulder area on and around my deltoid muscle, especially when lifting my arm up (e.g., like when I am trying to put on  a T-shirt). This pain was severe for the first 3 days or so before becoming only moderate/mild pain.  The problem is that it has now been almost exactly TWO MONTHS since I had that injection, and I still have that same mild/moderate pain when lifting my arm.  I am surprised that it has not healed, and so I am reporting it.  I will note, if it matters, that I don&#39;t think they administered this second dose very correctly-- instead of the middle of my deltoid muscle, they placed the injection very high and posterior on my shoulder, almost on the acromion process(I am an RN myself, which is why I feel qualified to talk about proper IM injection technique).

We got him to the ground safely with feet up and used a cold pack. He regained consciousness quickly.  He sat up about 10 minutes later and left about 15-20 minutes later.

I laid down and these feelings seemed to pass after 30 min.   Later that day I started to feel a strange feeling in my head that is hard to describe. It is a combination of light headedness, slight dizziness, and general head fog. These symptoms have persisted for 7 days now. They were mild to start and have gotten increasingly worse the last 2 days. The symptoms make it hard or impossible to focus on work depending on the severity at the time. I feel these symptoms whether I am sitting down or moving around, although it seems to be most pronounced when I am moving.   Today was the first day I that I had to call in sick to work. I have not yet sought medical treatment, but as symptoms are worsening, this will be my next course of action.   I have found

No other signs of allergic reaction upon examination.  Laid patient down and checked blood pressure which was normal (127/85). Patient stated that he still felt the same after several minutes of observation and felt little to no improvement.  Because he stated that he felt some tightness in his chest he was given 50 mg of diphenhydramine orally and EMS was called.  Patient stated that he began to feel better after the diphenhydramine.  EMS arrived and took vitals, patient refused going to hospital and left the pharmacy.

                                                Patient received his first Moderna COVID vaccine. While he was waiting the 15 minutes he started to feel pressure behind his eyes, started sweating profusely, felt dizzy, and nauseous.  I had the patient go into the IMZ room where I had him sit down.  I took his blood pressure. His heart rate was 55 bpm and his blood pressure was around 110/70.  He was not having any trouble breathing or had any signs of anaphylaxis (swelling of throat, tongue, lipps, etc). I had him remain seated and talked to him for 5 minutes. He felt like he was starting to come out of it and we took his blood pressure again.  His heart rate and gone back up to 65 and his blood pressure was around 135/75.  I had the patient remain seated for another 5-10 minutes.  Took his bp again and the numbers were similar to the second one that was previously mentioned.  He wanted to stand up and see how he was feeling.  He stood up right outside the pharmacy for another 15 minutes and said that he felt back to normal.  I explained that in the previous case where this happened to a woman they recommended she have someone drive her home and I recommended he do the same.  He seemed to think he was fine and I believe he was planning to drive himself home.

Next morning 5/5/21 had headache.  At 11am took nap and was having an episode almost like &#34;sleep paralysis&#34; where he would wake up feeling like he couldn&#39;t move and gasping for air.  He reports he did this sleeping and waking for about 1 hour (he had no problems sleeping the night before.)  He woke up after an hour and had vomited in his sleep - he thinks he choked a bit on it.  But when he woke up his breathing was normal, movement normal.   He then only experienced fatigue and headache for the rest of the day.  Then by next day felt totally normal.

Then he went to our waiting area and about two minutes later he slumped forward into his girlfriend. I ran out there and helped him out of the chair and onto his back on the ground and he immediately felt better.

Sunday morning (6:00 am) presented with chest pain for about ten minutes that subsided. Sunday night/ Monday morning at approximately midnight (12:00 am) presented again with chest pain that continued as we sought medical attention from local fire department, to which an ambulance was called, meds were given and diagnosis was heart attack from labs drawn at hospital. Took him back for a heart cath and there was no blockage. From everything I was told they couldn&#39;t figure out what caused the chest pain.  He spent 2 days in CCU. He discharged Wednesday the 12th of May. He is now on Plavix, Coreg, a low dose aspirin, and Atorvastatin.

I CHECKED THE HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE, ASKED THE PATIENT TO SIT ON THE GROUND AGAINST A WALL, GAVE THEM WATER AND SNACKS TO HELP BRING BLOOD PRESSURE AND BLOOD GLUCOSE UP THEN CONTINUED TO MONITOR FOR 45 MIN WITH FREQUENT CHECKING OF BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE. THEIR BREATHING WAS NORMAL AND TALKING JUST FINE.

                                                Reporting primary symptoms: headache, fever, lightheadedness, elevated heart rate, arm soreness, muscle soreness, back pain, nausea, suppressed appetite, anxiety, and panic attacks. (see below for more information) Initially, felt faint and lightheaded. Stood up and the feeling worsened. Within five minutes, felt nauseated and clammy. Also, appeared pale in the face. Was given instructions to sit, close eyes, and take deep breaths. Applied a cool, wet rag to the face and neck as needed. Was anxious and may have had a panic attack triggered by the experience. Heart rate had elevated, but not to a concerning level. Within 30 minutes of initial vaccine administration, face was no longer pale and heart rate was lowering. Other symptoms mostly subsided within 90 minutes of the vaccine administration. The next morning (5/19/21), woke with a mild headache, low grade fever, some fatigue, slight nasal congestion, and very sore arm. Took Tylenol for fever and it was mostly gone by the next day (5/20/21). Felt well enough Saturday (5/22/21) morning for lots of physical activity (push-mowed lawn in humid conditions) and only had a mild headache and mild fatigue afterward. No notable symptoms on Sunday (5/23/21) morning, but had indigestion, gas pain, and some soreness (back muscle) late that night. Stayed up a little later than normal. Woke a few hours early (around 4:30 am) on Monday (5/24/21) with throbbing low-to-mid, left-side back pain and worsened indigestion and gas pain. Had anxiety that led to a panic attack. Did not feel well and tried stretching, taking Tums, deep breathing, used the bathroom, and walked around. This was helpful enough to return to sleep. Woke up again at 8:45 am and had a mild headache, some soreness in neck/shoulders, and anxiety about the situation. Took a shower, did some deep breathing, and tried to relax. Drank some caffeine at noon, but the headache was not relieved. Appetite was somewhat suppressed and was mildly lightheaded. Stomach became more unsettle by night. Stopped all caffeine intake and NSAID usage (and still no intake/usage at the time of this report). At night, anxiety over the situation worsened, so tried deep breathing, talking to others about the situation, and stretching. Panic attack occurred, but was able to manage with the aforementioned techniques. Woke the next day (5/25/21) with mild headache, muscle soreness in mid-to-upper back, shoulders, and neck, suppressed appetite, and anxiety. Was able to manage most symptoms with breathing, stretching, relaxing,  and talking through the situation. No panic attack on 5/25/21. Went to bed earlier than normal (around 9:30 pm) and woke on 5/26/21 around 9:30 am. Had similar symptoms, but appetite was more decreased and worsened anxiety. Decided to see doctor that afternoon (see item 19 for more information on testing from that visit) and was told to give more time to recover from vaccine side effects. Did not give doctor information about anxiety or panic attacks at that time.  Had a panic attack (less severe than previous) Wednesday night and managed with the aforementioned techniques. Thursday (5/27/21) morning woke with no headache and no fever, but still some soreness in neck/shoulder area, suppressed appetite, mild fatigue, and mild anxiety about the situation. No panic attack on 5/27/21. Friday (5/28/21) woke with similar symptoms and decided to visit doctor again about anxiety. Was prescribed Buspar and Zoloft. After taking Buspar (first time ever) at 2:30 pm, experienced an increased heart rate up to 160bpm and a low fever up to 100.2F. Experienced another panic attack during this time. Sought medical assistance from local ER around 3:30 pm. Was seen and monitored until discharge at about 11:45 pm. During stay, tests and levels were mostly normal except during a panic attack that was triggered after blood was drawn. Treated with Vistaril around 11:20 pm and monitored for about 20 minutes before being discharged. Anxiety was relieved after deep breathing and relaxing. Did not take Zoloft. Slept and woke on 5/29/21 with mild headache, unsettled stomach, and mild anxiety. Anxiety is more manageable so far and other symptoms were somewhat improved after eating breakfast. Currently, no plans to continue taking Buspar, but will consult doctor.

As I arrived, 10 seconds after fall, his eyes were open but he could not see anything. He was able to state his name, date of birth, and where he was, just couldnt see. &#34;Everything is all black.&#34; After closing eyes for 30 seconds, opened and he could see, but everything was green. Vision color was back to 100% after 20 minutes but still blurry. Patient BP was normal. Sweating.

                                                First dose: my face went numb and tongue felt itchy 1.5 hours roughly for symptoms.  No common side effects; Second dose: calling it a panic attack. Racing heart, felt like I was passing out, mental fogging, trouble swallowing lasted about 1.5 - 2 hours. After 2nd dose I had the normal side effects, headache, chills, body aches fatigue.. After about 2 days of common side effects I noticed I was having trouble swallowing and it felt like I was being choked pulse food regurgitation and diarrhea.  It kept getting worse and worse after a week or so of hell I get an emergency endoscopy showing I have  eosinophilic esophagitis.  I?ve been put on all sorts of meds that are supposed to be treating this but nothing is working.  It?s been near a month now and 2 weeks have been on a hard core elimination diet  symptoms are persistent and discomfort it spreading to what feels like intestines, kidneys and possibly other locations I now have to go in for a colonoscopy soon as the meds should be working and discomfort is spreading.  Loads of headaches can?t sleep with all the discomfort.  Never hungry.  Possible permanent esophagus damage maybe more everything is still being diagnosed and no one is really finding any answers why.  For the last 6 years I?ve been on a health kick working out almost daily and eating very healthy.  No symptoms no warning  signs these one or more diseases it has all just started out of the blue post vaccine nothing else in my life has changed.

He was extremely diaphoretic and once he woke up began dry heaving and vomiting. He stated he was too dizzy to stand and just wanted to lie down. We called an ambulance to come and treat him. He explained to the paramedics he had been out drinking and partying late the night before and did not eat or drink anything before he came to get his vaccine. We determined that he was more dehydrated and hungover than having an actual reaction to the vaccine itself.

                                                Roughly 20 minutes after injection I quickly started to feel nauseous and light headed. I made me way back to the pharmacy (barely) which was around 50&#39; or less away. On my way there my vision started to fade away and go white then would come back. I made it to the counter, said I was sick, and collapsed on the ground as I could no longer stand. I quickly became more sick, became very hot, and started sweating badly. I needed to vomit but since I had not ate that day (not uncommon for me and the pharmacist was aware before I received the shot) I could not. At the same time as I was in the floor I had to put all of my concentration into not shitting my pants in front if everyone staring at me. I remember them asking me if I needed an ambulance and I don&#39;t remember responding or being able to process what was going on. They did call and ambulance and by the time they arrived I was feeling better. After collapsing they took my blood pressure while waiting for the ambulance and they told me afterward it was 81/61. When the EMT&#39;s were there they tested it several times and said it was normal. They also tested my blood sugar which was 111. They ran an EKG and said everything looked fine. They recommended I go to the hospital but I declined as I was afraid to get billed for it as well as not having a way back to my vehicle or most importantly someone to watch my dog. Though I probably should of gone. As an added possible beneficial piece of information, I went through a similar experience years ago when donating plasma.

In May 2021, the patient experienced CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and disability). On an unknown date, the patient experienced BRAIN OEDEMA (Brain Swelling) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant and life threatening), SKULL FRACTURE (Multiple skull fractures) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant and life threatening) and MOVEMENT DISORDER (trouble picking things up and raising his legs) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and disability). The patient was hospitalized from 04-May-2021 to 20-May-2021 due to BRAIN OEDEMA, CRANIOCEREBRAL INJURY, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS and SKULL FRACTURE. The patient was treated with Surgery (On 07-May-2021, right part of skull was removed surgically to control brain swelling.) for Brain oedema; Surgery (On 08-May-2021 surgery was performed to remove multiple skull fractures.) for Skull fracture; Rehabilitation therapy for Confusional state; Rehabilitation therapy for Movement disorder and Rehabilitation therapy for Speech disorder. At the time of the report, CRANIOCEREBRAL INJURY (Brain trauma), BRAIN OEDEMA (Brain Swelling), SKULL FRACTURE (Multiple skull fractures), CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) and SPEECH DISORDER (Could talk but not rational) was resolving, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out) had resolved, FALL (Fell on cement floor) and EPISTAXIS (Bleeding from nose) outcome was unknown and MOVEMENT DISORDER (trouble picking things up and raising his legs) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       On 26May21 patient moved to a rehabilitation facility where he still remains 9Jun21.  He  awoke on 17May21 but was still confused. He is now making good progress and can now walk and talk but needed therapy to relearn these.  He  will need out patient therapy when they release him.  He still requires surgery to replace bone flap and has to wear a helmet. The goal is that he will be normal in 6 months but he is still having trouble picking things up and raising his legs.

I was sick for the next few hours, vomited for around the first hour after. Symptoms of dizziness for the next two days, then Vertigo/dizziness/vomiting again the following night. After around 3 more days, the symptoms subsided. I had my 2nd Moderna shot on 5/18/2021 (Lot 036C21A) and on 6/10/2021 the symptoms began again. After the first case, I saw online Urgent care and was referenced to an in-person visit to a primary care doctor. I was &#39;diagnosed&#39; with BPPV, which I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms of before. They ran me through several tests at the office, but by the time I got to the primary care doctor the symptoms had subsided again. I&#39;m currently still experiencing a light dizziness 24/7 since 6/10/2021.

About 5 minutes after his shot, a woman walking by heard him say he felt like he was going to pass out and caught him as he was falling out of his chair. Staff member heard the commotion and immediately got my attention. I instructed him to call 911 and went out to the patient. As I got to the patient he was beginning to regain consciousness. The woman said the patient had hit his head on the shelving that was behind the chair. I gave him some water and had him stay seated until EMS arrived. EMS checked him out and released him into the care of his family.

                                                you read that correctly, the 2nd dose was THE WORST! I am going to attempt to type this again, yall timed me out while typing. If the CDC hadnt asked then I wouldnt have bothered with your reporting system timing me out.  Symptoms started the day of the shot, started with soreness and some sinus issues, however things escalated quickly! I received a high fever at one point (think 104 if I remember correctly) and everything went to DOWNHILL, stupid hot cold swings of massive extremes. One moment I would feel so hot it was like standing on the surface of the sun, then suddenly so cold it was like I was frozen on Pluto. I would get cold grab a blanket and be hot, then take it off and freeze, literally no in between, I was either severely cold or extremely hot. Experienced all the sinus issues, running, drainage and dryness back and forth, arm was basically useless, fatigue and lethargic symptoms were stupid extreme, I remember leaning up in the bed and trying to open a water bottle only to find out I physically was not capable of squeezing the cap enough to turn it, I had to attempt with every fiber of my being and last ounce of strength to turn that dang lid and eventually got it, but if it hadn&#39;t turned i likely would&#39;ve died, just didn&#39;t have the strength to move. After 3 days of AGONY around noonish or 1ish I started to feel a bit better, like a switch flipped and the hot cold spells stopped. Things got better after that, but oddly some weird symptoms seemed to persist and currently still persist. Had very, very vivid and strange dreams for a while after (these seem to have subsided) and odd tightening of muscles that persist. Currently my jaw is tight on the right side and when opening it leans to right and sometimes pops. something in my arms, legs and wrists (I think its a ligament) tightens up and becomes sore. Not sure what that&#39;s all about, but I was asked to report this stuff so here it is!

Again after 18minutes of getting the vaccine, same thing happened. I was in a sitting position for 20min. After 22min i felt itching on my left foot finger and neck for few minutes. I feel these are side effects of vaccine as i never had such feeling before for any medication.

In the recovery/observation area, he became pale and lightheaded.  His companion asked for help from EMTs stationed in the room.  After I spoke with the patient and at my suggestion, the EMTs helped the patient onto a gurney so he could recline and recover.  The patient was fine after 15 minutes, declined further care, and walked out of the room in the company of his companion.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was fine until after a few minutes.  He started to say he felt lightheaded.  He placed is head between his knees, he started to sweat and I gave him some water at his request.  He sat back and started to get pale and more sweaty, he complained about pain in his arm and neck.  He then began to slightly shake and passed out.  He was awoken very quickly by his wife who was standing in front of him.  We kept talking to him and I checked his pulse and called 911.  After about 30 minutes he was feeling much better and did not need to go to the hospital.  His vitals were strong and he walked out on his own.  I contacted him 3 hours later and he was resting but feeling fine.

Patient then slightly stumbled as if they were about to faint. Staff technician caught patient by the arm and staff pharmacist helped bring patient slowly to the ground to lay flat. Patient noted no signs of difficulty breathing, throat closing or other respiratory symptoms. Patient breathing improved per patient once he was down on the floor and noted that while he was fallling he slightly lost consciousness.

Patient BP remained stable at 115/81 while both laying flat, sitting on a chair, and standing up straight upon firefighter instruction. Paramedics were cancelled and patient opted and signed to drive himself home. Staff pharmacist persuaded patient to stay another 10 minutes after firefighters left to be monitored.

                                                I gave him his shot and he was a bit nervous about it.  He went directly to the waiting room afterwards.  About a minute later he started hollering for us.  We went over to him and he said he was dizzy and his eyes were blacking out.  I took his BP.  It was 88/64.  He said he had not eaten so we got him some fruit juice and crackers.  He said he was feeling better so I took his BP again.  It was 130/94.  He waited a few more minutes and then went home.  This happened over a period of 15 min.

                                                At approximately 9:00 PM (roughly 11.5 hours after vaccination)  I became extremely light headed with slurred speech. I experienced tunnel vision and dizziness. My face turned white, and my lips were a blue color. I sat down immediately, which improved my condition temporarily.   But, within 2 minutes I began experiencing tunnel vision and dizziness again while sitting upright. I laid down on my back and elevated my legs.  My vision returned and but I remained dizzy and pale. I experienced some numbness and tingling in my extremities.  My wife attached a fingertip pulse oximeter to my finger at this time (we did not have a tool to check blood pressure on hand). My blood %SpO2 read between  95 and 98% and pulse ranged from 95 to 101 bpm.  I did NOT experience: difficulty breathing, swelling of the airway, nor itching.   Since I was not having difficulty breathing, and my symptoms seemed to indicate low blood pressure or potentially low blood sugar I decided to wait it out and see if my symptoms worsened.    While laying on the floor, I consumed a glass of milk and a few oreo cookies, hoping to counter hypoglycemia (if that&#39;s what was going on).  After approximately 15 minutes my condition began to improve - I could sit up slightly with only mild dizziness and color began returning to my face. After approximately 30 minutes, I was able to stand and walk to my couch and lay down. After around an hour, I was feeling almost back to normal with only a slight dizziness and tiredness remaining.  12 hours after the adverse event (24 hours post vaccination) I feel okay, slightly lightheaded but generally fine. I intend to call a doctor and discuss if any further tests are necessary.

                                                So I got the vaccine on January 23rd and the Sunday following I started noticing I was getting very dizzy I went to the ear doctor they said it was not my inner ear so I went to a heart doctor and they did a tilt table test and the tilt table suggested orthostatic hypotension. The heart doctor did alot of heart tests and the heart is good. My vision was blurry with constant headaches went to an eye doctor and I have onset strabismus in my right eye and then I went to a neurologist because the tips of my toes were numb . The heart doctor has me on fludrocortisone and metropolol because my heart rate was very high all the time ever since the vaccine it was stuck at 130 to 150 beats per minute no matter if I was resting or sitting. My pupils oscillate and ever since the adverse reaction started I have had pupillary athetosis or hippus. Horrible brain fog can&#39;t think clearly or sleep well insomnia came with all of this as well. I go to the mayoclinic, because dysautonomia is expected.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was asked to move to observation area.  Shortly after sitting down the patient came back to pharmacy counter and stated he was feeling dizzy.  Just as the pharmacist was telling him to sit back down he fainted and fell on the floor.  He recovered rather quickly (matter of seconds?) and tried to sit up right away.  Pharmacist asked him to stay on the floor for a moment, the store&#39;s first responder (MIC) was called over to pharmacy.  After a minute of sitting on floor the patient got up on his own accord and transferred to a nearby chair.  His BP was taken twice per emergency protocol of pharmacy.  Patient initially appeared calmmy and BP  was 132/81, pulse 44, respirations 18 at 12:25p.   BP was 142/89, pulse 48, respirations 16 at 12:35.  Patient was given both a water and a Gatorade while he was seated.  Patient stated he had not eaten anything yet for the day.  Patient was repeatedly offered medical services (i.e. &#34;Do you want a medic? Do we need to call an ambulance?&#34;) The patient repeatedly refused any further medical treatment.  After further observation patient was able to stand, check out at the pharmacy and left the store on his own accord.

After a couple of mins the pt stood up and began to pace the room, at which time I asked the pt if he was ok and he responded that he was fine, but just a few moments later the pt got light headed and fell against the wall. He caught himself, but still hit the side of his head against the wall and this caused a small cut. The pt was immediately moved to sit on the floor with his back against the wall and at this point he seemed to lose conciousness and was moved to lying down. Pts BP was low for several mins, but improved to normal by the time EMS arrived. Pts vitals were checked by EMS and he was cleared to go home with his wife.

He was not responding when asked questions but was still breathing.  His hands had little tremors. Then after a few minutes patient was responding and talking to the staff. We still called 911 because patient was unresponsive again (second time). Shortly after patient was responsive again. Patient&#39;s spouse also came to the scene in a short time. His wife said patient had same problem previously when he had his blood drawn. Paramedics assessed that patient was stable and did not need further medical help. Patient left the store with his wife.  We recommended him to have second shot with primary care provider or at a facility with more medical assistance.

THen I was fine. A day before I hit my 2-week mark, I got really dizzy and started experiencing some mild confusion/forgetfulness, and had an inability to focus on anything.  It was so bad that I went to the doctor and he couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.  Then I found a forum online of people complaining about dizziness 2 weeks after their moderna shot and thought it best that I report it.

                                                The person who administered the vaccine was not careful. She injected the vaccine way too high on my right arm, pretty much directly in my shoulder!! Also she didn&#39;t put the needle in at a 90 degree angle, but she had the needle facing downward when she injected the needle into my shoulder!! I have been in intense pain ever since she gave me the shot. I can&#39;t move my arm at all. I am extremely worried that I will have SIRVA.

The patient said he started feeling light headed and laid down for a little. He started feeling better and sat down. Patient stated he had not eaten anything that morning. 911 was called as soon as the patient fainted and an ambulance promptly arrived.  Paramedics checked his blood pressure and blood sugar, which was 48. They gave him glucose tabs and his sugar improved. He felt better and did not want to go to the hospital and left on his own.

He awoke about 10 seconds later and was afebrile, aware of his surroundings, and showed no signs of anaphylaxis. He vomited after awakening. I asked him to sit in in the post-vaccination area for 30 more minutes while I monitored him. He refused EMS services, but I was able to get him to have a family member pick him up to take him to the emergency room.

He said his symptoms were gone by the time he decided to leave (35 minutes after the vaccine was administered).

Patient stated that just seeing the food I brought had him feel better. He was back up to 100% a few minutes after. After full observation patient was fine to leave.

I woke up on 05/26/21 at approximately 0120h feeling the need to urinate and was very sweaty, hot and thirsty. I sat down to urinate, and I felt dizzy standing back up. I was feeling very thirsty so proceeded to walk to get some water. I fainted after walking about 10 feet. I regained consciousness, and I drank water and ingested an Advil with the help of my wife. I felt a lot better after drinking the water, but still had a mild throbbing headache. I went back to sleep, and the fever symptoms came and went which affected my sleep quality. I drank more water any time I woke up. I took 2 more Advil as well at one time waking up. I woke up around 1300h on 05/26/21 feeling a lot better and a little more well rested. My fever symptoms are gone, but I am still a little sensitive to cold and feeling a little weak.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  About 10 minutes after I got the shot I felt a small pain in the left side of my chest. It lasted about two minutes before passing so I wasn&#39;t very concerned, I thought it was just part of the shot. About an hour after the shot the pain in my chest came back much worse. Ten minutes after the chest pain my arms felt numb. I struggled with opening and closing my hands. I have terrible insurance, no primary care physician and don&#39;t have the money for hospital bills so i didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. I slept a couple hours hoping I&#39;d feel better when I woke. It didn&#39;t help. The pain and numbness lasted about two days, most of which I tried to sleep through. I still have a off feeling in my chest that I don&#39;t know how to describe. My family tried to getting me to go to the ER but I resisted for the reasons mentioned. I&#39;m supposed to get my second shot on the eleventh but I&#39;m scared of what will happen.

                                                First Moderna Vaccine shot on 3/4/2021- Sore Arm dizziness but only lasted about a day.  Second Moderna Vaccine shot on 4/1/2021- Sore Arm dizziness Fever. The dizziness and fever went away after a day sore are lasted about 5 days.  After that was normal until about 2 1/2 weeks after the shot on 4/20/2021 I went to the hospital due to extreme dizziness,  ears hurt along with eye pressure.   At the hospital they tried to clean out my ears due to some wax which made me even more dizzy which they shot lorazepam into my arm to calm me down.  The was the same arm that got the covid vaccine in it so I wondering if that had any effect on my condition also?  They gave me meclizine to take as needed and told me I should go to an ENT to get checked further.    The doctor then took the wax out with a tool but bruised my ear drum due to this and gave me ofloxacin to clean the blood and said it would heal soon.  Nothing got better so I figured maybe I had some depression and anxiety due to this covid crisis and saw a therapist who prescribed me buspirone which did nothing but give me headaches and hydroxyzine after that to try and see if that was better. Both medicines did nothing and I stopped taking both after about a week.   I ended up going to the hospital two more times on 4/26/2021 and June 20/2021 and they just gave me amoxiciilin in June and said to see the ENT again  I went to the ENT once in April and again in June and asked about ear wax and dizziness. He said you don&#39;t have vertigo and that my ear drum was healed in the June visit

After about 1 minute post administration, patients eyes rolled back, begin to shake and slumped back into his chair. I tapped him on his shoulder numerous times and yelled his name as appeared unresponsive. At this point I notices his lips were turning blue so I administered an epipen in his right thigh and yelled to Technician to call 911. Within 2 seconds of the epipen administered, patient was responsive. I asked him his name, birthday, and where he was. Patient was able to provide all correct answers. He stated he felt a little warm and dizzy. I continued to watch patient and ask questions until EMS arrived. I also provided him with a cup of water. Patient stated he did not have any allergies prior to the administration of the vaccine. After this incident he said he felt lightheaded before when giving blood. When EMS arrived his vitals were within normal limits and declined being checked out at the Hospital.

                                                The following day I became increasingly fatigued, roughly 30 hours later I took a 2 hour nap. I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

While sitting down his eye rolled back and he passed out.  His spouse said his body was shaking.  She lowered him to the floor and he awoke.  Paramedics were called and determined his blood pressure was very low. They tried to stand the patient up to take another blood pressure reading, but the patient had to sit down as he became dizzy and lightheaded again.  The paramedics took him to the ER where the doctor said he was fine and discharged him.

The symptoms felt just like past instances of the flu I&#39;ve had.  Given this, I didn&#39;t go to work on 3/29, and instead went to get a covid test.  On 3/29, I also started to get consistent pain in emanating from the lymph node in my right arm, the same arm I received the vaccine in on 3/22.  The actual vaccine site no longer has any tenderness, and it was never painful after the shot.  I had no symptoms at all between 3/22 and 3/28.  The lymph node under my right arm is visibly swollen as well.  On 3/30, I was given the results of my covid test from 3/29, which was &#34;covid-19 not present.&#34;

                                                Felt a bit odd on the couch, little shiver and what felt like adrenaline. I got up and went into the bathroom where the incident occurred. I used to be on 10mg of Ramipril years ago and moved to 5 due to light headedness when standing up. Yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly. Getting up too fast with heart pressure meds prescribed for albumin /T1D and not for heart pressure. The secondary use of Ramipril is normal for type 1 diabetes after 20&#43; years. So I went to 5mg and haven?t had that issue since. I should also mention that when this used to happen to me I would lay down and recover with no problem.  Back to the incident it felt exactly like that but on steroids. I was in the bathroom looking for Tylenol and I got light headed, yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly, ringing in the ears, dizzy, and confused. I remember thinking I should probably get down on the tile floor and lay down like I?m used to from the episodes years ago with 10mg Ramipril causing the same symptoms but never anything so extreme. Next thing I know I?m on the ground waking up where I fainted and hit my head pretty hard on the way down. I probably have a minor concussion. Iced my head in the back where I hit it last night and this morning. Surprisingly 0 bumps, etc other than a little bit sore.  Trying to remember going down is impossible. There is a strange, I guess it?s not strange as I fainted, but to me being 1 moment thinking what I should do then the next moment still thinking that same exact thing but coming to on the bathroom floor with parents yelling over top of me as I was at their house is strange. I recall what almost felt like a dream while I was out but I was wondering why everyone was asking if I was ok, of course I?m ok I thought. Then I realized what happened and crawled around on the floor the rest of the night if I needed anything and was checked every hour through the night which was horrible but necessary.  Also my blood glucose was a 220 at the time of the incident according to my CGM so it didn?t have to do with low blood sugar.  In any case I feel better today but in a fog with a slight headache.

She immediately contacted the pharmacist and the pharmacist checked his pulse and talked to him.  His mom wanted him to be seen at the hospital so 911 was called and the ambulance took him to the ER.  He never passed out only felt like he was going to.   He felt better at the time he was taken away in the ambulance.

Talked with the patient and he was not very responsive then went unconscious where he was kept him from hitting the ground. I grabbed the patient to prevent them from falling, his eyes appeared to roll slightly and his leg twitched. He was unconscious  and unresponsive for approximately 10 seconds or less while making some grunts/groans. He came to consciousness and sat upright and began drinking water. He says he remembers immediately before but couldn&#39;t remember the exact event. The ambulance was called at initial event and arrived and took him at that point to continue checking on him. Blood pressure was approximately 117/76 with a pulse of 55 form blood pressure cuff over his shirt.

                                                I was released from quarantine from my Covid-19 infection 5 days prior to getting the first Moderna vaccine in the morning. By the evening, I felt sicker than I ever have in my entire life. I was shaking uncontrollably, had a fever, extreme chills, and a pounding headache and muscle aches. I didn&#39;t sleep that night and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until noon the next day. I am still lethargic today and seemed to have lost my sense of smell.   My Covid-19 symptoms from the 2 weeks prior were extremely mild and the vaccine experience was 1,000x worse. Something isn&#39;t right and I am questioning whether I should get the second shot.

                                                Patient came in excited to get his first moderna covid vaccine. Got his dose at around 1230pm and was instructed to sit down for 15 minute post -vaccine to make sure he felt ok before leaving.  About 10-15 minutes later, he came up to the cashiers and his face was pressed against the plyglass and started to go down.  (RPH) and (tech) ran out to catch him from falling to the ground.  We pulled a chair up to where he was so he could sit down.  He reported to be warm, weak, and dizzy.  He remained seated but was alert.  He has no allergies, no medical conditions, no prior reactions to vaccinations.  He last ate at 8:30am.  He said he felt warm, but I took his temp again and it was 96.7 degrees.  We gave him some water and he remained seated.  After several minutes, he was able to get up and was fine with moving his chair away from the front registers and towards the side wall (within sight of pharmacy).  Kept checking on him and he was getting better and better.  He did call his friend to pick him up instead of driving home himself.

He is also experiencing numbness and tingling down that arm. The injection site is clearly in the center of the deltoid, and not too high. Today he started experiencing blurred/halo vision, as well as quite a lot of dizziness.  He also said he was experiencing tightness in his jaw. We sent him home from work today. He was going to lay down.

                                                We had a customer pass out after a shot and came too quickly.  He began to fall forward several minutes after the shot and another customer pointed out that he needed assistance.  As I hung up quickly and went to the patient he was coming to and recovered.  I wasn&#39;t sure if he bumped his head but did not see any lacerations or signs of obvious severe injury. Store manager was contacted to help assess reporting through Incident reporting process.  His BP was 118/82 after spending a few minutes with him and giving him water.  He had a sweaty forehead and sat with us for a bit. I did offer to call an ambulance and administer Benadryl.  Patient declined.  He mentioned fainting with blood donations in the past, never with vaccines.  We discussed for second shot we will stand nearby ready for fainting again, or receiving the shot at an MD office in prone (lying down) position.  There was no answer to a follow-up phone call the next morning.

                                                I went to bed 2h after the vaccine, but woke up at ~6h after to find that the injected arm was mostly limp at the shoulder--I could only move it a bit before encountering muscle weakness and pain. I went back to sleep on and off until getting up at 17h after, at which point I could move the injected arm forward but not backward/outward. At 18h after, I took 1 capsule of Ibuprofen. By 22h after, I had regained full muscle range, with still some pain when moving it backward/outward.

After the event, the patient reported that after receiving the vaccine that he felt dizzy, and decided to sit down after receiving the vaccine in the waiting room. After a few minutes after feeling comfortable, the patient decided to stand up and get in line to schedule his second dose. He then proceeded to fall while waiting in line. He reported &#34;seeing black&#34; in addition to reporting sustained dizziness at the time of the fall. He also appeared to look pale. The patient was encouraged to lay supine as a wheelchair was brought to transport him from the waiting room to the urgent care for observation. The patient appeared to be in good spirits.

                                                I began to feel nauseous and lightheaded while brushing my teeth around 10:30 pm several hours after I received the first injection of the Moderna COVID vaccination. I sat down and started feeling very hot. I passed out a few moments later. I woke a few minutes or seconds after passing out and was evaluated by EMTs. They said my vitals looked good, but strongly recommended I go to the emergency room for further evaluation. The ER performed and EKG and bloodwork, both of which were normal. I was told this was most likely vasovagal syncope and sent home. I have had a previous history of fainting from injury or injections. This was different because the fainting has previously occurred minutes or seconds after the triggering event versus hours. Since that night, I&#39;ve  been tired and experienced occasional lightheadedness. I saw my primary care doctor today (4/21) and he advised me to fill out this report.

                                                Received my shot, talked with the nurse for about a minute or two afterwards in the back and she informed me that i needed to wait 10-15 minutes before i left. i go to the waiting room and set my alarm for 10 minutes. i texted my mother i was done and leaving  to go back home soon and that my second appt was on May 11. she texted back, i responded once again that i will call her when i get home in just over an hour.  Since i had no idea what to expect if something &#34;did go wrong&#34;, i picked up my packet of information i received prior to my shot and started browsing through. i saw the possible serious side effects column and started to go through the list. At the time, about 5-6 mins now afterwards of my shot, i had no difficulty breathing, i did have a little tingling in my tongue, i read &#34;a fast heartbeat&#34;, and put my hand on my chest and asked myself, IS MY HEART GOING FASTER? i looked at the paper again and put my hand back on my chest, and that was the last thing i remember until i was brought back to conscious by the nurses and doctors. i was told the guy in the waiting room ran after i passed out. when i came back to they walked me into the back, i was dizzy and profusively sweating and was drenched from head to toe , shirt and pants were SOAKED in sweat, they took my vitals for the next 40 minutes (3 or 4 times) i dont remember it too clearly until i started coming back to. Blood pressure was up and down and i was white as a ghost, they gave me fluids and i hung out until i felt superbly better about 40 minutes later. Then on my drive home, i had to pull over again, because i was getting light headed and felt like i was going to vomit. made it home, 90 minutes later, took a baby aspirin and slept the rest of the afternoon for about 5/6 hours before waking back up to eat some dinner.

The pharmacist had me place my feet up on a chair in front of me, gave me an electric fan  to point at myself and an ice pack that I applied to my head and back of neck. As the stars began to subside I felt a lump in my throat. The pharmacist then instructed me to continue to focus on breathing. Within 25-30 minutes I was clear of all adverse affects.

He showed photos of his arm with a circle around what appeared to be an injection in the front part of the deltoid muscle area. Patient related that he visited FNP (noted in this report) for evaluation within a few days of the shot. Per patient history, he declined imaging or other scans and elected to treat symptomatically using Naproxen. Per patient, symptoms subsided after a couple of weeks to the point range of motion generally returned but soreness remains. Patient desired to receive his second dose to complete series which was administered.

                                                Had soreness the next day deep in shoulder. That night i woke up at 3AM with a feeling of a dead arm in my shoulder. I had to leave work the following day because it felt like a constant dead arm. It gradually got better of the next week but I lost motion and its alot weaker than it use to be. Please have somebody contact me on this. I will have to go to the doctor before long and id like to talk to you guys first.

A nurse and a medical technician addressed his concerns and the patient was diaphoretic, lightheaded, pale, and vomiting. We immediately provided 1 adult dose of epinephrine, laid him down with his feet elevated, and contacted EMS. Once he was stable to walk we moved him into a private room to be further assessed by EMS. Vitals were taken every 5 mins until the patient was transported to a local hospital.

After a few minutes (at most 5) woke up and immediately felt better.  I believe this was due to the needle not the shot as I have felt light headed in the past almost any time I have gotten a shot.  This was the first time I passed out though (usually I am already laying down, or able to without getting up.   I was in a chair and could not).

                                                Within 30 minutes I felt confused and light headed and it reminded me of feeling like I had a concussion. I had dark spots in my vision and intense pressure in my head. As I had been told to expect random side effects I went home and went to sleep early. The next day I had a lack of motor function with continued intracranial pressure and confusion. I called my doctor and went to the Emergency Room where my Blood Pressure was recorded to be Hypertensive and then retaken. I was given a CT scan and sent home. I was unable to work  the rest of the week and was out of work after being sent home sick the following week. I continued to experience intense intracranial pressure and an inability to form short term memories for three weeks after vaccination. I still continue to experience intracranial pressure and episodes of hypertension but have more ease in forming short term memories. Intracranial pressure has nonetheless decreased significantly compared to the immediate onset following inoculation. My medical testing is ongoing.

                                                Body aches all over started the morning after the vaccine shot. Nausea began second day after vaccine and I threw up clear liquid that day. I?ve had no appetite and have lost about 5 lbs in 2 days from not eating.  I have dizziness as well but it is not severe enough that I cannot walk on my own. I have injection site redness as well. I am reporting these symptoms on the third day after my shot and I have improved but only slightly.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

                                                About an hour after the 2nd Dose of the Moderna vaccine I started to become dizzy, lightheaded, a minor headache also had an elevated heart rate for approximately 35-45 minutes. I went home took some Tylenol and laid down for about 2-3 hours and the heart rate went down to normal but the dizziness and Lightheadedness continued until the following day and that when I my right arm started to hurt around the injection site. Some Tylenol and massaging the muscle pretty much took away the pain.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

                                                I received the shot in my left arm. Two things happened upon injection (1) I immediately began to bleed from the injection site. I have been told the provider may have hit a capillary; it bled for about 45 seconds. (2) within 20 seconds of injection I felt faint and began to sweat; this was rather short and subsided within 2-3 minutes. I was concerned that because I began to bleed immediately after injection that the vaccine may have also been expelled, too. But given the following reaction just described and the soreness I continue to feel in my arm, I assume the vaccine was successfully injected. The shot provider was surprised at the bleeding, as was I, but unsure of the exact reasoning behind it.

                                                Patient lost color in his face, felt sweaty, lightheaded, and warm a few minutes after first dose (10:04 AM). The warmness lasted 2-3 minutes, and then he felt cool. The lightheadedness subsided about 10:15 AM. This is when his mother called me over and told me what was going on. His BP (using automatic cuff) was 110/58 with a pulse of 55. He denied any other sx, and said he ate Special K Protein and soy milk for breakfast. We gave him a bottle of water to sip, and he continued to sit with his head near his knees. At 10:30 AM, his BP was 101/56 with pulse of 51. He said the lightheadedness returned slightly, but the sweatiness subsided. By 10:43 AM, he said he felt all better. At 10:36 AM, he took his pulse manually, and it was 66. By 10:43 AM, he felt &#34;all better&#34; and his BP was 135/75 at 10:54 AM, with a pulse of 57 (per automatic cuff).

                                                The day after the vaccine, I suffered a bad headache, chills, fever, dizziness, and general symptoms that felt similar to those I felt when diagnosed with COVID19 in 2020. The majority of the symptoms subsided the following day and the pressure of the headache subsided within 48 hours of first symptoms.

I continued to speak to him and he was unable to hear initially.  He did cry out and gasp and tighten then started to have a few slow jerky movements bringing both arms and body up from the chair. It appeared as if he may vomit and I repositioned to ensure he would not slide off of the chair.  The movements lasted about a minute and then he started to come to.  He described feeling dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, and sweaty.  During the event his pupils were non responsive. At 11:17 he went pale and started feeling as if he was spinning and experiencing tingling.  He was still reclined in the chair and sitting up aided with the tingling.  He was given a cold pack to help regulate and given ice water at 11:18.  He stated he had not eaten yet today as he usually doesn&#39;t eat until 11. His temperature had dropped to 96.1 vs 97.5 prior to the vaccination.  BP was checked at 11:25 and was 120/72 which is lower than usual for him and to be expected with the LOC.  After drinking his water, I had him attempt to stand while grasping the wall/table for 2 minutes to assess his steadiness, then standing unassisted for 2 minutes.  After he felt steady enough we had him walk 10-15 feet and stand for another 2 minutes.  Patient was feeling tired and instructed not to drive home.  The situation was conveyed to his wife and they were instructed to seek ER/Urgent care if any of his symptoms reappeared. They stayed in the area to eat lunch and I checked in again at 12:12pm with the patient and he is feeling better after eating but still tired.  I also recommended following up with his primary as I will be sending her a copy of this report.

                                                Patient received first dose of COVID vaccine at 1:10pm without issue. During his 15 minute waiting period post vaccination, at approx 1:15pm, patient experienced a syncopal event, &#43; for striking his head. He never lost vitals, and promptly woke up. at 1:22pm, his vitals were initially BP 90/42, HR 45, pulse ox 100% on room air, and RR 16. He complained of dizziness and blurred vision, but was AOX3 with all cranial nerves intact. 911 was called for patient to be assessed. Vitals were then checked again at 1:29 pm, BP 110/62, HR 62, pulse ox 100%, RR 16.  At this time, all of patient&#39;s symptoms had resolved. EMS arrived at 1:39pm and checked his BS which was 114. At this point patient no longer wanted to go to ER. EMS spoke with on call provider who gave verbal okey for patient to no go to the ER, but gave strict ER precautions such as headaches, vomitting, vision changes, etc. Patient was able to teach back. Patient reports that this (passing out) frequently occurs to him anytime he has to get shots or blood work done and he has seeked medical attention afterwards before with no resolution. Patient left at 1:46pm. He walked home.

                                                Patient complained of dizziness and nausea following second covid moderna vaccination. We supplied water and chair and monitored him. While interviewing patient it was announced that he had consumed several beers during lunch 1-2 hours previously. He later told another front end associate following up with him that he actually had consumed whiskey. It is strongly believed that this played a large roll in his adverse reaction. It is believed that he experienced a mild syncopal reaction that was potentiated by the alcohol consumption.

                                                03/28: At 9 PM (9 hours after shot), I rapidly experienced fatigue, fever (101 degrees), chills, aches, and slight nausea. I took my vitals during this time: SPo2 of 98-99%, BP was 123/80, and heart rate was in the mid-to-high 80s. By midnight, I felt much better and assumed everything was over.   03/29: Woke up feeling fairly tired. As I was trying to do my normal morning routine of cleaning up, taking out trash, etc. I noticed a shortness of breath. No fever or other symptoms from the night before. I checked my SPo2 levels with 3 different oximeters, and all gave readings in the 93%-94% range. My heart rate, which is usually in the 80s and 90s when moving about, was in the low 70s, bottoming at 72. This was nerve racking. This along with intermittent dizziness persisted for 24 hours. I got COVID tested and it came back negative. Flu came back negative, too. A consult with a doctor inferred that &#34;everyone has different vaccine side effects.&#34; Not helpful.   This shortness of breath/fatigue/low blood oxygen saturation continued persistently for the next 48 hours. I was essentially advised to stay home and rest. I noticed some lymph node swelling, too.   By day 4, I was feeling much better. My heart rate had gone back up into the 80s, and my blood oxygen sat. had increased to 96-97%. I was still somewhat tired and got winded very, very easily.   It&#39;s been over two weeks since my second shot upon writing this. I didn&#39;t want to report, but I can&#39;t make heads or tails as to why this happened. The only change in my health was taking the vaccine. I don&#39;t have any blood clots, asthma, or underlying issues. However, these side effects, if they are as such, need to be discussed. I know others who got the Moderna vaccine with similar anecdotes. The difference is, living with a clinician, I monitor my vitals all the time and knew enough to take measurements.

Approximately 4 hours later, I developed flu-like symptoms for 36 hours, including an excruciating headache. I want to Urgent Care on the 3rd day (April 3rd) due to my headache and run blood work. That same day, I noticed that I was easily getting lightheaded. Even today (April 23rd) I continue to have lightheadedness every day, with certain things triggering it (e.g., tie my shoes, holding breath during deep breathing exercises to alleviate chest pain, lifting weights). Anything that requires my head to be below my chest makes me lightheaded after 2 seconds. I thought I was going to have a stroke or brain aneurism on the night of Easter Sunday due to my headaches, so I stayed up all night thinking that I could stay alive.

Then on 4/23 developed severe N/V and disequilibrium - could not move his head or stand up without needing to vomit. Received prednisone, antibiotics, and had ENT evaluation without notable results; no hearing loss/tinnitus. Eventually referred to hospital by ENT. Found to have lesion on CT head and subsequently had brain MRI (4/27/21) that showed multiple enhancing white matter lesions concerning for MS vs ADEM. LP was essentially normal (2 WBC, normal protein, normal glucose) with infectious serologies/PCR pending at time of submission. Received pulse dose steroids (1000 mg) per Neurology.

Five minutes after vaccination, mother noticed the patient was pale on forehead, followed by &#34;overall paleness&#34; a minute later. Patient reports feeling slightly light-headed five minutes post-vaccination. He said he also felt warm and slightly sweaty. Eight minutes post-vaccination, his mother said his earlobe &#34;lost color&#34;. The patient reported feeling cool and sweaty around this time and still light-headed. 19 minutes post vaccination (at 10:06 AM), patient informed me of how he was feeling, and I checked his blood pressure. It was 93/47, with a pulse of 55. He felt very hot to the touch, but his temp was 96.8 degrees. He brought a water bottle to sip water as needed, and he was given a cool cloth for his neck/forehead. At 10:10 AM, patient reported feeling weak and didn&#39;t want to talk. At 10:13 AM (~25 min post vaccination), patient reported feeling a &#34;bit better&#34;, and his BP was 104/57 (checked by other RPh). 34 minutes post-vaccination he reported feeling much better and was much less light-headed/able to talk. At 10:26 AM (~39 min post-vaccination), BP was 137/75, and his pulse was 60. 42 minutes post-vaccination, he said he was &#34;mostly back to normal; ~90%&#34;. Then, 46 minutes post-vaccination, he said he was 95% better, and he said he was &#34;good to go&#34; 51 minutes post-vaccination.

His face/lips were pale and after a few minutes of sitting on the floor he felt good enough to get up and sit back on the chair. I gave him a cold bottle of water. He was able to drink the water. It was hard to get specifically what the patient was feeling or experiencing because he did not speak English and also was mentally challenged. The paramedics were called and when they came they took the patient&#39;s blood pressure and pulse ox and everything was normal. After about 15-20 minutes they helped him to the car to make sure he was feeling better. We called later in the afternoon to see how he was doing and the sister said he was doing much better.

Almost lost consciousness. First to subside was the dizziness and loss of peripheral vision, muffled hearing after, tinnitus subsided around the same time of the body sweats. Only lasted 5 minutes, but was followed by a less extreme version of all the same symptoms an hour to two hours later. No episodes since.

Had dinner, went to bed for the night.  I was not able to sit up straight for more than 2 minutes the next day without getting extremely light headed. I did not eat for two and a half days. Spent the next several nights freezing cold and with night sweats. I also had a deep, phlegmy cough. It all started clearing up after a few days, but I felt crummy/under the weather for a week.

Went to the ER on 5/23/21 was given blood transfusion and IV because hemoglobin dropped from 9.1 to 7.1 after one bowel movement. He had endoscopy and colonoscopy on 5/25/21 and was diagnosed with a colon ulcer which they cauterized and he was discharged in the afternoon due to hemoglobin being stable at 8. The next morning on 5/26/21 he woke up to use the restroom, defecated brownish-black-red stool and almost fainted and couldn?t get up from the floor. I called Dr. (gastroenterologist) who told me to take him to the ER immediately. My husband, is currently back at hospital getting evaluated.

                                                Patient received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccines at outside facility on 4/1/21 and 5/19/21. On 7/11/21, patient presented to ED with sudden onset right eye vision loss while driving earlier that night.  He states that he completely lost vision in the right eye for 2 to 3 minutes.  It has since come back but now is blurred.  He denies any headache or eye pain. Visual acuity screening reveals Right Eye 20/25, L Eye 20/20 and bilateral 20/25. The pupil is reactive.  There is no evidence of retinal detachment by ultrasound. CT CTA did not reveal any evidence of carotid artery disease. COVID-19 status positive on 7/12/21. Patient is admitted to the inpatient unit with neurology consult. Neurology assessment: description sounds highly consistent with amaurosis fugax, and in the setting of known extensive cardiac history and possible hypercoagulability in the setting of positive COVID, would be concerned for an embolic event. Positive COVID despite getting Moderna vaccine x2. No respiratory symptoms, but concern for possible hypercoagulability event (embolic TIA causing some transient right eye vision loss). Patient is still admitted as of 7/12/21 with additional tests being performed.

                                                It completely messed me up. After I got the vaccine I got the normal symptoms, fever, chills, cough, and then I started having trouble breathing and very major back pain and chills. I ended up getting pretty bad hypothermia my body tempt dropped down to 91.2, my whole right side of my body was completely numb to the point I could not move my right arm or leg. 2-3 days later I ended up passing out in my bedroom. I was out of work for about a month and a half. I remember being very weak and trying to call for help and I just blacked out completely confused. I woke up again and then I tried to get up but I was to weak so I fell down in my bed. I blacked out again. I woke up very confused not knowing where I was. it took me a minute or two to realize I was still in my bedroom. I could not breathe so I drove to the hospital. They said I had double pneumonia, they gave me antibiotics, They also gave me an emergency inhaler that I am still using sometimes. I still sometimes have attacks that I cannot breathe and sometimes I cough off phlegm out of my lungs.  Also, palpitations rapid and slow palpitations. Also, light headedness, I walk around and I felt very dizzy so I would have to sit down and catch my breath. I lost taste and smell. My oxygen levels dropped too below 95.

Standing for more than a couple of minutes caused lightheaded feeling.   A high fever started around 5 pm that night and lasted until midnight when it seemed to break while I was sleeping after taking Tylenol.  The next day mild headache remained but was much better overall other symptoms did not remain.

                                                I recieved my second covid 19 vaccine by moderna.  I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

                                                Patient complained about feeling dizzy about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Before that time, he and I had been talking, and he said he had felt fine. He was put in a reclining chair and continued to feel dizzy, experienced a mild headache, slightly scratchy throat and skin and nausea. For a minute or so, he stopped answering my questions. At that point, I was becoming concerned this could be an allergic reaction, versus vasovagal episode. His vital signs were done, essentially normal with exception of elevated BP.  he was given diphenhydramine 50 mg IM and stated about 5 minutes after that, that his symptoms were slightly better. 911 was called when he seemed to be getting worse, not lucid. . EMTs assessment was same as mine, allergic reaction versus vasovagal.  His EKG NSR, vitals remained  the same. BP still high, not dropping. EMS staff suggested he go to ED, which patient declined. He was feeling better about 1 hour later.

                                                headache, fever (presumed), extreme chills, extreme dizziness,  extreme body aches. Worst of this was over by mid-day the following day. Chills, dizziness, and body aches continued mildly through Sunday.   I also passed out/blacked out the night of getting the vaccine while using the bathroom. Unclear if this was simply due to standing too quickly while experiencing the above mentioned symptoms and blood rushing to my head or a true side effect of the vaccine.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

Within seconds I was unresponsive for what appears to have been just over 1 minute. My wife called 911 and I was starting to come to while she was wrapping up the call with the dispatcher. I remained seated upright, did not fall over, but was completely unresponsive.  When the EMT&#39;s checked vitals (within 5 minutes of me coming back to awareness), all was normal. Simply a full body cold sweat. It&#39;s now 10pm and I feel no other symptoms. Completely &#34;normal&#34;.

I asked my pharmacy staff to call 911 and attend the patient.  I was attending a patient who was feeling faint after her vaccination.  Staff was in contact with 911 and were attending patient.   His initial blood pressure reading was 138/92. He was sweating profusely.  He was no longer talking.  his next blood pressure reading was higher in the 160&#39;s according to our other pharmacist who was attending him.  The paramedics were here very quickly and took the patient to a local hospital.  I believe the attending pharmacist will also be reporting this.

He went to the waiting room and all of a sudden he told his wife he thought he was going to faint. He did and she got on his lap immediately so he wouldn&#39;t fall. She was tapping his face and talking to him. Others in the waiting room were helping. He punched his wife in the stomach (she is pregnant) but she seemed to be ok as she was trying to get him back to normal. I called 911 and  manager gave him water and ice. The paramedics came and checked him out to make sure he was ok. He was very alert by the time they got here and then they left. He continued to sit for awhile and I asked if his wife would be driving. She said yes. I told him if they needed anything to call us.d

                                                I am experiencing vertigo which I?ve never experienced prior to this shot.  It seems like others are experiencing the same issue around 8 days after the shot.   I?m not sure if these individuals have reported this but I have provided a forum where people are reporting this same issue.    The vertigo was so intense on Monday 3/8/2021 at around 4:30am that I ended up getting sick and throwing up.  Symptoms are still around today 3/10/2021 but not as severe.

                                                Vertigo / dizziness about 22 hours after first dose. Extreme nausea and vomiting for following 24 hours. Chills, sweating, fatigue, and extreme dizziness.  Went to urgent care where they prescribed Meclizine and Zofran. Vertigo is still occurring nearly a week later.

Pain radiating to testicles.  Entire body aching.  Couldn&#39;t find comfortable position to sit/stand/walk.   Worse than any illness I&#39;ve had, but without the brain fog Within next 48 hours: Armpit swollen on right arm (same as vaccine arm).  Pain in head persisting.  Pain behind ears.  Dizzy/lightheaded feeling. Third Day after vaccine: Armpit is still swollen.  Headache persists.  Ache in muscles and joints seem to be re-emerging.  But, overall, I&#39;m fine and can work today. Note: Pollen count high - and I typically do get headaches from pollen - so, headaches could be attributable to pollen, but timing is suspicious.

Later on, balloon-type blisters appeared. later majority of that skin peeled off and new pinkish skin surfaced. The entire feeling was like skin burn after boiling oil spill. I could not drive because hand movement or muscle pressure caused pain, leading to unable to sleep on the left side and let people touch my arm. Still, after the new skin, my arm shows many signs of ugly spots and marks and discoloration. It&#39;s mental trauma going through it. Over the period of 15&#43; days applying Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream helped.

He felt fine, so he walked to the bakery area and spoke with another pt, at the muffins display. He said his arm felt &#34;weird&#34; and said that happened to her, too.  He said he started feeling lightheaded and was leaning against the case.  He said, &#34; I blinked, fell to the ground and next he saw people standing around him.&#34;  He said, no nausea, just lightheaded and he hit the side of his head lightly. Staff helped him into a wheelchair and took him to the office.  I spoke with him in the office and asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital.  I received this information from the patient when I asked him if he could tell me what happened.  He was sweating and pale, but no nausea, no disturbance in his vision and his blood pressure wasn&#39;t elevated.   He told me again that he took no regular medication,  but a couple of years ago he had been dizzy after a tetanus shot.  I asked again if he had any discomfort or pain anywhere and he said only his arm felt sore near the shot.   I asked again if he felt like he would like to go to the hospital and he said no.  His family came and picked him up.

Chills but with a high fever. Threw up 25mins after shot. Immediately after that felt really nauseous and couldn?t see straight. Vision was black and I was seeing stars. Felt like hallucinating really bad. Couldn?t focus my vision. Got home and showered with a really hot shower and immediately started feeling better. 45mins to 1 hour after shot started feeling way better! Just sluggish the rest of the night.  For some reason was fighting going to sleep and fell asleep sitting up. Next day much better!

RPh on duty and front end managers were at the scene, patient was provided with water and offered 911/ambulance for help. Patient denied, stating he &#34;is fine&#34; and wanted to sit down before deciding before calling 911. Per pt, he didn?t think he hit his head when he fainted, but he fell on the side of his temple. RPH on duty observed patient for another 30 minutes until 1:15PM. Per patient, he only had a small breakfast and a kombucha in the morning.

Patient mentioned he was very anxious prior to receiving the shot. Patient doesn&#39;t have any medical history and is not taking any medications or other illicit drugs. Patient lives by himself so he doesn&#39;t have anyone to watch over him when he goes home and at 1:15PM. Patient stated he still feels dizzy, nausea, and arm tingling. Front end manager called 911/Ambulance, medics arrived around 1:20PM. blood glucose, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen were checked. Medics also checked patient?s memory (asked what day it was, what year, who the president is, etc). Medics told patient that he can decide the following options:   1: to have family/friend to come pick him up and take him home OR 2: they can take him to nearby hospital for checkup. Patient lives alone so he decided to go to the hospital to have check up to &#34;make him feel better&#34;.  Patient was transported to the hospital around 1:37 PM. Both RPh on duty and front end managers were at the scene the whole time. Patient seemed to be in full command of his faculties and was following instructions at time of departure.

I gave him some cool water and instructed him to remove his sweater. It was warm in the store so I placed a fan so he could cool off.  He waited about an additional 15 minutes in our consultation room after which time he said he was feeling better and was able to leave the store under his own volition. I tried calling about an hour later but received no response.

About a minute after administering the COVID-19 vaccine the patient reported feeling dizzy. He then passed out in the chair. We safely moved the patient to the floor. Then within approximately 15 seconds the patient sat up and then stood up on his own. We asked the patient to then be seated in the chair while he recovered. We called 911 as soon as he passed out. Patient was somewhat confused initially but quickly regained his bearings. He began sweating and said he was very hot. We checked his blood pressure and it was 100/80. Patient continued to recover and said he was feeling better. We had him wait until EMTs arrived. He told them he did not need any care. We took his blood pressure again and it was now 110/75. He said he felt well to go to the EMTs and pharmacist.

Walking there he fainted but his wife caught him protecting his head. His pulse and breathing were checked and the on-duty pharmacist stayed with him until the EMS arrived. By that time he was able to sit up and drink more water. He was not taken away by ambulance but was evaluated and walked out on his own.

He all of a sudden was thirsty and told mom to grab water and when she was getting the water he became dizzy and fell on the floor from the chair.

                                                I received the Covid 19 Moderna vaccine on 5/14/2021; approximately at 6pm.  I experienced about 5 hours later adverse reactions.  I went to be around 11pm.  Upon laying down I began to get dizzy and my heart began to pound rapidly.  This strong heart pounding would last 5 hours straight. An hour later my throat started to get a tight feeling with tingling under the chin area and my saliva production began to slow drying out my mouth.  Breathing became more labored and difficult.  At this time my heart was still beating strong.  I had intense Insomnia.  The one time that I tried to lay down; when my body would try to doze off for a second; my body would suddenly jolt me awake with an intense shaking and heart pounding.

The numbness and tingling advanced to include his left arm and hand and he found it difficult to make a fist with either hand. Problem continues. Patient did not get the 2nd shot and was advised to contact his MD as soon as possible.

                                                I am a healthy individual with no pre-existing conditions. I had Covid-19 in August of 2020. I was in bed for 5 weeks with most of the symptoms and regularly had fever exceeding 104. When I was allowed to return to work, the Dr. gave me light duty orders to not exceed 5 hours worked per day for 2 months.  After receiving the first vaccination dose, my arm became incredibly sore. These symptoms lasted for almost 2 weeks.   The morning following vaccination, my body began to ache and hurt on touch to the point where the cover woke me up in pain. These symptoms lasted nearly three days during both day and night.   I became nauseous about 24 hours following the vaccination. These symptoms lasted almost 4, 24 hour days.   I became dizzy, periodically, about 24 hours after receiving the vaccination.  These symptoms lasted for almost 7 days.   I had low grade fever on three occasions that I knew about, I treated with Tylenol.  These symptoms lasted 3 days after vaccination.   I had a horrible headache (I never have had headaches before) I could not open my eyes or expose them to light. Most of the pain was concentrated on the left side of my head. These headaches started 3 days after receiving the vaccination and lasted 5 days later until day 8. I used Tylenol, which seemed to have little effect and slept all day.

Called back at 3:11pm; he states he is doing fine. He passed out with the first vaccination as well.

Patient gradually began to regain color and normal speech returned. Patient stated that he was panicked and is afraid of needles and worked him self up after receiving the vaccine.

He walked back the vaccination room. We offered him water, then we checked his vitals at 11:24am (BP 111/62, HR 52 bpm). He took his mask off, took few deep breaths, took more water. Then rechecked his vitals again at 11:31 am (BP 115/79, HR 65 bpm). He said that he started feeling better and less sweaty. Per patient, he had a bagel, a Redbull and smoked marijuana few hours before the vaccine. He was nervous about getting the second dose and the possible side effects that he heard about. Patient left the pharmacy around 11:35am with his wife and son. His wife mentioned that she will be driving him home. Patient was counseled to seek medical help if he experience more adverse effects.

We got cold water for the patient to drink and placed some cold water on a towel on the back of his head. We then checked his blood pressure 117/68 his pulse was 65. We kept an eye on him for the next 30 minutes and he opted to leave because he said he was feeling a lot better and lived very close by. Patient ate lunch by 1 pm. We took his information to follow up and counseled him to lay down and get something to eat. He was instructed to call the pharmacy if he had any concerns or questions.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                At about 10 minutes post injection I began feeling dizzy, lightheaded and hot. Left arm began itching. Discovered hives on my upper arm. 15 minutes later hives had spread to my left shoulder and neck. Paramedics on site gave me a fimotadine tablet and a benedryl injection, juice, water and monitored me. 20 minutes later there was no improvement, they gave another benedryl injection. Dizziness persisted. Hives began to resolve. 40 minutes later they permitted me to leave but said I could not drive, because the dizziness persisted. Advised me to take a benedryl tablet by mouth before bed and again in the morning and to follow up with my PCP.

                                                Gave patient shot. He left the vaccination room. A few minutes later he tells me he is dizzy and his vision is blurry so I bring him back into the vaccination room, give him some water and tell him to relax. 10 minutes later I check his BP which is elevated along with his pulse. I check again another 10 minutes later and it has lowered (pulse 80). BP still elevated so I mentioned it could be due to the nervousness to the reaction or just that he has hypertension and he should get it checked out. After a while his spouse came into the vaccination room and he said he was better and they left.

I was unable to walk by myself the pain was so awful and my legs just felt that heavy! It?s hard to explain the pain almost like a severe ache and throbbing when laying down or sitting but sharp pain when standing or moving. Today day 4 pain is Lessing but still ache, was able to walk on my own on day 3 after the vaccine.

Patient promptly regained consciousness and said that he does not remember falling out of chair and that he feels okay aside from some sweating, anxiety, and lightheadedness, which he attributed to being dehydrated. Patient was not given epinephrine because he promptly regained consciousness and was able to have a conversation with us. 991 was called and paramedics came.

                                                Patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  After 5 minutes of sitting, he decided to walk around the store to shop.  The patient experienced syncope and fell face first to the floor, cutting his lip.  The patient was bleeding from his lips.  Customers and pharmacy technicians tended to the patient.  He was alert and responsive the entire time.  The pharmacist called 911 and an EMS team was dispatched.  The patient rose and sat in a chair.  He was given water.  He stated that he just felt overheated and that the store was very warm.  EMS arrived, evaluated the patient, and stated that the patient just experienced a bout of syncope.  They asked if the patient would like to go to the hospital and the patient declined.  EMS left and the patient remained seated, resting for an additional 20 minutes.  The patient left the pharmacy.  The pharmacist spoke with the patient several hours later and the patient reported he was doing fine at home resting.  The pharmacist counseled the patient to contact his primary care provider regarding the incident.

Approximately 4-5 minutes later, the patient was observed to be slumping in the chair, and fell to the floor. It was not clear whether he hit his head. The patient was incoherent, and was asked to lie on his back. He tried to get up, and was positioned to a sitting position on the floor.  called 911, and conveyed all necessary info. A paramedic who happened to be shopping in the store intervened and tried to make an assessment of the patient. He asked several questions to determine patient awareness,(year, date, president). When Fire &amp; Rescue arrived, they performed a general assessment including cardiac monitoring. After roughly 15 minutes, the patient appeared to have regained his faculties. Although it was strongly suggested that he be transported to the hospital for further observation, the patient declined, and left the store of his own accord with his mother.

I had sudden and intense tightness in the left chest (felt like I was shot) the developed into pain and then numbness/immobility of the left arm (vaccine was administered in the left shoulder area).  Since this point I have had routine soreness/tightness in the chest and constant shortness of breath/wheezing.

Shingles were accompanied by eye irritation, headaches (localized on left side), and light headness.  Treated with Prednisone and Valtrex.

He felt slightly better and upon arriving home the patient had troubles breathing and explained it as a panic attack without actually having any anxiety. The patient consulted with a physician at a local clinic and was instructed to go to the emergency room. I have not had contact with the patient since arriving at the emergency room.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

He was pale/yellow and eyes hard to keep open. Pulse was 75. BP 114/77. Patient indicated on var and when questioned prior to administration that he had no allergies and no problem with any shots in the past. Questioned him again and wife told me that he did have a history of passing out with blood draws. Applied ice packs on head and wrists and got patient flat on floor with feet elevated. Family requested that EMS be called.  Nurse standing in line assisted in monitoring patient until EMS arrived. Blood sugar was 108 and pulse 117/77 taken by EMS. Patient was able to stand for them and refused transport. He remained seated for 20 minutes longer after they left. He was able to stand without symptoms and said he felt fine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  mild fever and extreme shivering was preceded by slight feeling of physical exhaustion, and perhaps exacerbated or triggered by brushing teeth and washing hands in cold water and urinating (very slight body temperature drop), which evolved into almost-teeth-chattered uncontrollable shivers for 1&#43; hr and an extremely slow increase to 101-102 degree fever over the next three hours. Patient took a full dose Advil (ibuprofen) which seemed to relieve symptoms after perhaps 4&#43; hours of sleep. Patient was physically unable to meaningfully move or reposition themselves in bed for 1-2 hours due to exhaustion, but could have perhaps done so if roused by necessity.

Patient was then helped to the floor to lay down. We placed something under his head to make him more comfortable and then proceeded to elevate his feet. He remained laying down for about 5 minutes. Then the sweating stopped and he was no longer dizzy or pale.  We returned him to the sitting position for another 10 mins and then helped him test standing at which point he said he felt better and would like to go shopping. I walked around with him for about 5 minutes to make sure he continued to feel ok.

                                                I woke up the next morning feeling a general muscle soreness throughout my body.  I was also experiencing mild chills and mild dizziness.  I took a 1000mg dose of acetaminophen and a 400mg dose of ibuprofen about an hour after I got up and rested for several hours.  The symptoms started to dissipate at around 1pm but the soreness slightly persisted throughout the day.  Symptoms were gone the next day.

I reassured him that it was a good time to get this vaccine due to the pandemic and tried to keep in good spirits; he appeared a little nervous. After the vaccine, he stood up and walked over to our waiting area. He walked regularly and sat down. Patient was sitting for a few minutes before the pharmacy technician saw him &#34;slide&#34; down his chair and onto the floor. Patient was unconscious but easily arousable. Regained consciousness after a few seconds. Patient was still breathing and had a pulse. After patient regained consciousness, he said he has a history of passing out after getting his blood drawn/getting a vaccine.

                                                Starting the day of the vaccine in the evening, I had fever, felt tired and chills. Temperature 101-102 . I  took ibuprofen and went to sleep. I had chills the whole night. I woke up the next day and had headache, dizzy, nauseated. I continued to take ibuprofen every 4 hours.  Mild fever during the day and no fever at night. Nausea was improving.  Headache was not improving. The following day, I felt a little better, a little nauseated, headache, dizziness and diarrhea and left work early to go home. Took Zofran for dizziness and it helped a little. I did a telehealth visit over the phone and I was sent to get Covid test (negative).  Symptoms did not improve so I went to ER the follow day.  I was sent home with a prescription for higher dose Zofran and was told to stop ibuprofen and start Tylenol.   I went home and tried to rest.  Symptoms are slowly improving.  I was unable to drive for a whole week.  I had these symptoms for about 7 days. Headache, diarrhea and nausea went away, but I still felt fatigued.   The fatigue lasted for about another week (total of 2 weeks).

                                                After five days from the second dose of Moderna Covid Vaccine, I started to have vertigo, dizziness and lightheadedness and pressure on my ears. It is worse when I walk or turn my haead; I am at the day 13 today from the vaccine secon dose, and still have those feelings without any improvement. This has made me unfunctional and unable to walk or do my daily activities. I went to my neurologist 2 days ago and she found nothing wrong with my tests. She finally prescribed otc medication: &#34;meclizine&#34; that has not helped me much. I saw a lot of people are experiencing the same issue, dizziness and vertigo ;Please see thsi forum which shows I am not the only one. /

I lost all control of my body and fell over, convulsing for an unknown amount of time.  I apparently foamed and/or drooled all over myself.  I woke out of this effect around 3:30 AM.  This was Friday/Saturday.  Its Monday now.  I still cannot stand straight and cannot create complex thoughts in my mind.  I had a hard time perceiving colors for the first day and a half to two days after the seizure or stroke I suffered.  I still have a migraine that feels like an elephant is sitting inside my skull.  I still cannot perform complicated thoughts nor can I do complicated things with my hands because of a lack of motor skills.  I successfully pulled every muscle in my back and neck and cannot stand upright.  I&#39;m 35 and now need a cane.  Its already been 3 days and things really have not changed.  Won&#39;t catch me lining up for a booster shot.  NO THANK YOU.  I did not seek medical attention because lets face it the healthcare system is a joke I would have needed a ride to a hospital, increasing my odds of getting the virus, to have them hold me as long as they can to stab me and poke me and take samples, give me no results, and a humungo bill.  I will die before I go to a hospital ever again because the amounts of testing I required at the time would have covered back and neck and brain scans of various types and those tests are stupid expensive and 99% of the time I&#39;ve ever got one they said oh I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong go see my friend who is a specialist blah blah blah and its the &#34;doctor-go-round&#34; where you blow all your money on morons that only care about lining their pockets.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I felt completely fine, just the regular sore arm. Two days later I thought I was getting bit  by mosquitos because I was experiencing hives, I even had to call the health department to take car of the mosquitos but that wasn&#39;t the case at all, because they were hives and not mosquito bites. I was also receiving heat flashes throughout the night and that is still going on until this day. I was prescribed Prednisone 20mg 3 times a day for four days by my PCP and I did not see any changes for the random hives that I was experiencing throughout the day. Another problem that I have been experiencing was being dizzy at random times as well. I was advised by my PCP to go to the dermatologist to receive an allergy test but haven&#39;t been able to get around too it.

                                                After receiving the first dose I went through the typical symptoms that were mentioned.  I had muscle aches, tiredness, and soreness.  That lasted about a day and was back to normal in two days.  On the 5th day after getting my shot I woke up to extreme pain in my left shoulder (dose 1 injection site).  I could pinpoint exactly where the needle must have gone in, because that area was the most painful.  I had full mobility of the shoulder but moving it would increase the pain substantially.  This extreme pain lasted about two weeks.  It took about a month for the constant pain to go away.  I now experience days where I can feel tightness and light pain in the shoulder at the point of injection.  It is nothing serious and usually goes away overnight.  This occurs at least once every few weeks.

                                                Three weeks after receiving the first dose (on 02/01/2021) I woke up with extreme dizziness and imbalance, I felt as if I was constantly leaning to the right.  I would get extremely nauseous from walking, working, or just sitting and turning my head.  When I would lay down on my right side I felt as if fluid were building up and that something was going to pop.  Advil, caffeine, and alcohol made my symptoms worse.  I was able to find some relief by laying down on my left side and through sleep.   After a week, I went to see Dr. at Clinic. They were unable to figure my issue, but they ruled out BPPV.  They also did a blood and urine test at this time. After two weeks the dizziness started to fade a little, but I was left with headaches, imbalance, tiredness, and pressure behind my ear and eye.  I noticed that any kind of stress or anger would make the symptoms much worse.  I visited Dr. at ENT Clinic.  She did several tests and was unable to find any obvious cases of my symptoms.  She suggested I might have had migraines, even though I had no history of them.  She told me to give it a month and come back if I was still having problems. After one Month the dizziness was pretty much gone, but I still was experiencing imbalance, headaches, and pressure.  Instead of getting dizzy I would get sharp shooting headaches that would last a couple of seconds.  I still had what felt like pressure behind my eye and ear.  I also still was unable to lay on my right side.  I visited ENT Dr. again and we decided to do an MRI with contrast.  The MRI came back negative.  We decided to start me on vestibular physical therapy. After 3 months I have gotten to the point where I do not feel imbalance every day.  I still will have days where I feel like I am leaning to the right, but those are getting less frequent.  I still occasionally get headaches, tightness, and fullness in the area.  I would say I am about 75 percent better. I feel what happened in my head is somehow the same reaction I had in my left arm.  I reported this reaction in a different report.  I would like to point out that both times these reactions occurred I drank alcohol the night before.

Symptoms resolve completely after approximately 1 week.

                                                Patient developed sudden onset vertigo with recurrent vomiting. He was brought to the emergency department and was evaluated under the stroke protocol and underwent CT, CTA, and MRI of the brain which did not reveal an etiology of his symptoms. He had a neurology consultation and the most likely cause was thought to be vestibular neuritis on the left side. He was treated with Zofran, Reglan, Meclizine, IV fluids, and Valium with partial relief and was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Symptoms are unresolved at the time of this report.

                                                Felt fine until about nine hours after the shot. Had been sitting at computer for at least six hours straight (and probably smoking more pot than I should have), felt dizzy and short of breath, got up, ended up losing consciousness on the living room floor. Woke up a few minutes later and put myself to bed; felt fatigue, aches, chills, and like I might have been running a mild fever. Slept unusually well; woke up this morning feeling perfectly fine. Not particularly concerned but felt like I should report it.

                                                Woke up on Friday morning (3/5) with severe neck pain and vertigo. Tried to walk to bathroom and was falling over to the right side and felt very nauseous. Starting throwing up. Arrived at ER around9:30AM and was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged a few hours later. He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

                                                Sinus pressure started the same night as the vaccine. The symptoms gradually worsened throughout the night. He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses.

                                                Initial side effects (24 hours) soreness in upper arm. Within 36 hours I started getting extreme light headed. Within 3 days I started having pins and needle sensation in my right arm, from my shoulder to my finger, mainly my pinky and ring finger. I progressed to my left arm and right leg.  I&#39;ve had back pain since then but not sure if it&#39;s related. The pins an needles I feel every now and then but not as bad. The light headedness has not gone away, I can&#39;t shake it.  I&#39;ve seen my Dr, he put me on an anxiety medication.  My blood work came out good. I started the anxiety meds and started seeing a Therapist , but I don&#39;t really see a difference, it&#39;s nice to see someone but not getting better. I&#39;m coming off the anxiety med because a side effect is light headedness and that&#39;s not helping me much.  I have not got the second dose and do not plan on getting it.

Entire body was weak and fatigued.  48 hours everything seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.  Roughly 80 hours later from the vaccination, suddenly body cramped up and had trouble speaking and pronouncing words. Fell to the ground and had hand spasms similar to bells palsy or cerebral palsy. Could not speak fluently or get up on my own. After 45 minutes to 1 hour, when paramedics were called and came they sat me up. Within a few minutes, like a switch, I could speak normally again and could walk on my own. Walked out to the ambulance and waited for 15 minutes or so, and everything seemed fine and back to &#39;normal&#39;. Declined to go to hospital, and since that episode things are still &#39;normal&#39;.

                                                Patient had flu-like symptoms while deployed at start of pandemic (approx. Jan/Feb 2020), but testing was unavailable. His symptoms (URI-like) completely resolved. He received Moderna dose 1 on 02 Feb 2021 without incident, and Moderna dose 2 on 02 Mar 2021. Approximately one week later, he developed mild, dull, diffuse chest pain and shortness of breath which has persisted since.   He was seen in clinic for chest pain and dyspnea on 15 Mar 2021. Patient noted his chest hurt ?all over? especially with deep or with normal inspiration. Reclining, laying down, and sleeping on his right side increased his pain (he did not trial sleeping on his left). Leaning forward decreased pain. He endorsed feeling short of breath, and stated he felt light headed twice while going up stairs, without passing out. He denied recent illnesses and other symptoms. He is a very physically fit Active Duty Marine, who has continued running despite his symptoms. During this encounter and later f/u encounter, he expressed he did not believe running made his symptoms significantly worse.  Vital signs were within normal range and he did not appear in distress. Cardiac and lung exam were normal, and no friction rub or murmur was appreciated. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with HR consistent with his known, athletic-type normal variant heart rate. No other abnormalities were detected. Due to limited ancillary services within clinic, he was sent to USNHO ED for evaluation. There, he had basic labs (including Trop I) drawn, which were normal. EKG and portable chest xray were also unremarkable, and he was discharged with Motrin 800mg PO TID.  He was seen in clinic again 29 Mar 2021 for continued, unchanged symptoms, and reported he had been taking his Motrin only in the mornings and afternoons. Vital signs were unchanged (normal limits). Exam, including heart and lung, were normal. EKG again demonstrated sinus bradycardia, consistent with his normal resting heart rate. He was started on empiric therapy for pericarditis. He was released from clinic and will follow up in several weeks.

The pharmacist patted his shoulder and said his name to try to get his attention.  The patient&#39;s forearms turned red, and he was breathing heavily but then the pharmacist couldn&#39;t hear his breathing for a couple of seconds, after that the patient took a deep breath and his forearms started turning back to normal color, but his face was very pale.  All took place in less than 2 minutes.  The pharmacist gave him a bottle of water and he waited in the pharmacy for a total of 30-35 minutes.

                                                Within one minute of receiving the shot I felt disoriented and had trouble determining if I had buttoned my shirt correctly. For the next two and half hours I had trouble recalling basic things that I should have been observing such as which highway my driver had taken me home on although I knew where I was at.   I also experienced irregular breathing. To be specific, I would take a very large breath, a very short breath, or miss a breath. This started as a series of one to three irregular breaths every five minutes or so. My breaths became more irregular in the next hour. While driving to my employers office about fifteen or twenty minutes after my shot, my right eye closed and I could not open it for about seven seconds. My breathing also became deep and the pace was not under my control. Once at the office I sat in my manager&#39;s office to be observed. I experienced more intense episodes of the above listed symptoms such as both eyes closing and the left one watering. The watering continued into the next day periodically. At least two times while my eyes closed I had to put my elbow on the desk and my hand on my head to make sure I didn&#39;t fall out of the chair. I also felt very uncomfortable causing me to moan. This happened one time.   After this my manager called my parents and they came to take me home. It took them one hour to get there. While waiting I felt light headed and the breathing irregularities became less intense. When they got there I mainly felt disoriented. The disorientation could be best described as slightly impaired or slowed decision making.   I would also like to know if I should receive the second vaccination.

He stood up and walked to pharmacy counter to inform pharmacy staff he was not feeling well, that he was having chills and felt dizzy. A pharmacist was called to check on the patient, as the pharmacist reached to patient to ask about his symptoms, the patient started to fall. The pharmacist caught the patient from behind and gently sat him down. A second pharmacist was called while another technician dialed EMS. EMS arrived to evaluate patient and determined he was dehydrated. They offered to take patient to ambulance to give him IV fluids, the patient declined. Stated he was fine, gave his statement and was able to walk out on his own power.

I had to lay down for about 5 minutes before I started feeling any sort of normal.  Just about everyday since the Shot I have had a a high pitched ringing that comes and goes and a sever migraine that does not change if I take any medication (Advil). the only way to feel better is to sleep. yesterday was the worst yet.  when I contacted my pharmacist that administered the vaccine they informed me that they did not report my initial side effects and only after I called today were they going to report them.

                                                After patient received his shot, while sitting during the 15 min waiting period. The patient began getting lightheaded and hot, his color went out of him and his eyes began rolling back in his head.  His eyelids turned a purple color and he appeared to momentarily stop breathing.  Myself and another pharmacist got him on the ground and supported his head with a coat.  When he &#34;came to&#34; and was talking to us.  He described feeling better on the cold floor and his color began coming back.   I was speaking with him the entire time.  While we were out with his 9-1-1 was called and paramedics arrived 15 min later.  by the time paramedics had arrived the patient had gotten up and back into the chair himself, was lucid and had color back in his face.  Paramedics arrived and took over.  He was given the green light from them and remained in the pharmacy area for a total of about 30 minutes before heading home. The patient was admittedly nervous for the shot and had not eaten or had anything to drink the whole day to that point. I believe he passed out from a variety of factors not related to the actual ingredients in the vaccine but cannot confirm this.

                                                Approximately 2 minutes after administration of the vaccine, patient stated he was feeling light-headed, tingling sensation in fingers and beginning to sweat. He was instructed to sit back down, stay for a total of 30 minutes and let the pharmacist know if his condition worsens (his mother was with him). I, asked a technician to provide him with a bottle of cold water. After 4 to 5 minutes, his mother notified me his condition had worsened and the patient looked pale and sweat was visible on his forehead. Another pharmacist stepped in to assist because I was with a different patient. This pharmacist, aligned 3 to 4 chairs so the patient could lie down. He stayed with him until he stated he felt better, which was approximately 5 minutes later. For the record, the patient did not mention a headache or symptoms of a migraine. Patient called pharmacy on 4/14/21 and stated he&#39;s been suffering from a headache/migraine since the day of administration. The pharmacist recommended to follow up with PCP.

                                                I believe I experienced multiple symptoms as a result of my vaccine. My experience matches exactly as described in the article.  ON 4/1/21 at approximately 4pm I awoke from a nap experiencing acute vertigo, nausea and headache. I also was experiencing fever and chills. I began treating with excedrine but did not have an effect. The vertigo was very acute, my eyes were skipping and I was unable to walk. Nause was so intense that any attempt to leave my bed resulted in vomiting. I was unable to eat and could barely drink for the first 24 hours. Friday 4/2 at approx 7pm I took a dose of Promethazine which began to help the nausea. Extreme headache/migraine lasted for 3 days. During this time I also experienced extreme neck pain, as well as pain near base of skull, behind my ears, and on my temples. Symptoms were steadily improving each day, so I did not seek medical care during this time. I feel I became fully recovered by 4/18. I just had my second vaccine dose on 4/21 and I am very nervous about experiencing a relapse of symptoms.

                                                First I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to light, I was also feeling light headed and dizzy on my walk back to the car. (about 30 minutes after injection). I had someone else drive because I felt like I could not drive in my condition. On the ride home, about 40 minutes after injection, I began to have an increased heart rate and had a hard time swallowing. It was also slightly difficult to breathe. I felt like my head was cloudy and I had a hard time concentrating. I felt like my brain was responding about a half a second slower to what I saw. Like if I wanted to turn my head, I would think try to turn my head and my body would react a second later. When I got home, about 1 hour after the injection, my girlfriend told me my hands were freezing cold. I was also having a hard time walking in straight because I was so dizzy. I was still having some minor trouble breathing and swallowing. It was difficult to drink water. After about 2 hours my breathing returned to normal. My mind was cloudy all day, I felt like I was drunk.  On the second day, I woke up with an intense headache. It lasted for 3 days. My arm started to hurt on the second day as well, no pain at all the first day. My head was still cloudy and I had difficulty trying to recall memories or answer questions. By the third day this was basically gone. I was extremely tired for three days total. My mind remain cloudy for about a week.

                                                I got the shot around 3:15PM on Monday 4/26/21. Woke up Tuesday 4/27/21 with a minor headache and just felt out of sorts. Around noon that day I had a seizure at work and was rushed to the ER. While at the hospital waiting for a room to open up, I had another seizure. This one was much worse than the first. They had to intubate me and I spent 5 nights in the ICU. Another 3 on the Neurology floor for observation. The seizures caused Rhabdomyolysis which caused damage to my kidneys and significant muscle loss/damage. I wasn&#39;t able to walk at all for 3 days. After that I started to be able to get up out of bed and move around a little more each day.

                                                Dizziness, unbalance. Vertigo was there occasionally the first couple days for hours or minutes, continues endlessly for now. I had a case of vertigo 8 or 9 years ago but no issues ever again with the ear or hearing or balance. After the first shot I twice thought I had a blockage or something in the ear. Tried drops, wax remover whatever you can find, nothing helped. Eventually it subsided but never gave real vertigo or long lasting balance issue. After 2nd shot was immediately an issue. Constant sweating and 99.5 fever for the 11th, 12th and 13th. 3 days straight of just sweating. Vomiting on around or just after midnight on the 13th, into the morning of the 14th. End of the 14th leading to the 15th the Veritgo has a light migraine attached. The migraine is mostly in the right eye has any migraine I&#39;ve had is, comes with some light nasal pressure right at the eye socket. No issues with nasal drip or stuffy nose. Slight blurred vision which either creates the migraine or is from it. I also had migraines in the past but no more than 1 a year for the last 5 years, nothing I have medication or treatment for any longer.  This vertigo has a low grade migraine with small dot of blurred vision from one eye, my right eye. I dance with my daughter which is usually holding hands and spinning until her feet come off the ground. The first recognition that something is terribly wrong in my ear was that the moment I spin I can&#39;t rotate more than once rapidly without becoming incredibly unstably dizzy. That regardless of the vertigo, migraine or anything has been true since the 2nd shot when I spin I am at a total loss of balance.  There is constant dizziness, blurred vision, migraine

Initial blood pressure was &lt;80/60, which recovered to normal within 20 minutes. During that period, experienced shortness of breath / gasping (though 1st responders noted clear airways and no wheezing in lungs), nausea (did not vomit), and disorientation / dizziness.

                                                I have had plenty of vaccines in the past, but this was administered EXTREMELY high up on the shoulder.  The pain in my left shoulder started around 3-5 days after the vaccine. I assumed that I had simply slept on it wrong and did not initially consider that my pain might be vaccine related. I have extreme loss of mobility in my left shoulder and it is extremely painful to move my shoulder in any direction. Pain or mobility are not improving with stretches recommended by physical therapist.

                                                3 days after I received my 2nd dose of Moderna Vaccine at the same facility (Which I received on 4/16/2021), I&#39;ve had a series of what could be panic attacks.  1 on 4/19/21, 1 on 4/30/21, then another on 5/8/21, which then continues to stay with me on a milder intensity, but is lasting still today.   In my previous 4 years of working, I&#39;ve only missed a less than a 1 handful of days of work due to health conditions, but suddenly after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine, I&#39;ve had a myriad of what I initially thought were heart attacks where I was unable to drive to work (had to pull over twice on the road due to serious risk of being in an accident / having unprovoked panic attacks the morning of  4/19/21 and 5/8/21).  Had extreme SOB and could seriously considered calling 911 on all 3 of my first episodes.  Went to Urgent Care on 5/10/21, and have had several phone visits with my primary care physician since then and was placed on medical leave until 5/22/21, although I still am experience some side effects even today.

Body aches build over the night. Wake up with mild/moderate pain in back, knees, arm. Groggy. Went to work on something with a friend at 10:00 AM (T&#43;24Hrs), but had to return home because....  T&#43;24hr: ....headache growing. Went home and found fever at 102°.  Slight chills, bit mainly just heat without sweating. Fever hit 103.2 at peak. Went through 10lbs ice to keep the fever in check. Headache from T24hr-T36HR feels like a spike through the top of frontal lobe to my left eye.  T&#43;32hr: Headache still intense. Only back pain now. Appetite slowly increasing.  T&#43;48hr (Saturday morning). Back pain persists, but mild. Headache gone. Have a relatively normal day.  T&#43;60hrs (Sat. Afternoon): Back pain increasing. Stop all unnecessary lifting/moving.  T&#43;68hrs (early Sunday morning): Go to ER with the back pain. Absolutely excruciating spasms from top of sacrum - roughly LI/12T. Lower back stiff as wood. Given shot or Toradol, dose/prescription to flexiril. I specifically request this plan because usually takes care of the spasms; basically, get me able to move and the pain/spasms will go away.   NOTE: I have a history of back issues in this area, but I have not had an episode in years and certainly never had an episode that works like this with no relief. From about 2017-2019, I r  T&#43;70-78hrs: Feel normal.  T &#43; 78-88hrs: lower back pain comes back with an absolute vengeance.  T&#43;90hrs (early Monday morning): Return to ER. Back pain worse than Sunday morning. Receive toradol shot and prescription Prednisone. Back pain gone by around 10:30 AM. Decide to take prednisone Tuesday morning as its getting a bit late in the day by the time pharmacy fills the prescription.   T&#43;90hrs: Back pain returns in similar fashion as Sunday afternoon. Still. Barely mobile.   T&#43;96 hours: Wake up with lower back pain similar to Sunday/Monday morning. Took prednisone and flexiril this morning.   Please help me.

Pain is elicited on palpation (no induration felt today) and with certain movements (lifting of arm and abduction).  He relates this specifically to the vaccine administration site.  He said that he had only experienced soreness at the administration sites immediately following the vaccinations until now.  He also has had numbness involving what appears to be the medial nerve (just one time in last week) and strange sensation down at the elbow/AC area.  Advised to F/U with PCP from health system return to work coordinator if employee feels he needs medical treatment .  This was communicated to employee and it is unknown at this time if employee has sought medical care.

                                                After I was vaccinated, I didn&#39;t have any initial symptoms and then about thirty minutes after my right shoulder was throbbing and I felt very dizzy. An EMT that was at the vaccination site checked my BP and pulse and monitored me and suggested I go home and rest. She said not to take Tylenol unless I absolutely needed it. When I got home I felt absolutely tired and exhausted. By 6:00PM I was developing a low grade fever. I went to the ER at 5/29/2021 at 7:00PM. My temp was 101.5 so I went and got checked out at the ER. The diagnosis was elevated procalcitonin and they ordered a number of labs as well. They also said it was a post vaccination reaction. They gave me about a 1,000 MG of Tylenol and a liter of fluids. I was at the ER for about 3 hours. I also had swelling and rash around the injection site, a raised rash which almost looked like a burn to me it was about 3 inches. I felt tired and weak for about a week to so following this. Another thing that started was vertigo and migraines, but I was suspected of having Covid twice so DRs do not know and it is hard to sat what that is in regards to. I may have had Covid in March 2020 and Feb 2021, I was unable to get tested but the first time it lasted about 6 weeks and the second time was more mild.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

My wife helped me downstairs and after some water and Tylenol, symptoms reversed themselves in about 15 minutes.  My body temperature was not recognized by the thermometer and then registered 93.4

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA Approximately 3 hours after vaccine, shoulder pain began to develop. Pain became significant, waking me in the middle of the night. The following day, I was unable to lift the arm I received the injection in no higher than about 80 degrees from my side. Pain increased despite taking OTC NSAIDS. By the second morning after vaccine administration, pain had worsened and right arm cannot be raised more than about 60 degrees without significant pain. Contacted PCP office about 12 hours after injection, they recommended NSAID dosages alternating ibuprofen and tylenol, and icing the shoulder. Pain impacts daily life activities, including caring for small children , lifting items that weigh more than a few pounds by the impacted arm, and significant difficulty reaching any object above the level of the shoulder. I have never previously experienced this kind of reaction to any other upper arm injection or vaccination.

At 5 pm I had fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain, as well as dizziness. By 5:30 my condition worsened, and I have a fast heartbeat, significant dizziness, and chills. At 5:40 I contacted my wife to leave work to drive me to the hospital. We arrived at the hospital around 6:15; by 8 pm most symptoms except dizziness had disappeared. By 9 pm the dizziness had abated. It is 10:40 pm and I am still a little dizzy, but able to move and operate fine.

Pharmacist asked for other possible reactions: tingling, itchy skin, rash, difficulty swallowing or swelling of lips. Patient denied all those reactions  stating that he only felt &#34;a little dizzy.&#34; He decided that he would sit for 10-15 more minutes to &#34;wait it out.&#34; Patient was given water to sip while seated for the extra time. After about 10 minutes he was able to walk without feeling dizzy and reported to the pharmacist that he was well. Pharmacist advised him to log onto the V-Safe site to report his reactions and to review the Moderna EUA.

I called 911 as soon as he began to lose consciousness and while I was on he phone with 911, he regained consciousness and had color in his face again and felt much better. EMS and the firefighters checked him out and all of his vitals were normal and he could walk upright just fine.

                                                patient received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. After receiving in our immunization room, he left the room and then shortly walked over to the pharmacy in-window and told the pharmacy tech that he did not feel well and felt dizzy. Tech had him go sit down in the waiting room and went and got the nurse, who went out to check on patient. Patient was slumped in the waiting room chair with eyes closed and very sweaty. Patient said he wanted water, so staff quickly got him water. After a few sips, patient&#39;s head rolled back and he lost consciousness for roughly 10 seconds before waking up startled and confused. Ambulance was already called and when the arrived they triaged the patient for around 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes the patient seemed much better and the paramedics decided it was OK for him to leave and drive himself home.

                                                Patient had dark circles under their eyes and did discuss at the drop off window they had a needle phobia. Immediately after the immunization, he said he felt lightheaded. I, pharmacist, sat in the booth and talked to him for a couple minutes then asked if he felt he could finish his observation outside the booth.  I notified technician to hand him off to her for observation , sharing by observation that the patient did not look well but he said he was doing a little better. He said he felt better and he did wait in the chairs outside the immunization booth. While I was in the pharmacy discussing this information with my pharmacy technician when I heard yelling and I stepped back out of the pharmacy to observe the patient was sliding out of his chair, stiff straight. My other technician came to my assistance and we both tried to get him to the floor and he was making incoherent noises and his arm was bent behind him and not relaxing to where we could get him to the floor. He then came to and startled a bit, with a bewildered look on his face. He asked what happened and said he felt he was dreaming.  A witness waiting on her prescriptions for pickup said that it originally appeared he was having a seizure which was my concern as well. We called code white and 911 and store manager assisted us at the scene. Patient denied the ambulance.

                                                Shoulder/neck pain four days after second vaccine. Shoulder joint feels like something is torn, inflamed, or hyper-extended on side of injection. Neck feels like a muscle is pulled, strained, or otherwise tense. Movement was limited initially, similar to sciatica, but regular neck stretches and shoulder massages have increased mobility but not decreased pain.

All of these symptoms subsided  within approximately 36 hrs. after time of vaccination with plenty of rest.

He sustained a laceration above one eyebrow that required stitches to be placed.  He was assessed by a medic on site, vitals taken, and oxygen administered.  His blood sugar was in the 70s.  Patient admitted to fear of needles, not eating much all day, and hx of similar episode after receiving an IM injection of a muscle relaxant about 10 yrs ago.

I would rate the pain when I pushed on the injection site at 6/10. It was only painful when I touched it or tried to use the muscle to lift my arm in certain ways. I also experienced some level of fatigue and slight dizziness the day after I received my shot.

He was informed that  there are more chances of side effects experienced with the second dose ( such as headaches, flu like symptoms, nausea).  He was directed to stay in the store for at least 15 minutes and to inform the pharmacy immediately if he felt anything  out of the ordinary.  He said he walked down several aisles then started feeling light headed and having tunnel vision.  He was on his way back to the pharmacy when he ended up on the ground.  He does not remember how he ended up laying on the ground.  He said his head did not hurt but does not know if he hit it.  When started regaining conscience, his right arm and leg jerked somewhat then calmed down.  When he came to, he said he didn&#39;t feel dizzy when he tried to sit up.  The ambulance was called so he was instructed to remain laying on the floor.  The EMT personnel asked him his name, the date, and where he was while he was laying down and after sitting up on the floor.  He answered correctly both times.  He was then asked to sit down on a chair to take his blood pressure.  The EMT personnel were having trouble   getting a good reading so he was transported to Hospital.

We had him sit down and then he passed out.

EMT services were called while this was happening.

                                                This morning I gave a patient a moderna vaccine. During administration the patient expressed his fear of needles. After the vaccine I asked the patient to have a seat and wait in the waiting area for 15 minutes. He went and sat down for just a couple minutes and stood up to look for his spouse and when he stood up he passed out and hit the floor face first. I ran out there to check on him and he was unresponsive and bleeding a lot. My team immediately called 911. I started tapping him and slightly shaking him and after a few minutes he woke up. He told me the only thing he remembers is feeling dizzy then woke up on the floor. EMS showed up a few minutes later and took the patient to the hospital.

                                                The side effects I&#39;m experiencing didn&#39;t start until about 2 days later.  It started out as pain at the injection site with extremely bad dizziness that has gotten worse each day. On day 4 after the injection I noticed a full pain in my left thumb area. The same side as the injection. I didn&#39;t think anything of it but as the hour&#39;s and days went by it continued and continues to get worse. The best way I could explain it is it feels like when your hand falls asleep without the pins and needles. Yesterday I ended up having to go to the ER. My issue with my left thumb area started to get much worse. I couldn&#39;t hold things in my left hand and started to radiate up my arm. It was the weirdest feeling I can&#39;t really explain it other than being slightly numb and very week. I wasn&#39;t able to move my hand much at all. They gave me a cat scan but they never called me back to be seen or to give me my results. I was there for 8 hours and was never called back to be seen. I had to leave this morning before I was seen because I didn&#39;t have anyone to watch son. Today is 8 days since I received my first covid shot and I still have major fatigue along with dizziness. I will start sweating profusely out of nowhere and then stops.  I&#39;ve had a numb/metallic taste in my mouth for about 4-5 days as well. I feel like I&#39;m in a complete fog and can&#39;t shake this feeling. I&#39;m having trouble concentrating and remembering things. I&#39;m drinking lots of water and trying to rest when I can but I&#39;m still feeling terrible with no signs of this getting better. My doctor suggested I report this to you and I&#39;m hoping and praying this goes away. Is there anything I can do or a specialist I could see? Thank you so much in advance.

                                                Approximately 3- 5 minutes after felt strange mild sensation as if pins and needles was moving throughout my body from the injection site. I also started to breathe differently. Couldn&#39;t tell if my heart rate changed or not.   At about 5 minutes, I started to feel light-headed and nauseous as if I just had blood taken or an IV in my, likely a drop in blood pressure. I was reading a book, put it down on my lap as I couldn&#39;t focus on reading and considering to get help. At that moment, I passed out, hunched over in my chair staring at the floor.   This moment likely lasted for about 1 minute, but felt like 20. I was in a dream like state and at one point had a series of images and/or memories flash by in a sequence. Then, I felt like I was half asleep but couldn&#39;t tell what I was staring at but knew that I had to &#34;wake up&#34;.   Then , I was surrounded by people who helped me up. At this moment I felt very weak and tired and was sweating profusely. My right hand felt very weak.   About 10 minutes later, I started feeling better. I was given water which seemed to help. I would have waves of mild nausea come and go that eventually subsided. I also felt random cramping around my stomach/lower chest area and lower right side rib cage area.   At about 15 -20 minutes felt confident to walk to the bathroom and throughout the store. Eventually, I felt confident to drive safely home.  At the time of writing this (approx 2 hours later), I&#39;m feeling random sensations/feelings of itchyness throughout my body. No sign of hives.

Called the doctor - they treated me for dysphasia - some time of allergic reaction. Prednisone and Benadryl were prescribed. It&#39;s still ongoing - I&#39;m still being evaluated at this time. I am going to see an allergist. I am still having difficulty swallowing - on and off.  (Note: Flu - vaccine - in December 2, 2020 - guessing at which one.)

                                                Minor back pain began on the 21st. Significant discomfort and limitation of mobility by evening of the 22nd. Increasing discomfort throughout the 23rd, such that I could not twist my torso or reach across my body without acute pain. Currently, severe cramping/spasms of muscle groups left of the spine even without attempted motion. It feels as if someone is punching my left lung from the back. There is, however, no numbness or weakness anywhere, no radiating pain, no lung problems or any other issue. Just constant muscle cramps/spasms. May end up visiting a hospital.

Within the next ten minutes  became dizzy then fell out of the chair onto the floor where he struck his nose and eye area on the floor. Patient lost consciousness for about 30 seconds then woke up. Patient had profuse bleeding from the nose and dizziness for 15 minutes.  We had patient sit on the floor and press towels to his head to stop the bleeding. We gave an instant cold pack to patient. We called 911 and requested medical assistance due to the amount of bleeding that patient was experiencing. EMS arrived and took charge of the scene. EMS providers attempted to help the patient to his feet and he fell again. EMS decided to transport the patient to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Loss of consciousness; Dizziness; Hyperhidrosis; Hypoaesthesia; Pallor; This case was received FDA VAERS (Reference number: 1086426) on 18-May-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 18-May-2021.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) in a 37-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Eczema. Concurrent medical conditions included Skin infection (Infection on mid to lower back, possible eczema per patient). Concomitant products included TRIAMCINOLONE for Eczema, CEPHALEXIN [CEFALEXIN] for Skin infection.    On 09-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOAESTHESIA (Hypoaesthesia) and PALLOR (Pallor). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOAESTHESIA (Hypoaesthesia) and PALLOR (Pallor) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 09-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 99 (normal) 99.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The reporter states that the patient received shot and then blacked out a minute or two later. The reporter called 911, and while on the phone the patient regained consciousness and felt much better.  EMS checked him out and all of his vitals were normal and he could walk upright just fine.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, although the events may be associated with the act of being injected rather than with the vaccine itself.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, although the events may be associated with the act of being injected rather than with the vaccine itself

                                                Two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I began to get headaches and sharp pains in my head that would come and go. My lymph nodes behind the back of my head were also sore. I was also very lightheaded and dizzy anytime I would bend over or when I would exercise. Unfortunately it has been over two months now and I am still having these issues almost daily. The sharp pains come and go throughout the day and usual occur in the temple area and one side at a time, and sometimes in the back of the head. The soreness in the lymph nodes behind my head varies day-to-day, and I still have some light-headedness that also varies depending on the day. I had no prior history of any of these conditions.

For the past 7 months, if I do any sort of physical activity or get excited, I get a very debilitating brain fog and headache.  It?s adversely effecting my work and can be dangerous at times.  I?ve had to pull my car off the road on several occasions because the symptoms were so severe.  I?m learning how to cope with the triggers but has definitely decreased my quality of life.  I?m unable to exercise and have to be very careful when doing household chores.

                                                Nausea, lightheadedness, and finally numbness to right side of face, slight drooping on right corner of mouth and right side of bottom lip. It began with a tingling feeling in lip. Observing staff did not notice any swelling, or other impairments, asked me if I had anxiety, and sent me on my way. Shortly after, it felt as if I had gotten a shot at the dentist, and had the tingling numbness left over on the right side of my face. About 4 hours later, my bottom lip and right side of my mouth drooped slightly, but I could still smile, talk, raise my arm, so there was no other impairment. By the next day the numbness had mostly subsided, and the nausea and lightheadedness was gone. This vaccine was given to me at a work clinic in the administration building. I do not have contact information for them but was provided a packet with this website. I don&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions, do not have anxiety, am not a hypochondriac, did not even know about the Bell&#39;s Palsy issues in trials until after I felt numbness, and the right side of my face felt as if it fell asleep, like a foot falling asleep but it was my face. It was not to the extent of Bell&#39;s palsy, and may have even been my bottom lip swelling slightly on the right side that caused the droop. It infuriates me that this side effect was dismissed as me having anxiety because I was nervous that my face was going numb which would be a natural reaction for anyone.

The right side of my bottom lip started tingling about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I had no swelling or other impairment at the time and was released after 40 minutes of observation. A little later the entire right side of my face felt as if it had fallen asleep, approximately 1 hour later and it worsened until about 4 hours later. By the next day the nausea and lightheadedness was gone, and the tingling/numbness to the right side of my face was gone within 48 hours, improving after 24 hours.

                                                Lower Back Spasms just a few hours after vacine was administered.  I went to bed with what I thought was just flu like syptoms like achy muscles.  But this was more then that.  Even laying in bed my back would spasm and almost take my breath away.  That night did not sleep due to the sporadic unpredictable pain when laying in bed.  Describe pain as electic shock or stabbing pain that takes your breath away it&#39;s so intense, but then goes away very quickly.  The next couple of days I was forced to stay immobile due to the pain that was sporadic in nature.  Even when laying down it spasmed.   I could barely walk for a few days.  I started taking NSAIDS to help with the pain and I became more mobile after a few days.  Work has been very difficult and spasms have not gone away even now Im still having problems and am struggling making it through the work day.  I have to lay down flat on my back as soon as I get home from work and take ibuprofen to relieve the pain.  I was absolutely fine healthy and very active person prior to the vaccine.  Just hours after getting vaccine it&#39;s almost like my joints and back were inflamed for some reason.

Reports that after 5-10 min his symptoms improved/resolved, and he has felt fine since. States he is feeling great today.

Patient declined referral, leaning towards not getting the second dose.

                                                I had a MVA on December 19 2000. After physical therapy the pain in my neck was down to a 1. Then after the 2nd dose of moderna about 15 hours after injection I woke up Sunday morning (the next day) and I could barely get out of bed from the pain in my neck. I could not move my neck and the pain was radiating down my left arm. The next day (Monday) I was feeling better and had more movement in my neck but still lots of pain. I went to the PA on Monday and got checked out. I still had strength but mobility was very little. I still have the pain and radiation down arm.

                                                In addition to the (common) side effect of chills and body aches, at around 75 hours after getting the shot I developed extreme gas pains and nausea while running, and barely made it home, collapsing on our floor.  I then suffered severe diarrhea (which had not been listed as a possible side-effect).  It is now five days out, and the diarrhea appears to have abated.  But I continue to have lower abdominal bloating and discomfort.  (I also have painful swollen lymph nodes under the armpit of injection, as I did after the first dose, for at least a week.) Note: These gastrointestinal symptoms are NOT like those I suffer from with gastric dysmotility, which affects my upper GI tract.

                                                Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA). The person administering the vaccine on behalf of CIC Health, whose name I later learned, injected the vaccine too high (roughly level with the acromion process) and far back. Initially there was only a quick burning sensation. The pain started about an hour later, but at that point it was mild and only notable because of the quick onset and slightly different feel from the first dose. Over the next few hours, it intensified and I began to lose the majority of the range of motion in that arm due to excruciating pain. I saw my primary care physician the next morning, he confirmed the positioning of the injection was incorrect. As of writing, ~56 hours after vaccination, the pain and limited range of motion have not yet resolved.

                                                On Friday, April 2nd, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  Within minutes, my heart started racing and I felt faint.  Thereafter, my hands and face got the sensation of tingling.  It felt like ice was running through my veins.  My heart stopped racing approximately fifteen or so minutes after it began.  The tingling sensation in my hands and face ended approximately one hour later.  I also noticed a strange taste in my mouth during this same timeframe.  Subsequently, I had the sensation of being dizzy and lightheaded.  Importantly, I have never reacted to a vaccine in this manner.  On Saturday, April 3rd, I woke up with symptoms that were to be expected.  My arm was very sore and I felt a little achy.  However, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded.    That evening and for the next week or so, my heart was beating rapidly, and my blood pressure was elevated.  I also had the continuous feeling of my skin crawling.  My hands and feet also seemed to be experiencing tremors and twitching.    On Sunday, April 4th, I woke up and noticed that my right eye seemed a little blurry as I read an article on my phone.  I assumed I must have slept on my eye wrong and did not pay it much attention.  I do not recall my eye being blurry for the rest of the day.  The following morning on Monday, April 5th, I woke up once again feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  As I walked to the restroom, I noticed that my right eye was blurry again.  This time it seemed to be more pronounced.  Moreover, when I closed my right eye, I could see hundreds of dots in different colors.  In addition to having blurry vision, my legs felt weak and nearly buckled as I walked.  I felt like I was intoxicated.  Upon returning to bed, my teeth began chattering and I felt like I was freezing.  I called my doctor?s office and spoke with a PA who recommended that I go to the ER.    While I checked in at the ER, I could not remember my ZIP code.  I felt like my brain was not running on all cylinders.  Upon explaining my symptomology to the ER doctor, she recommended that I have my blood drawn and that I get an MRI to rule out a stroke.  All test results came back normal.    On Wednesday, April 7th, I made an appointment with an allergist.  They tested me to see if I was allergic to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polysorbate 80.  For the skin scratch portion of the test, neither of the substances had much of a reaction on my skin.  I thought the Polysorbate 80 scratch had a little bit of redness to it, but it was negligible.  When the doctor injected Polysorbate 80 under my skin with a syringe, a welt formed.  I am not sure why, but PEG was not injected in the same manner.  As a result of the test, the allergist confirmed that I am allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He mentioned that there may be instances of cross reactivity to PEG for individuals that are allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He recommended that I not get the second Moderna dose unless it was administered in a controlled setting.    On Sunday April 11th, I noticed what felt like a hard vein in my abdominal fat.  It felt slightly tender to the touch.  I was fearful that it could be a clot.  On Tuesday, April 13th, I woke up and as a I stood in the shower, my foot was painful to stand on.  On top of my right foot near my ankle, I could visibly see red inflammation in a vein.  I massaged the vein and the redness and pain dissipated.  Being fearful that I did have blood clots, I scheduled an appointment with a PA at my doctor?s office that same day.  We discussed my ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and me being fearful of blood clots.  She had an EKG performed at the office and ordered a barrage of blood tests.  Everything continued to be normal.    On Sunday, April 18th, I again went to the ER, because the hard vein in my stomach became larger and more tender to the touch.  When I bent over, it felt like there was a lot of pressure emanating from the hard vein down to my groin.  Once again, blood was drawn and everything was normal.  I also had an ultrasound performed on the area that felt like a hard vein and the doctor concluded that it was most likely swollen lymph nodes.  I was diagnosed with lymphadenopathy.    On Monday, April 26th, I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss the ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and pain in my stomach and groin area.  He told me that he had seen other patients that were experiencing similar symptoms and that my immune system was possibly overreacting to the vaccine.  He told me the symptoms should go away in time.  He also ordered a new blood test to check for clots.  The D-Dimer test came back normal.    On Tuesday, April 27th, I experienced a painful genital herpes outbreak.  I normally get one every year.  I had just recovered from an infection in December of 2020.  This outbreak was more intense and for the first time I had nerve pain that wrapped around my hip and down my inner thigh.  As of a week later, the infection is almost gone.      Today is May 4th, and I am still experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness.  Some days are better than others and every time I get optimistic that my dizziness and lightheadedness is finally gone, it reappears.  Being an IT consultant business owner and an attorney, I need to think clearly for my profession.  The side effects from the Moderna vaccine have made it very difficult to function.  I would like to get fully vaccinated, but I am fearful of getting the second shot.  I do not want the vaccine to cause permanent neurological damage or worse.    Finally, I am sure your organization is aware, but there are many other people experiencing the same symptoms as me.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 26-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 26-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle) (seriousness criterion medically significant), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement). At the time of the report, SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) was resolving.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications taken by the patient were not provided.  The reporter reported that patient never had any allergic reactions to vaccines or medications before and had no past medical histories for vasovagal reactions. After receiving the vaccine, the patient waited in the pharmacy for 15 minutes - 20 minutes. The patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement. The patient was out of it for 15-30 seconds. The reporter stated that she called 911. The patient came to, his eyes were huge, but he was aware to self and surroundings. The emergency team came, took the patient&#39;s vitals which were stable and stated the patient likely experienced a vasovagal effect from the needle. However, the reporter thinks it was a potential seizure; more than a vasovagal response. Emergency team offered no treatment. The emergency team had encouraged the patient to follow up with a doctor but the patient did not want to make a big scene.  Emergency team offered no treatment for the patient.

                                                The pain in my arm has been severe since a few hours after the second dose shot. Range of motion is extremely limited. Symptoms are not reduced by extra strength Tylenol. Cold compress provides temporary relief of pain, but not increased range of motion.  Pain was less severe at the end of day 4, but has returned to very severe on the morning of day 5.  I am unemployed and uninsured so I have not been able to seek medical care.

                                                The morning after receiving the shot, I woke up at roughly 9am with a High fever (100&#43;), headache, and general felt very sick.  Upon getting up and going to the bathroom, I fainted which peeing (standing up).  Upon waking up on the floor of the bathroom, I got up, was light headed, took 4 steps to the bathroom door, and fainted a second time.  Upon waking up the second time, I made it to bed and fell back asleep until 11:30.   I took my temperature at 11:30 and found it was 99.9 degrees.  I was feeling cooler (less fevered) then I had been at the time of the fainting incident.  I called a nurse through my insurance company, who instructed me to go to the ER.  I waited 3 hours in the ER waiting room, and then received Fluids, A CT head scan, an ECG 12 lead, and blood work.  All normal.  I felt better, if banged up, by the time I left the ER.   I hit my head and Left shoulder in the fall.

                                                3 weeks after initial dose (4/23/2021), I started experiencing dizziness and a constant mild headache. With the dizziness, there was no visual perception of moving or spinning objects and no proprioception problems. The dizziness is more like a sense of being unsteady and an inability to maintain balance. The feeling has never gone away and persists in any position. On different occasions, many times per hour, there is a sweeping feeling that is never in a persistent direction. On the first day of symptoms, the headache was moderate with a feeling of facial puffiness with an elevated blood pressure near hypertensive crisis levels... which was on a Sunday. The following Wednesday morning, I visited the Emergency room at 0034 EST 5/19/2021 because the dizziness was not getting better. A review of systems was performed with no abnormal results. EKG was normal. Cranial CT scan showed no indications of stroke either although I have not looked at it myself yet.  Blood sugar level was at 90. Chem12 test was normal.  Well for more details, please contact me. Session is about to time out and I don&#39;t know how to extend it on my phone.  I have tried vestibular therapy motions. None improved the dizziness. I also have intermittent fog and below normal focus capacity.

He was waiting on a call back from his physician for advisement.  He also states that he was experiencing injection site pain, diarrhea, and stomach pain but experienced these same adverse effects with this first moderna vaccine.

After getting the 2nd dose, I got sick the same way as the first dose. I was very cold and very weak. Thursday and Friday I&#39;m very sick. I felt fine Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, my right arm swelled up so much that it couldn&#39;t handle it&#39;s own weight. The pain got really bad and I had to go back to the dr. I get naproxen sodium to take with Tylenol. Thankfully that worked. My arm still didn&#39;t work until later that Tuesday evening. I would not have been able to make it to the Dr. if I had to drive myself. The doctor called it Moderna arm and said it was something he has seen a lot of. Here is when I find out that something is not right. My mind starts getting trouble. If we went through the same thing in the winter, my heater would not be able to keep the house warm enough. I hear about the booster and I just know I can&#39;t handle it. I am not sure what to do about that.

After about a week I noticed numbness/paresthesias in my fingers and forearms. About a week later it progressed to my face and is now also in my oral cavity (teeth, tongue, and posterior oropharynx). The paresthesias have been accompanied with intermittent mild vertigo, headaches, mild shortness of breath, and palpitations.

Approximately two weeks ago (around 6/27/2021):  Sudden onset of pain in the chest, then heart felt like a clenched fist, then heart started racing.  Couldn&#39;t catch a breath and felt like passing out.  I crawled to my neighbors house and told them to call an ambulance as I thought I was having a heart attack.  While waiting for ambulance, got extreme chills and sweats.  Ambulance came and did EKG which was normal.  Gave me the option to go to hospital, but felt better so I declined.  Since I have gotten the vaccine, I have consistently struggled with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and lightheadedness, to the point where I feel like I&#39;m going to pass out, or die.

Patient was advised to wait for 15 minutes and report to the pharmacy team know if there was any unusual reaction. At 5:40PM , patient informed that he was feeling flushy and he fell down immediately on the floor. I instructed my technician to call 911 immediately. He woke up 30 seconds after falling down and I was there to check on him. We observed him and offered a bottle of water. The 911 team arrived and did a few tests: measured blood pressure reading, collected the heart rate reading, performed the EKG and glucose test. After 20 minutes, patient was alert. He was able to provide answers from the 911 team correctly (his address, the city that he was from, the city that he was at, his full name)  and informed that he was okay to go home. The 911 advised him to have a few sips of Pedialyte and had a small snack. Patient reported that he had not eaten since the morning and had very few liquid.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history information was reported.  Concomitant products included QUETIAPINE FUMARATE (SEROQUEL XR) for an unknown indication.   On 30-Mar-2021 at 1:00 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 27-Apr-2021 at 3:30 PM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 06-May-2021, the patient experienced CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Joint pain that got progrrssively worse and spread from condition aggravated) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain that got progrrssively worse and spread) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MOBILITY DECREASED (could barely move / I could barely get out of bed) and BACK PAIN (pain in the back of knees, every joint in the body). On an unknown date, the patient experienced JOINT SWELLING (ankles were swollen), PERIPHERAL SWELLING (fingers were swollen) and SERUM SICKNESS (had serum sickness from the vaccine). The patient was hospitalized from 26-May-2021 to 27-May-2021 due to CONDITION AGGRAVATED. The patient was treated with IBUPROFEN for Joint pain, at a dose of 600 milligram three times a day and PREDNISOLONE (PREDNISOL [PREDNISOLONE]) for Pain, at a dose of 1 UNK.

Per patient, immediately after being injected he had severe shoulder pain and since receiving the vaccine he has been unable to use his arm. His arm has been in a sling and he is being denied further medical evaluation. The Nurse who was present suggested he contact his family adding that the doctor injected too high.  He had the second vaccine with no adverse reaction.

I approached the patient and asked questions regarding symptoms and he stated he &#34;lost consciousness&#34; for a few seconds and was sweating. I waited with the patient for 10&#43; minutes and asked if his symptoms were getting better. I made sure he was awake and responsive. The patient stated he was feeling tingly and &#34;amphetamine-like effect.&#34; A few minutes later he was pouring the water on his head and decided to lay on the ground. Based on his response, I called 911. After paramedics arrived and checked his condition, his symptoms improved. Based on discussion with paramedics, it looked to be like a panic attack to vaccination.

                                                I received the vaccine around 11am and did not experience any adverse reactions aside from a sore arm throughout the day.  I went to sleep at 10pm and was awakened at 3am with moderate soreness in my arm and I began to feel feverish and woozy.  About 2 minutes later I could tell that I was going to faint.  The thing I remember was waking up on the floor next to my bed with my wife holding me up.  She said that I started making sudden, loud guttural noises and she was afraid that I had been choking.  She reached over to touch my arm and my body jerked out of bed and I hit the ground.  When I woke up, I realized that I had fainted (I have passed out after a flu shot a couple years ago, but that incident happened about 15 minutes after injection) and my entire body was trembling and sweating profusely.  My wife left the bedroom to get me some water and a cold towel.  I got myself back into bed and passed out again.  The trembling and sweating continued but gradually decreased for about 15 minutes until I felt back to normal.  After I had calmed down, I felt no adverse symptoms and fell back asleep and have felt fine since the incident.

                                                Persistent dizziness started 2 days after vaccine and has not gone away since, it has been 3 weeks.  The dizziness reminds me of getting motion sick or after you found the boat for a very long time but feeling when you get when you&#39;re off the boat at first.   They have tried taking vitamin c and d they have not helped so far.  The dizziness sometimes does get worse when doing certain motions

                                                I began to feel a little dizzy on 03-25.   This light lack of equilibrium steadily grew for the next couple days. I found my limbs had apparently began to lose strength.  breathing became difficult  as if I could only take 1/4 breaths unless I actively forced myself to inhale deeply.  I developed sleep apnea about this time.  Driving became difficult. I was walking and driving as if I was drunk.  When walking, it felt as if I was on a swaying ship. Driving felt like my workvan was in a constant crosswind that I wanted to correct from.  At this point, I stopped driving.  That was on 03-25.  On 03-26 I suddenly developed up-beat nystagmus in my vision that continues to this day, making me functionally blind.  I visited multiple urgent care facilities.  Received full panel blood work, urine tests and a MRI. All tests came out completely normal.   Doctors are baffled. I was given Valium to help with my eyes and that does help a little.  However I&#39;m still unable to see adequately to function without assistance.

                                                Patient developed dizziness, slight tingling and muscle tension in neck 45 minutes post Covid vaccination Dose #1 on 3/25/21. States symptoms stayed a day and went away however he felt &#39;off&#39; for a few days. About 4 days post-vaccination developed tingling/numbness and intermittent lightheadedness with slight difficulty breathing at night when trying to get to sleep. No swelling of face and no hives reported. Able to exercise (weightlifting &amp; biking) without SOB. Became concerned and went to ER on 4/6/21.

Denies SOB except when trying to go to sleep. Not sleeping well due to the feeling of not getting enough air when trying to fall asleep.  No fever, chills, N/V/D. ACS ruled out: EKG showed no signs of ischemia &amp; troponins WNL. PE ruled unlikely d/t no DOE, sats 99%, HR 71 in ER. Chest pain not reproducible on palpation. Referred for sleep study to evaluate for sleep apnea.

Second week I?ve been dizzy. No appetite. Face tingling and numbness. Headache. I was Covid tested which was negative. Primary doctor has told me it?s neuralgia. Still have dizziness and on and off numbness in back of head and jawline. Sometimes my tongue going numb. An hour or two later my cheek will go numb. Very strange and very annoying. I?m still fatigued with no appetite.  Really hoping it starts to get better soon.

About 10 minutes after vaccination the patient and his wife alerted me that he was feeling like he was going to pass out.  Also reported feelings of ringing in ears, nausea, cold sweats and very pale.  I had the patient sit on the ground.  I offered him water, but his wife got him a soft drink.  He notified us that he had not eaten today.  We gave his wife glucose tablets which the patient took 2.  He took the 2 glucose tablets while we waited for EMT&#39;s to arrive.  He had more color in his face after the soft drink and glucose tablets.  The EMT&#39;s evaluated him and decided to take him to hospital out of caution.

                                                Extreme pain in heels of both feet within 24hr of vaccine injection.  Difficulty walking and standing. Constant pain in both feet during daytime and nighttime.  Particularly acute pain in morning after sleep.  After 1-2 weeks, pain remained in heels of both feet, but also migrated into lower ankles.  Swelling was present from the beginning of the episode, but increased over time.  Pain and swelling abated 3 weeks after first vaccine dose for about a week.  Second vaccine dose occurred 3-29-21 and pain/swelling returned.  Pain in heels was still present at this time, but majority of pain migrated to ankles and achilles regions.  Swelling increased by week 5 to become obvious Edema.  Acupuncture did not help.  Stretching did not help.  Rest and elevating feet did not help.  Magnesium supplement may have helped relieve pain, but I am unsure. Compression sock did not help. Ibuprofen did relieve pain but not swelling.  By week 9, no relief from symptoms.  Podiatrist x-rayed affected areas and found no structural issues, but was concerned with Edema.  Administered steroid dosepack for 6 days.  Symptoms immediately abated.  No symptoms as of today.

After Receiving my second dose, I experienced a second surge of all these symptoms. I will describe them in the next Vaers entry.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna vaccination at Publix pharmacy. He was instructed to remain in the area for 15 minutes for observation but he went to get something to drink with his wife. At checkout he fell and personnel was immediately called for assistance. When I arrived from the pharmacy to check on patient he was alert but clammy and covered in cold sweat. We removed his mask and called the EMS. Patient wanted to sit on the bench so he was escorted. He stated that he was feeling fine but he was very scared of needles which might have caused the incident. The EMTs arrived shortly after and took over the patient care. He was escorted out of the store by EMTs.

                                                Starting around 9:00pm with general malaise that developed into severe nausea and joint pain over next two hours. Pain was severe enough to bring tears. Began treating with Tylenol 650mg every 4-6hrs, which seemed to help initially. Starting around 11pm, I had severe chills with uncontrollable tremors lasting next 3-4hrs. Could not stop shaking, could not get warm. Intense joint pain continued. Was able to sleep intermittently from 2-3am, but awoke with return of severe nausea and vertigo/dizziness around 3am, accompanied by profuse sweating and hot flashes. I laid on cold tile floor with ice-pack on head/chest until it passed, about 30min, and nearly called for ambulance. Treated nausea by inhaling vapor from rubbing alcohol and taking a dose of zofran dissolving tab, which seemed to help. Able to sleep 4am-9am May 15th and return to normal diet. Malaise continued throughout 15th, but gradually subsided. Rashes in armpits and hot sweats night of 15th. I appear to be mostly normal as of today, May 17th.

                                                Beginning the night of 5/14,  the injection date, I began to feels strong aches and mild fever. Through the night the aches became severe enough to prevent sleep and I began to experience intense bouts of chills, followed by fever and profuse sweating. These symptoms continued through the day on Sunday 5/16. On Monday 5/17 I felt the symptoms lessening, and on Tuesday I felt better after a full 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Wednesday 5/19 I woke up feeling dizzy and disoriented. My limbs were weak and I was feeling body aches again, though not as sever as after the initial shot. I have a fever of 101.1 degrees F and have reached out to my PCP to give me direction on what to do next.

They gave me a check up. I had paralysis in my left hand and was not able to move it. I was taken to the ER and had to do motion tests. I am able to move it now, but I have difficulty. I still have pain in my hand and arm.

                                                Patient was in the designated waiting area after having received a vaccine. He was seated in a chair just outside the vaccination room.  After about 10 minutes he was observed to suddenly fall to the side of his chair to the floor.  The Cashier quickly called to me for help, I quickly ran out to the patient and found him face down on the floor attempting to raise his head and look around,  I told him to  remain on the floor and we turned him over and kept him lying down on the floor.   I asked him what he could see,  if it was fuzzy or unclear.   He stated that I seemed to look clear to him.  He stated that he didn&#39;t want to be on the floor and wanted to sit down, so I helped him into the chair and I sat down in a chair directly in front of him.  With in  a minute he stated that he was beginning to be light headed again. I noted that he was losing his color.  I asked him to lay down on the floor again. We got him a pillow for his head and a bottle of water to hydrate him.  We also put a cool compress on his forehead.  Through questions I asked, again it was determined that he has had no history of any seizures, and had fainted before when it had been too hot.  We were able to have him get us his father&#39;s phone number and we called him to come to the pharmacy from home.  Patient remained on the floor till the father arrived and we asked him a few questions. Father wanted the BP taken, so we did, it was 122/69  Pulse rate was 72.  Father wanted to give him a sugar pill because he thought that might increase the blood pressure some. So we gave him one glucose tablet. Patient then expressed that he was ready to try and stand again.  We helped him stand up and allowed him to take a few steps and to monitor him.  We brought over a powered scooter to have him sit on out to his dad&#39;s vehicle.  It didn&#39;t have enough power so we had my Tech and the Patient&#39;s father escort him out to the car with out incident.  We asked them to call us if they had any questions. The Father was asked if he was going to take his son to be checked out and he didn&#39;t feel it was necessary.

                                                In September of 2020 I was diagnosed with partial central retinal vein occlusion. It had gotten better in January, but after taking the vaccine it got much worse. I went to my routine follow up and the doctors discovered that the vein is clotted and blocked. This has caused me to lose vision in my right eye. Since then I have noticed my exercise has greatly decreased. I normally run 8 minutes 30secounds per mile. Now I am struggling to get to 10 minutes a mile. I now have much more fatigue throughout the day.
