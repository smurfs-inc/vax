Meclizine and Ondansetron was used immediately.  Scopolamine was prescribed by the physician on 01/08/2021,  picked and used on 01/09/2021; felt better . Residual dizziness remains after use.     P.S. I do have a medical history of BPPV for the last 2-3 years and have been treated for it. Generally speaking my BPPV symptoms resolve themselves quickly after treatment. This current episode has lasted  forthree days.

These symptoms lasted for 48 hours and gradually subsided.  His wife (me) was so frightened that I will not be getting the Moderna series since it&#39;s so dangerous and will caution friends and family as well.

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

Uncomfortable but never to the point of difficulty breathing. ~08:30, BP 128/99 (I think) Systolic up only a bit.  Diastolic very high for me sent to urgent care part of clinic.   Monitored BP, oxygen, did EKG (normal), symptoms started easing ~ 09:40.  Sent home. Attending PA though it might just be a Vaso-Vagel response, but, after hundreds upon hundred of needles, I&#39;ve never had such a response, and, my symptoms did not involve a low BP, fainting or nausea, rather I remained conscious, had throat constriction with increased BP and a narrowed pulse pressure  range.

                                                In summary this is a 60 year old male who was normal functioning presenting to hospital 4 days following second moderna COVID-19 vaccination with AKI, Rhabdomyolsis, Confusion/Delirium with agitation, multiple acute brain infarcts, DVT, and multilobar pulmonary embolism.  24 hours following vaccination patient began to become slightly confused while driving his wife to her vaccine appointment.  Symptoms progressed and included severe fatigue and muscle aches.  Patient was taking tizanidine and oxycodone to manage muscle / body aches which had been prescribed for his chronic back pain issues.  Patient was noted to be excessively sleeping, and also had fallen twice between vaccination and hospital presentation. 4 days following vaccination he presented to the emergency department with severe lethargy and confusion.  He was admitted with presumption of overdose of medication, given activated charcoal.  A CT of the head (4/11/2021) was completed which demonstrated No acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection or acute territorial infarct. Suggestion of a chronic lacunar infarct involving the left lentiform nucleus. Regions of low attenuation involving the cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left, which, allowing for image degradation secondary to patient motion artifact, are likely artifactual in nature; follow-up is recommended to assess for stability/resolution.For first several days patient suffered delirium with agitation, he was disoriented to place and time.  CK on admission, 4/11/2021, was 17,086, indicating rhabdo.  Creatinine on admission was 4.39, indicating new acute renal failure. Liver enzymes were elevated with AST of 477 and ALT of 218. PT was 10.6, INR 0.99.  ABG demonstrated metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.22, co2 45, HCO3 18.4.  Over several days his mentation improved however was noted to still need light supplemental oxygenation.  Because of the delirium a brain MRI was completed on 4/13/2021, which demonstrated acute ischemic infarcts on DWI sequence noting bilateral, right greater than left, acute cerebellar infarcts. Small acute lacunar infarcts at bilateral basal ganglia/genu internal capsule.  Due to the infarcts a stroke workup was completed. Carotid duplex was performed and notable for only small bilateral carotid plaque.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable.  A CTA of the chest was completed on 4/15/2021 for continued hypoxemia, need for nasal cannula to maintain spo2 saturation.  Findings included multilobar pulmonary embolism.  Venous duplex dopplers of the lower extremities were also completed on 4/15/2021 demonstrated an isolated left popliteal vein DVT. No evidence of right leg DVT.  Over several days CK and Cr returned to baseline / normal levels.  He remains hospitalized and is still undergoing treatment.

                                                I haven?t had the chills like that in forever! It came in waves. You just lie there, hot, and ache all over, then this wave of chills hits for maybe 5 seconds then dissipates. The 2 mins later, it happens again! And this goes on for  an hour or more! I had to pee but was worried I?d be too cold to stand still. So I waited until I could not wait anymore. OMG! Trying to stand up! It?s as if my joints no longer worked! And when I did stand up I was dizzy as hell! The next day, utter exhaustion. I am so weak, it takes effort to move. Even breathing took work! I didn?t sleep all night as every position I lay in was uncomfortable and had twinges of chills. The amount of energy it takes to physically get up and walk to the bathroom is dumbfounding! This morning I am achy, hot and cold, exhausted, and just had a bout of dry heaves. I?m hoping to be able to get some sleep today.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

Moved to Tendonitis/Arthritis wrists, hands, fingers and Left patellar knee tendon. SLOWLY improved but did not leave, despite treatment with Aleve, until 2nd vaccine 2/5/2021. Then, same symptoms worsened and included BOT patellar tendons, nd plantar tendons. Continues to present and are very painful at night, despite 2 Aleve BID daily, and  cannot make fist or extend fingers on  both hands and cannot walk on feet without pain at MTP&#39;s. Discussed with orthopedic surgeon who assured me that I was having &#34;an immune reaction in tendons to vaccine. It should get better over time&#34;. It has not at present.

Took Tylenol  and slept throughout the day.  Got up around 12:30pm, felt better, did decide to go for a jog to get body temperature  up.  Jogged for 60 minutes, returned, ate and rested again.  4th day, felt much better, no dizzyness, still a little tired but maybe 85% energy level.  5th day back to normal.

I didn&#39;t get hurt but it felt like I almost passed out.  I fell backwards against a wall and slid down. I did not report this to my doctor previously listed.

Speech was normal, grip strength equal and strong.  Blood pressure was low (85/58), HR 94.  Client drank 12 oz water over 5 minutes, BP improved to 95/60 w/ HR 86 (11:48).  Client still c/o blurry vision and light headedness, but was talkative and making jokes.  He started to stand (to test his balance) but was still unsteady. Gave him another bottle of water, explaining re: low BP and hydration.  Reassessed after an additional 5 minutes (11:53) with BP further improved to 100/62.  Denied improvement in vision or lightheadedness.  Client sat for 30 more minutes.  I attended to another client at 12:00, with another RN monitoring him.

While in bathroom, became dizzy, broke into sweats, and felt I was about to faint. I went to my knees holding onto counter. My wife came in to help me in bathroom. She observed I was incoherent but uttering moaning sounds and breathing heavily. She called 911. While on phone I came to and vomited into sink. It appeared I had not digested anything from dinner that night. After vomiting (1x) I felt much better.  First responders reported normal vital signs. I did not go to E.R. that night but went to Urgent Care later that morning and all seemed fine.

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, the symptoms started with a stiff neck and headache on the left side including soreness at the injection site. As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.   As a school teacher, I have taken the appropriate precautions and received a Covid19 test: Results negative.

                                                After receiving the first Moderna vaccination in my Left arm, I started feeling pain in the area of the vaccination site on the evening of 03/22/21. As time progressed I started to realize I was losing all motion in my arm and weakness on my entire left side of my body, but assumed this was a side-effect of the vaccination .  I was not concerned until my wife alarmed me in the morning when she looked at me and noticed the left side of my face drooped and had that I had difficulty standing, no balance, little use of my left leg and no use of my left arm and hand.  At that point, 7:00am 03/23/21, my wife drove me to the ER.  I was admitted and an inpatient for 15 days including PT/OT/ST therapies at the hospital for Stroke.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Pain, Rash, Panic attack (2 episodes) and Anxiety. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: PREDNISONE (for 6 days). Concomitant products included PREDNISONE for Pain and Rash, METHYLPREDNISOLONE (MEDROL DOSEPAK) for an unknown indication.    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking), GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse). At the time of the report, POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse) had not resolved and HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Since the patient&#39;s first dose of the Moderna vaccine, he had not been on prednisone the whole time but was recently put on a Medrol pack. He was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica as his pain became more consistent after the first dose of the vaccine. His pain is in his arm and shoulders, his left hip hurt and he was not able to lift his arm all the way up.  The patient believed that the vaccine may had caused an inflammatory reaction that aggravated his pain that was present before the vaccine. The patient also stated there was a time that he was not able to get out of bed, he was shaking, and had to use a cane to walk. He says he never had joint pain, only stiffness when waking up and soreness in his hip and leg that was painful. After the vaccine, his arm hurt to the extent he could not sleep on it and the pain in his legs had worsened. He makes it very clear he had a lot of pain prior to the vaccine, but the pain he was experiencing now is more consistent.

                                                Patient was monitored for 1 hour after receiving his vaccine as requested by his primary care provider due to history of reaction to a previous vaccine. Patient monitored by EMS provider x 1hr, no s/s adverse reaction. Patient started walking out of facility on his own and came back reporting he felt dizzy. He was initially hypertensive with a pulse of 70, respiratory rate 12, systolic BP 188.  We had him lay down and about 10 minutes later his blood pressure was 140/70.   After another 10 minutes or so we had him sit and drink water but his dizziness, while improved, did not go away and he started to have chills and was visibly shaking so 911 was called as we did not feel he could drive himself home. Patient was monitored in the emergency department at Hospital x 1hr and released with blood pressure WNL.

                                                On Saturday 01/23/2021 morning when I got out of bed I experienced difficulty maintaining my balance. I had to use a wall to be able to stand. I did not fall. I stumbled into the bathroom, still unsteady. I urinated sitting down, still feeling unsteady, head spinning. I took my blood pressure 130/70, which is normal. Was feeling steadier. Was able to walk down stairs to ground floor of home. Still not felling normal, but steady on my feet. After eating breakfast, no additional symptoms through day. I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages over the past week. When I went to bed Sat night, lying in bed I was light headed. Sunday morning same problems. I performed some vehicle maintenance and would get down on the ground. Head would start spinning, everything would return to normal once standing. At bedtime same feelings when lying down in bed. Monday morning (today) same problems.

His symptoms persisted throughout the night into the next day (3/10/21), and he went to his primary care physician. He vomited multiple times in transport and at the physician&#39;s office. Due to the nature of his symptoms and his concurrent hypertension there was concern for stroke and he was taken to the emergency department at Medical Center for evaluation around 4pm. Stroke was ruled out, and he was sent home with a prescription for meclizine with a presumed diagnosis of vestibular neuritis. 3/11/21 patient did not leave the bed except to use the restroom, however vomiting controlled with meclizine. 3/12/21 symptoms persist and patient has not yet improved.

Pain is substernal, radiated to the left arm, associated with lightheadedness.  Denies diaphoresis or nausea.  Per EMS there were short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia  3/18: - remains inpatient admission as of 3/18/21 @ 0900 63 y.o. male with a past medical history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He states he was lifting a couch yesterday and his heart started beating fast.  He did not really have any chest pain, but felt a little bit lightheaded.  He called an ambulance and they brought into the ER.  In the emergency room his EKG did show some frequent PVCs.  However, he did not really require any intervention.  He was given 3 nitro, but it really did not make any difference in the way he was feeling.  The patient denies multiple times that he actually had chest pain.  He states he just felt like his heart was beating funny.  The patient&#39;s most recent stress test was a nuclear stress test in May of 2019.  Overnight, the patient has felt very well.  He denies any significant chest pain.  He denies any further heart palpitations.  On the monitor he would occasionally going to bigeminy, which is not abnormal for him.  EKG this morning was unremarkable.   After speaking with the patient&#39;s wife, she told me that he has had a several month history of very limited exertion.  She states every time he exerts he becomes extremely dyspneic and has heart palpitations and sometimes almost passes out.  She states last night he was extremely diaphoretic and very nearly passed out.

Currently, 8 days after the injection, my left shoulder joint remains sore and any motion to left my left arm laterally from my side is painful; like my joint is inflamed.  There is no redness or other visible external signs or discoloration.  I can not say for certain it is linked to the Modern vaccine as I&#39;ve had left shoulder issues infrequently in the past.  But timing wise, my current discomfort started shortly after receiving the vaccine.

                                                I started having dizziness two days after I received the 1st shot, it was strong the first 5 days, then it was lightly, mostly lightheaded and some dizziness depending on how I move my head. Today I have been dizzy for a couple of hours in the morning. My concern is that is not going away and I am worry, not knowing what to do. I contacted my PCP and left a message, I haven&#39;t talked to her yet.

                                                First unusual symptom the day after vaccine - felt as though we were experiencing an earthquake.  Unsteady balance since then.  I had aches common with flu shots, which are now (3/9) gone - these are not a problem.  Yesterday my apple watch said my heart beat was below 40 bpm for ten minutes a few times.  I tend to have a low heart rate so not a major surprise.  But last night when I got up, I lost balance and fell, hitting my head on a chest.  No major damage.  But feeling of dizziness is still a little present.

                                                I left the vaccination feeling nothing at all. I awoke the next morning with a moderate pain/discomfort in my left upper arm at the vaccination site. I went to work because I felt okay.  I have five years of recovery.  As a result every 8-12 moths I undergo an episode of about three days where my brain forgets how to sleep properly.  So the morning after my injection, I was on my second day of irregular sleep. Around 10 am, the side effects started kicking in.  I had a slight to moderate pain above my ear on the right side of my head.  I probably had a slight fever as I felt warm and sweaty for about four hours.  I felt slight to moderate chills during the height of my discomfort for about four hours.  I could hardly walk the five blocks to my girlfriend&#39;s home because I was very conscious of my breathing.  (I have been a heavy cigarette smoker for 4o years and an developing a heightened awareness of my breathing and pulse as I feel that I am overdue for a stroke or heart attack after 40 years of heavy smoking.)  Therefore his side effect was largely hypochondriacal.  I took off work yesterday even though the side effects had subsided. Today, I feel great. I feel so great that I laughed at the entry below - &#34;Patient Died&#34;.

                                                ADVERSE EVENT REPORT: MODERNA VACCINE 1 of 2 Dates: Feb. 17 to March 16, 2021  1. I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

                                                On 3/20/2021 I woke up with vertigo (never have had it before).  After symptoms persisted all day  iwent to Doctor on 3/21/2021. After examination of the ears was normal I was prescribed Meclizine 25 MG tablet (1 tablet 3xs/day by mouth); Ondansetron ODT 4 MG Tablet (1 tablet by mouth prn for nausea every 8 hours); and, Fluticasone Proprionate Nasal Spray USP (2 sprays in each nostril every day at bedtime).  Symptoms persisting today and I have made an appointment with my ENT for tomorrow 3/23/2021 at 8 a.m. for evaluation.  Saw on website that numerous similar reactions thought by the reporters on that website to be vaccine related so I thought that I should report my situation.

                                                Upon waking on the third day after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I&#39;ve experienced vertigo/disorientation.  This side effect has continued a second day causing me to notify my primary care provider and preparing this event report.  Other side effects experienced after the second vaccination were soreness at the injection sight, mild fatigue, and slight fever which were all anticipated. These side effects have passed.

My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

                                                Received vaccine approx 11:20am, no issues until 10:30pm when I started to feel chilled. I took my temp with a forehead thermometer and it read 98.x. I put the thermometer on my nightstand thinking it prudent to have it handy. In bed under covers I kept feeling cold and started shivering/teeth chattering, within an hour or so my forehead thermometer read 102. My recollection of the time between midnight and 2 to 3am is vague as I was very disoriented, I recall taking my forehead temp several times during those hours - that took a lot of effort, and I saw several readings of 105 and I believe one over 106. I remember thinking I should be in the ER, then thinking how could I get there, then thinking I would call 911 but that I could probably not get my mind/body to be able to physically make a phone call. I believe that during this time span I had brief periods of consciousness when I was somewhat aware that I was having a high fever event, but that there wasn&#39;t much I could do about it (I live alone). By 4am I was more aware, forehead temp reading was 102.something - I got up and made my way to the kitchen, I was unsteady on my feet and remember telling myself to be careful and not to fall. Temp gradually dropped throughout Tuesday, mostly back to normal on Wed.

Went to bed at 8:00 due to fatigue.  Felt nauseated.   Was hurting really bad with the joint pain that lasted until about 2:30 AM.   He woke up this morning and is feeling much better.   He did not take anything for the pain.  It attacked his joints mainly his ankles and knees and was not able to move.  His knees felt hot to the touch.

                                                History      Chief Complaint Patient presents with ? Elevated Blood Pressure ? Dizziness     multiple times a day   Patient who presents to the emergency department today for evaluation of hypertension, head pain, blurry vision, and neck pain. He states about 6 months ago he had open heart surgery. Since that time he states that he has been having intermittent episodes of blurry vision usually lasts a few minutes and resolve on their own. Today however, he notes that the blurry vision lasted for greater than 5 minutes and he started to become concerned. During that time he also began to experience some pain in his neck and a headache in the back of his head. He took his blood pressure at that time and noted that his systolic blood pressure was in the 190s. This alarmed him and so they called EMS. When EMS arrived they rechecked his blood pressure again and his systolic blood pressure was over 200. Upon arrival here to the ER he states that he is feeling much better and his blood pressure appears to be better as well. At this time he states he still having some right shoulder pain and a little bit of right-sided neck pain but he does state that he had his Covid vaccine yesterday in his right arm. Currently patient states he still has a little bit of a posterior headache but it is much improved. He denies any fevers, body aches, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or swelling of the lower extremities. He has no known drug allergies.       ? ED Course: I discussed physical exam finding with patient. Apparently most of his symptoms have already resolved at this time. His blood pressure is back down to 142/98. I still advise since he was having some weird blurry vision I would like to get a CBC, CMP, troponin, EKG, and a chest x-ray. Patient agreeable to this plan of care. We will also continue to monitor his blood pressure to ensure that it does not spike back up.     Patient&#39;s work-up was unremarkable. His blood pressures down to 123/60 and states he is feeling much better. This point time it sounds like what happened was a hypertensive urgency. I advised him he needs to contact his PCP and schedule close follow-up discuss if anything further needs to be done. At this time though he is safe to be discharged home with strict return precautions.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

Discharged per wheel chair to lobby in alert/stable condition, to wait on bus to take him home. At 18:00 his neighbor heard him fall, could not get patient to answer phone, found him unresponsive. Neighbor called 9-1-1, ambulance personnel could not revive patient.  Coroner&#39;s office ruled his death as Natural Causes due to Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Diabetes, ESRD.  There were no indication of anaphylactic reaction noted when I questioned the coroner&#39;s office. The Coroner&#39;s office/EMS were aware the patient had received the Moderna COVID 19 vaccination that day.

                                                A little over 12 hours after getting my first Moderna shot I experienced severe joint pain in my left knee that caused my entire left leg to become so painful I could not move it at all, as if I pulled an ACL. I decided to ride it out as each day went by the pain subsided more and more to where after 3 to 4 days later the pain was about 90% gone.  I still feel a little bit of soreness on the left side of my left knee cap though.  I am mostly back to where I was before the shot.  During the first few hours of the worst pain I did experience a cold sweat also.  All in  all I am feeling pretty good now however, a bit concerned about my second dose scheduled for March 23rd though, especially considering that I have neve had a negative reaction to a any type of vaccine before and I am not allergic. Great thanks to all!

                                                Began feeling very weak with a constant headache that later led to blurry vision on March, 2, 2021.  On the morning of March 4, 2021,  I was still experiencing a right sided headache as well as double vision.  I was no longer able to drive at that point.  I took my blood pressure digitally at the local pharmacy twice where it was 200/104.  I went home to call my physician and also have my wife take my blood pressure manually.  My blood pressure at that time was 214/106.  I went to the hospital where they examined me and then discharged me with a General Headache without a know cause.  I contacted my PCP and he advised me to quadruple my Lisinopril until my BP came down to normal range and see him the morning.  My visit the next day showed an elevated blood pressure, double vision, and a continuing headache.  My meds were adjusted to Lisinopril 10 mg qd and an addition of Norvasc 5 mg qd.  Later that day my blood pressure was down, but still not in the normal range.   The following day, March 6, 2021, I was still having the same issues despite the changes in medication.  I took my blood pressure at 6 pm and it was 199/104.  I immediately went to another hospital where I was admitted as  a &#34;stroke alert&#34; patient in hypertensive emergency.  I am presently being followed as an inpatient in order to get these issues under control.

Eventually dizziness subsided but had mild nausea all day. Dizziness returned each morning for following week but not as severe as on the 19th. Went to an urgent care where they gave me rapid and pcr covid tests. Both came back negative. Also checked heart and blood pressure multiple times. Everything was normal. Reported everything to my doctor. On March 6th, woke up at 7am with severe dizziness and nausea again. Dizziness is subsiding and nausea is gone. Seeing doctor on March 10th and will discuss then.

                                                On 03/11 I received 1st shot of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA,  after about 8 mins I became very light headed and short of breath after about 10 mins.  I felt a rush come over my body followed by rapid heart beat. These symptoms lasted about 2 mins then subsided. I really didn`t want panic everyone  or go to the hospital all I wanted was fresh air so I left, admittedly not my smartest move but I knew my doctors office was right across the street.  After 24 Hrs. still Light Headed, no breathing issues, heart rate normal  sore arm no rash.

                                                Exactly 4 days after receiving the vaccine I experienced intense stiffness of muscles and joints from neck to ankles.  I struggled to get up from sitting and then could barely walk until I was moving for a short while; then it was easier to walk but with the pain of the sore muscle/joint feeling.  It felt like I had been beat up, especially in my upper torso front and back.  It stayed the same until approximately 3:00 a.m.  on the second day.  i noticed the pain, stiffness, and difficulty moving was getting better.  It gradually continued to get better for the next 24 hours until completely gone.  My calf muscles were the last to return to normal.

                                                Prior to the vaccine on 2/13/21, He was a healthy 65 year old active college professor.   32 hours after the vaccination on 2/14/21, He had acute pancreatitis, which led to  septic shock and respiratory failure, and he was placed on a ventilator at  Hospital.   On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

Pt reported ~3-4 days post-vac of 1st dose, pt experience ache and pain in every joints &#34;joints felt like I was crippled&#34;, reports his whole body was in agony only with movement but not at rest. Pt reported that these symptoms did not subsided and the 2nd shot seems to make the symptoms worse per had lots of muscle pain and he could not move, had to have his wife help him in and out of the bed. Pt reported he took extra strength Tylenol on 2/27/2021 after his 2nd shot for a duration of 3-4 days which provided no relief. Pt reported that just approx. a little over a week prior to his scheduled orthopedic surgery (2/18/2021 - for an microscopic surgery for his torn MCL in his left knee), pt was seen by his orthopedic surgeon because his left knee had puffed up on the side, as a result his doctor drained his left knee and gave the pt a cortisone injeciton in his left knee to reduce inflammation. Pt reports that after rcvding cortisone injection he felt great and all his ADEs from the Moderna vaccine subsided. Pt reported that his orthopedic surgeon had adv that his ADEs of joint and muscle pain and achiness may be vaccine related. Pt reported doctor prescribed him Methylprednisolone 6 days dosing regimen approx. 1 month ago, and while taking pt reported he felt great and all symptoms subsided. Then approx 3-4 days post last Methylprednisolone dose was taken pt reports all his symptoms came back again. Pt reached out to his orthopedic surgeon again and got another prescription for Methylprednisolone and just completed his last day of dosing today and reported no pain again while on the treatment. Pt have another follow up appointment with orthopedic surgeon on 5/4/2021.  Recommend pt to monitor if any of those symptoms occur again, and if so discuss with doctor and contact MD for further evaluation.  5/5-Patient does not have any pain at this time, he went to see orthopedic surgeon yesterday on 5/4/21  to get another Methylprednisone script just in case of relapse since the steroids significantly helped with pain in left knee. Ortho surgeon did not refill Methylprednisone script. Patient is upset and is at primary provider&#39;s office today to get another script.

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

                                                Patient became pale and felt faint while sitting in the observation area after receiving the vaccination. He was alert and talking but quickly reported the need to lay on the floor with dizziness and faintness. The patient began feeling better after laying down and wanted to then sit in the chair again. After sitting up a second time the patient fainted in the chair and was guided to the ground where he became alert again and waited until the medics arrived. After some time with the medics the patient began feeling better and declined to be taken for further medical treatment.

                                                Received shot at 6pm thursday. Friday I felt tired, and by late afternoon had temperature of of 100.4.  I felt fine when I woke on Saturday, and felt pleased that my immune system was apparently working properly  Seeing nothing in the Moderna fact sheet about avoiding alcohol,  at dinner I had 3 and a half cocktails. Had no problem walking home and walking the dog, but after getting in bed, I had a much stronger reaction to the alcohol than I ordinarily would - vertigo, and the next day, extreme tiredness.  Though I don&#39;t ordinarily drink that much, I&#39;m a large man, and it doesn&#39;t affect me as  much.  I&#39;m concerned that the alcohol may have affected the efficacy of the vaccine, and wonder if avoidance of alcohol should be mentioned in the fact shett.

I did not have a thermometer but I?m certain I had a fever. This lasted throughout the night. The following morning I was bedridden, unable to eat and had flu like symptoms. This is continued for three days now. I am slowly Beginning to gain strength but I?m still bedridden.

Sunday morning it broke and I was starting to come out of it. Today I&#39;m not feeling 100% but much, much better.

                                                Extreme pain in the left shoulder and arm at the injection site. Unable to lift arm past height of shoulder or head without further pain. Pushing with the left hand on an object creates pain in the arm and shoulder. Resting on the elbow will also create the same pain. The pain is constant. At night I usually wake up between 1 and 3 am from the throbbing pain. According to the physician, the pain seems to mimic a rotator cuff injury, which I do not have, nor have I had. I have been taking Motrin 2 to 3x per day, and Extra Strength Tylenol during those 1 to 3 am morning wake-ups. Putting the left arm thru a shirt is a painful task. Outside of arm at injection to the touch creates pain.

                                                He complained of dizziness the evening of the shot.  He went to bed and when he woke up the next morning he was having double vision.  Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

Other than that, took no other prescriptions or supplements until the evening of March 18, 2021. Throughout March 18, 2021, patient felt occasional periods of weakness and took bedrest for it. Probably slept an additional 3 to 4 hours during the day. By evening of March 18, 2021, patient was feeling more normal. On March 19, 2021, patient experienced no adverse effects.

                                                Lower legs felt tired and sore., muscle pain. Progressively got worse over the month of February making it nearly impossible to bend, raise and lower myself. Saw my personal doctor on March 1st. He does not think it is vaccine related. Rans some bloodwork tests. Put me on Prednisone for 3 weeks. That did alleviate the muscle soreness/stiffness  but that seems to be starting to return now that I am no longer taking it. Have a Dr. appointment with a Rhuematologist on Friday 3/26/2021.

                                                My left arm is in excruciating pain I cannot use nor could I sleep first night. Arm is almost dead in some ways. I cannot life past my mouth as cannot even extend very well.  Severe pain, aching also pain down shoulder into right hand. I have tried icing, heat, applied Cold spray. It is slightly painful 2 days later but still lots of pain. I cannot use arm to do chores. Even brushing teeth was hard. Arm was fine till 10 hours later then became worse and worse. Plus have little strength in arm. I cannot use arm to dry myself after shower.  Arm continues to be painful, aspirin does nothing to alleviate pain.  I regret getting vaccine and have doubts to complete series as I heard second shot worse.  I have not sought treatment yet but may go see my PCP this week.

                                                Extreme pain and weakness in the right leg [mid thigh to lower calf].  Unable to walk or climb steps.  Unable to stand unsupported.  Right leg buckles and gives out.  Unable to travel, or see my doctor.  The onset of my issues were very sudden and immediate, no lead-up.  In a sitting or lying down position, I am able to freely articulate and rotate my right leg without pain.  In the nine days since the onset, I have treated myself with Aleive and a heating pad for my neck.  The issues have lessened by less than 25%.        Background:  due to spinal cord injury in 1996, I have permanent damage; sensory issues on my right side [mid chest to foot], and motor issues on my left side.

This lasted about one minute and I did not pass out.  But about 25 minutes later, while driving home (alone), I experienced the same thing but for about 5 or 6 minutes.  Fortunately I didn&#39;t pass out.  About an hour after the shot I felt sort of back to normal.

When I awakened (about a minute later) I was unable to stand so I crawled to from the shower to bedside, but passed out again when I tried to pull myself up from the floor into bed.  My wife called 911 and the local fire department responded.  The EMT took my blood pressure while I was lying on the floor with my feet elevated and it was 78/34.  The EMT called an aid car and I was transported to a local ER.  At the ER, I received 2 liters of fluids over the next 4 hours.  I had an EKG, chest X-ray, blood work, and urine analysis which all were clear.  After 4 hrs, I was released and returned home.

                                                ?I recd the first moderna vaccine 2-13-2021 at 11 AM.  Headache, right side only, started same day at 7:30 PM, sore shoulder at vaccine site about 10:30 PM same day.  Both were gone the next morning.  I recd the second dose of the moderna vaccine 3-13-2021 at 11 AM.  By 2 PM I had a ranging head ache, again right side only.  I drove four hours to the vaccination site, hospital.  I was driving home when this started.  I stopped to purchase Tylenol about 3 pm which it turns out had no effect.  I was driving west into a setting sun, as the headache got worse, my eyes became more and more sensitive to the sun, I stopped a second time to purchase a second pair of sunglasses that I could wear over the first pair, that didn?t help, I ended up stopping at a rest area until the sun set.  I got to my house at about 6 PM, by then I could no longer wear my prescription glasses, besides the headache I was now very dizzy.  At about 9 PM the pain started, between my shoulder blades first, never at the injection site.  From that time on, including today, the pain has constantly moved around my body, the worst pain is associated with areas that arthritis affects me, hips, knees, hands, ankles.  I have had a mild fever, ranging from 100.9 Saturday night to 100.3 now at11 AM 3-15-2021.  Yesterday, 3-14, my head was swearing, my feet were ice cold.  I had an electric blanket from my waist down and an ice pack on head.  If I have ever felt worse in my life I don?t remember when that would have been.  The pain has moderated today, I expect the worst is now over.    If as the health specialists are suggesting a booster will be required this fall I will undoubtedly have incredibly significant reservations with this vaccine.

Given medication IV and orally, slowly improved enough to go home by 11:00 AM. Still dizzy on March 16th and occasional bouts of vertigo. I seem to be slowly omproving.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

The pain is impacting my mobility.  Prior to the shot, I exercised on a regular basis but have not been able to exercise since.

                                                I felt extremely dizzy at 5 PM and checked my blood glucose.  It was extremely high, 283.  I checked again in minutes to be sure the meter was functioning properly and it was 280.  The meter was accurate enough.  With my meds over the past 2 years it has NEVER been this high!  I did not eat or drink anything that could have caused this spike.  I had a healthy lunch at noon.  I began drinking a LOT of water and went for a 20 minute aerobic walk.  At 6 PM glucose was down to 195.  At 7:30 PM glucose was down to 135.  Dizziness began to subside this whole time period.  I will continue to monitor glucose closely.

                                                As a physician for over 40 years I tend not to pay attention to my symptoms if I develop the flu or a virus. I just put up with it  I received a COVID-19 Moderna vaccination on January 7. Approximately 12 hours after I started to develop adverse reactions. These of Inc. severe myalgias, fever to 102, chills, headache, severe fatigue (to the point where it is difficult to get out of bed)  Not much reaction at the injection site. Hydrogen saturation  in the 90s and pulse in the 70s.  I did contract Covid in March 2020. I was alone for two weeks. However no respiratory problems or hospitalization.  I?m currently speculating that having had covered in March has resulted in a significant immune reaction from this vaccine.  I would appreciate your input on this.  Can I expect this again when I receive my second vaccine in one month?  Thank you

                                                Patient received the dose and sat down for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes he got up and looked to buy something on one of the aisle when he fell down, he was on his knees. The pharmacist got out there set him on a chair, looked for any injuries and asked him if his breathing was ok. He said everything was fine, and that he just tripped over his flip-flops. The other pharmacist called 911 while I stayed with the patient. He was fully aware of what was happening and he didn&#39;t present any signs of an allergic reaction. EMT showed up after 5 minutes and talked to him for 2 minutes, and told him he was ok to leave.

                                                The patient noted weakness starting in the legs on January the 19th, 10 days  after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.  The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

My wife had to help me get out of the recliner and get dressed for our trip. Also I was very confused. I was a bit nauseous and did not want to eat.  My blood sugar was 226.  For the next 6 hours as we traveled, I had to pee every 30-45 minutes. I needed help getting in and out of the rest stops and the vehicle.  As we traveled I mostly slept. I did drink a little diet soda, but did not eat.  After the 6 hours of travel I felt a stronger and was able to get out of the car and into the houses by myself.  For the next 24 hours I felt week, ate very little and sugers ran high.

Head spinning, very weak limbs, barely able to get out of bed and stand after extreme effort, no arm strength, could only move to the bathroom via baby steps with while holding on to whatever was available to steady myself.  I ended up on the floor and was barely able to get up and back into bed after considerable effort.  My arms and legs were like rubber.  I had fever and severe night sweats.  I was virtually unable to function.  This lasted from the night of 02/03 and continued through 02/04.  Finally 02/05 I was able to get out of bed and shakily stand. But I couldn&#39;t stay up long, as I had the aches and pains and a headache still.  Finally 02/06 I was able to get out of bed and stay out.  I hope my description describes the magnitude of my symptoms.  I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to survive.

Feb 3 about 13.5 hrs after second dose Moderna (3 AM), I showed no symptoms from getting shot at 1:30 pm Feb 2 until going to bed, but at 3 AM woke due to significant headache and arm soreness.  Laid there about an hour until I got our of bed at 4 AM, got Tylenol from hall closet and went in bathroom to take Tylenol.  I was fine until I tried to open Tylenol, and suddenly started sweating, dizzy, feeling faint.  Managed to get to floor with my wife&#39;s assistance, lay for awhile but couldn&#39;t get up to walk so crawled back to bed.  Had severe chills for over an hour until fell asleep.  Spend next 36 hours in bed due to headache and dizziness, very fatigued napping off and on, but chills never returned.  By evening of Feb 4 I felt stable enough to walk around the house and eat dinner meal at dining table.  Saturday, Feb 5 stayed home fatigued napping off and on.  By Sunday morning Feb 6 I felt good enough to play a round of golf without incident and felt 100% recovered by Sunday afternoon

Went home and about 2 hours later he noticed when he was moving around it started to get painful just opening a door, etc.  It continually got worse, and maybe 3 hours later in the evening the pain got really bad, and it seemed to be more in his shoulder area.  Gave the shot kind of high, and the pain was real bad in the shoulder and could not raise the arm or use it much at all.  It was also a throbbing pain where he could feel his pulse with the pain in the shoulder.  It was almost like they hit a nerve.  He is still trying to get over it on day #5.  Each day it is starting to get better.  By Sunday the pain was letting up so that he could use his arm.  He is doing stretching exercises walking up the wall and it&#39;s complicated.  He has a history of shoulder surgery and had a total replacement in the right shoulder, and wonders if his pain is related to the bad shoulder and the cartilage being bad in that shoulder.  He is supposed to have surgery on it.  But the arm is better, can lift it 75%.

Everytime I moved my eyes, I could hear a whooshing sound in my ears.  I had to wear sunglasses and stay in the dark, as the light hurt my eyes.  It lasted for 24 hours, and another 12 hours of  and extreme stomach ache.

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

                                                More than normal pain was experiences as the vaccine was being administered. About four hours after injection, extreme pain in left shoulder, rotator cuff, unable to move arm .  Had to take ibuprofen approximately every six hours for the next 24 hours.  Two days since the injection, the pain is about 20 percent less.  NOTE 1: The probable reason for the unusual pain was that the injection was given much too high on the arm, near the top of the shoulder. I went back to the pharmacy on March 6, 2021, spoke with senior pharmacist, and showed the injection location with the band-aid still on. He noted it was a &#34;bit high&#34; and who had administered the vaccine. He said he would look into the injection technique of the person who had administered the dose.  NOTE 2 - THIS IS THE REASON I SUBMIT THIS REPORT: While the situation is handled at the pharmacy in question, I believe that with the rush to get the vaccine into arms, the CDC may need to pay more attention to the experience level of those administering it, making sure they have the proper training and actually have learned the proper injection technique. The CDC&#39;s YouTube video I have seen on the injection technique is a bit long.  The segment beginning at the 2:40 minute point should be separated and labeled &#34;injection technique for adults&#34; and have it made clearer that the injection is at the CENTER of the deltoid, with the very top of the inverted triangle NOT being acceptable.  My understanding is that the pain level from injecting at the rotator cuff is unnecessary and can lead to SIRVA - &#34;Shoulder Injury from Vaccine.&#34; Please take the necessary steps to ensure the vaccine is being properly administered at the correct place in the arm. Otherwise, too many people will be undergoing unnecessary,  extreme pain as I have .

                                                Within 48 hours of second vaccine, I developed a red spot on my right foot that was tender next to my small toe. This area became very soar and I am unable to walk on that part of my foot without  extreme pain and swelling. I have not seen a physician yet, but doctor ordered an x-ray which he said showed no fracture. I am waiting to see a podiatrist . My foot has shown no signs of improvement so far.

He chose to take a nap, which turned into staying in bed until today.  By the next morning the back sides of his neck, rear corners have been achy.  He has been exercising them, rubbing them and trying to work them out but they still continue to ache.  It is getting less.  The arm ache has been steady as well and has been massaging it, he can list his arm but has some difficulty with it.  No previous neck problems.  Did not take anything for the achiness.

Told my wife that something was seriously wrong.  Tried to slowly move to side of bed but never made it before falling back into bed.   Waited to see if would improve and when it didn&#39;t my son and wife put me into car and I was taken to an Emergency Center.   I was hooked up for monitoring (pulse OX, cardiac monitoring, and an EKG was taken,   Blood Work was done, and the Doctor said he was worried about a stroke/and or tumor because I looked so bad coming into their facility with help from their Nurses and sent me to get a head CT.   When trying to get up from CT I  fell backwards onto CT table.   Whole room was not just spinning but was moving from floor to ceiling and then back to floor to ceiling.   When I got back to room Doctor performed tests on moving my head and following his finger with eyes.  He had to stop because I was spinning so much.  He told me that I had Nystagmus.

After 10 days, I have felt slight dizziness on a rare occasion.   I don&#39;t recall have dizzy symptoms  prior to the vaccine.

I had 1 to 2 episodes while driving, but the reality discontinuity were only 10th-of-Secs, so no impairment.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

Wife heard a loud crash and found me in bathtub.  I don&#39;t recall falling but shower curtain fell down and have minor neck and back discomfort at this time.  Wife assisted me to crawl out of tub and she reported I &#34;passed out&#34; two more times for short durations as I crawled back into bed. Had profuse cold sweating episode for about 15 minutes.  Much less weakness now at 10 am, no dizziness but still a mild headache.

                                                patient states that immediately following administration of covid vaccine on 2/5  he began to experience profuse sweating, dizziness and nausea. He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

He continued to feel lightheaded the next day and came to the ED and was admitted for syncope workup. His workup was negative. On discharge, patient recalled that he received his 1st Covid vaccine.  His symptoms resolved after admission. This event was likely related to his vaccination.

Of concern, blood pressure spiked to 149/78 (usually 120/70) and stayed elevated all day.  I contacted my cardiologist  late in the afternoon and he advised me to come in if the blood pressure did not return to normal the next day.  The next day, all symtoms disappeared and I felt normal.  When I received my second shot yesterday the doctor giving the injection said the blood pressure spike after the first shot was unusual and asked me to submit a VAERS  report.  My symptoms after the second shot  were a much more significant loss of mobility in the arm, which has returned to near normal.   but no blood pressure issue

                                                10 days after first dose of Moderna vaccine, I developed a very sore arm  starting with sharp pain at injection site and progressively radiating throughout upper arm and shoulder area, severe enough that I could not raise or use my arm.  This lasted about 24 hours and then started to dissipate throughout the next 24 hours.  I thought this was unusual because it was so long after the injection happened, and at the time of vaccination I had experienced very little arm pain.

                                                Approx 30 hours pot inj. I started shivering uncontrollably, went to bed for the majority of 18 hours. Alternating between shivers and sweating. Vertigo and dizziness made getting to the bathroom extremely difficult. Headache and body aches too. Woke up at 4pm on Sat. 2/27.  The headache may also have been a caffeine withdrawal effect since I slept through all day Saturday without having any coffee.  I was not warned not to overexert myself but 7 hours before I fell sick I was pushing a 8hp. Snowblower through heavy melting snow. I tired quickly so i stopped after ~ 30 minutes.  Felt much better Sunday morning

He had a hard time breathing as well so he went to the hospital.  They checked him out and ran tests but it was all in relation to the shot they thought.  Saturday he was very tired that he slept all day.  Sunday he was feeling better but had some issues with his vision and his peripheral vision went away for part of the day.

                                                This my second dose. Within five minutes I experienced lightheadedness and balance difficulties. These abated after twenty minutes. The injection site arm was very sore and grew even more sore throughout the evening and I had a slight headache about 7:00 PM, a rare occurrence for me -- I often only have one or two per year. The headache disappeared within about an hour after manifesting. By about 10:00 PM I was beginning to feel a general achiness all over, mostly manifested in my joints.  By the time that I awoke on Thursday, 03/25/2021, I was aching quite badly all over. By 5:00 PM on that date I felt as if I had chills and a fever but a check with a digital thermometer showed that my temperature was 96.4F.  By evening I was aching  even more severely and in pain - mostly in my joints and hands -- took to my couch and covered up where I dozed in and out. I took a generic acetaminophen around  7:00 PM.  When I got up from my couch around 10:30 PM on the 25th, the aching had abated quite drastically and by midnight the worst was over. My temperature registered 98.0F at 10:30 PM.  When I arose from bed around 11:00 AM on Friday the 26th, both my hands were still aching and paining badly but most of the other aches in my joints had dissipated. By 6:00 PM on the 26th  the severe pain in my hands had decreased to my customary levels of pain from arthritis.

                                                Initial symptom was difficulty urinating, then developed a fever and weakness. Fell in the bathroom.  Went to ER; they ran labs, did EKG, chest X-ray, covid test (negative).  Their conclusion was unspecified virus.  The next day he had slight fever and body aches, with pins and needles pain in arms and back.  Still having difficulty urinating.  Next morning still unable to urinate and having severe pain in abdomen.  Very weak and unable to walk.  We called 911 and had him transported to ER.  They inserted catheter and drained his bladder, attached bag to his leg.  Their diagnosis was inflamed prostate.  They did not address his weakness and inability to stand.  He was instructed to see his primary physician and a urologist after the weekend.  As that day progressed, he became unable to control his left leg.  By the next morning, he couldn&#39;t move either leg.  Called 911 and he was transported back to ER.  They attempted to do an MRI but the machine broke down.  He was transferred to a medical center that evening, where he had an MRI and was admitted.  The initial diagnosis was inflamed spine, but the 2nd day the neurologist told us he had a spinal stroke.

A new stroke 24 hours after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccination Moderna  On Tuesday April 6, 2021 the patient showered by himself, walked up and down stairs in the home and was able to walk with the assistance of a cane.  He received the Moderna vaccination second dose at 10:00am (I believe this was an adverse event caused by the vaccination)  Wednesday April 7th at approximately 1:30pm I noticed he was unresponsive prompting me to call 911. His MRI at Hospital clearly diagnosed him as having another stroke, causing patient to no longer walk and use the restroom without assistance.  He is still in the hospital. Hospitalization and Physical Therapy is needed to allow patient to continue practicing as an Attorney.

Rolled back onto my back, let my head clear, turned to my right, and got dizzy again.  Felt nauseous, but did not vomit.  Problem was worse with eyes closed than with eyes open.  Spent most of the day  in bed.  Vertigo slightly better on day 2 after vaccination, took Dramamine after consult with doctor.  Much better on day 3.  Essentially back to normal on day 4, but do experience slight dizziness upon waking before getting out of bed.

                                                Vertigo the morning after the injection; took 25 mg meclizine; rested for a few hours after which symptoms resolved to point where I could walk and function. Very slight effects  (like a heavy head - no headache) lingered for a few days. No medical attention sought.  Not sure if this is a consequence of the vaccination or a coincidence because I took the injection around 10:30 am and proceeded directly to join my relatives for a full day (eat, drink, beach, etc). Arrived home around 8:30 pm -   Around 3 yrs ago, I had dehydration induced vertigo (had to go to ER). Not sure if lack of hydration was the culprit here.   My concern is that with &#34;dizziness&#34; being a more common side effect of the vaccine (and vertigo also mentioned in some studies), I am concerned with the potential reaction after the second dose, when almost everyone we know who had side effects, got hit much harder after the second dose.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  After about 4 days from my second COVID shot, my left leg begin to feel uncomfortable when walking.  I try and walk 3 miles every day, but began to notice left leg discomfort and slight pain from my hip to my ankle when walking.  Do not notice this discomfort when sleeping or if my leg is propped up.  Feet are both fine and my right leg is fine, no pain.   Also notice that it is harder and slower getting out of bed in the morning and I get drowsy earlier at night than I used to.  By 9 PM I feel like I want to go to bed.

                                                Vertigo (Spinning, lightheaded, nausea and loss of balance .I had to use both a cane and walker. My primary care phuysician recoemneded that I go to ER on 2/23/21 to have Cat Scan (negative), EKG (normal), blood work (normal except high glucose reading). ER doctor diagnosis was peripheral vertigo not central and discharged me with recomendation to take OTC meclizine twice daily. The spinning side effect has virtually disappeared, still some lightheaded feeling and persistent equilibrium./balance problems exist that prevemt from me driving and performing most daily activities. My Chiropractor has prefromed the  Epley Maneuver twice now but has had very little impact on my equilibrium and balance issues, I have an appointment with a specialist Nuerotologist on March 10, 2021

Fortunately, the vomiting relieved the nausea, and Acetaminaphen broke the fever. Happily, after a very long night&#39;s sleep, the only remaining side effects are continuing fatigue and slightly sore arms.  Note: Form did not allow me to answer below about mild side effects from second shingles vaccine dose I had during the past year. Effects included chills, mild fever, headache, body aches, fatigue. The shots were given at the pharmacy in our local store, but I don&#39;t recall the date our other details.

                                                I had a horrid reaction to my second covid shot. I got it on Monday 3/15 and was fine Tuesday. I even walked for an hour on he beach with the dogs so I said ?this wasn?t that bad? ON THE MORNING OF 3/17. I woke up about 3 AM with a fever OF 104 and basically an inability to stand. I tried to get ofF the bed to go pee and fell to the floor from which I could not get up as I had no muscle control or ability to lift myself uo and using a small ladder t took a long time for me to be able to manage to get on my feet with my wife  assistance.  On the way to the bathroom i banged into walls almost falling again.  told me later I looked as though I had a stroke. I made it back to bed and my temp was 104.  Then 20 minutes later the process started all over again it?s me falling to the floor and not being able to get up. This time when i was finally  and my O2 at 80  heart rate 112 was able to get up after about 7 tries I again walked into walls making it to the bathroom. This whole process happened one more time but this time i took a cool shower to cleanup and get my temp down.  Got back to bed and took a Vicodin along with two Advil.  I woke up at 10 am. No fever, able to stand and walk no problem  I sure hope this is over. but tonight will tell. form Item below is checked patient died and there was no death

Shivering began at 1am and lasted until 6am.  Upon getting up I got real dizzy after urinating, decided to go back to bed, but could not figure out how to get back in, so I stood beside my bed until the dizziness went away.  At some point I must of figured I was ok as the next thing I know I&#39;m on the landing of the steps upstairs, which is 6 steps, and my son is saying to my wife &#34;I&#39;m calling an ambulance&#34;.  Upon arrival at Hospital. I heard them say he&#39;s severely dehydrated and his blood pressure is extremely low.  I also had a fractured right clavicle.  I was kept in the Hospital for 3 days.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history provided.).    On 15-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS (dizziness) and NAUSEA (nausea). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body) and RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department), HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure), DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), DIZZINESS (dizziness), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body), RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck) and NAUSEA (nausea) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   A pharmacist suggested the patient take Children&#39;s Benadryl followed by Zyrtec to help with the itching. These medicines have not helped alleviate his intense itching. On 1Apr2021, the patient collapsed and was taken to the emergency department. The patient was treated at the emergency department after he collapsed from low blood pressure. He was prescribed Hydroxyzine HCI 10mg for the itching by the emergency room physician, but the medicine has done nothing to alleviate the patient&#39;s symptoms.  Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Ras and nausea are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Monday night pt. became ill, threw up and had a fever.  He went to bed, but around 11 pm he woke up disoriented, unable to walk.  Was helped to the bathroom, but was unable to get back to bed on his own.  Fell on his bottom.  I had to call our son to come pick him up and help him back to bed, unable to hold his own weight..  Had trouble sleeping.  Abt 1 pm needed help getting up again, same disorientation, also fell off the toilet and needed help getting back to the bed, unable to hold his own weight.  Finally fell asleep.  Next day seemed fine enough. Tuesday night, became ill again, went to bed.  Got up to go to the bathroom, was wobbly, but able to make it.  Was helped back, wobbly but able to walk. Trouble falling asleep, fever, chills.  Finally fell asleep at 3 am Wed morning.  I had to go to the doctor early, so left him sleeping in bed.  When I came back around 11 am, he was still sleeping, snoring loudly.  Became concerned.  Wouldn&#39;t wake up.  Called Paramedics.  CT scan at the hospital revealed a brain bleed.  Transported to hospital. Put on support for almost 2 weeks.  No progress, no response.  Finally support was discontinued and he died April 19th at 7:52 pm.

Was confused , trying to give me his remote to do what with I wasn&#39;t sure.  He had trouble with getting ideas across.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal for him.  However, we called him this morning at 8:45 am and he was lucid, he stated that when he went home around 4 pm , his left arm , hand and face were numb.  He stated that he could not pick up his cap with his left hand.  Today he woke and feels normal.  He was lucid and able to present ideas in a normal manner.  He vaguely remembers coming back to the clinic yesterday.

                                                After loading my fishing wagon into my truck I closed the tailgate and started towards the door of my truck.  I suddenly became very dizzy and had to hang onto my truck to keep from falling.   It has not happened again but I have felt light-headed ever since.  I am due to get my second shot on 5  FEB 2021.

                                                At first I only had a sore arm. By early Friday evening, the night after the vaccination, I began having severe steady pain in my left kidney, along with sharp shooting pain at the same location.  I also had the expected headache and fatigue. I took Tylenol during this time, and still am. I was pretty much totally bed-ridden for 4 days.  I called my doctor on Wednesday, February 17th to report the severe reaction in my left kidney. The nurse told me that as long as I felt better each day then to weather it out and get  the second shot (scheduled for March 11).  Although I am feeling a little better, I am still taking Tylenol for the pain in my kidney. My exhaustion is lessening.

It sort of came in mild waves over the course of 2 to 3 hours. Never really disabled me just bothersome and made me want to just sit. Symptoms seemed to disappear after I ate supper.  I felt fine the next morning save fore some soreness just below the injection site.

                                                Patient with delayed vasovagal likely syncopal episode several hours after vaccine received:  &#34;I wanted to let my Dr know that I had an incident on Friday.  Sitting at home talking with my wife ant two friends and started feeling &#34;dizzy&#34;. They said I started shaking and head rolled back and I was out for a minute. I did not know anything had happened when I opened my eyes.  They insisted that I go to the hospital.  EMS came and tested me on the way to hospital- all tests good. Same at the hospital- you may have the results.   Not a seizure, no high blood pressure, maybe vaccine reaction? they weren&#39;t sure what it was, and wanted to keep me overnight and I said no thanks. Home about 5 PM I feel fine.  Please let me know if you want to go over.

                                                Vaccine was injected into the shoulder joint causing extreme pain.  Band aid was directly over the joint.   I was not able to move the arm for 3 days.  Couldn&#39;t sleep or get dressed.  Pain gradually subsided but 6 weeks later I still have some residual stiffness.  Reported to Publix corporate office who did not take the information.  They had me call the store directly.  Evidently there is no corporate follow-up for problems.

I was unable to sit up in bed without getting dizzy, had a headache, after walking 25 steps in my house I had to sit down due to shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat. Now, two weeks after vaccination I am experiencing a cough, syncope and occasional irregular heartbeat.

It settled after a while but came back somewhat less after breakfast but then resulted in vomitting. Repeat settling and return, vommitting after lunch. Found symptoms faded on and off but no more vomitting Friday. Unsteady walking due to imbalance. Saturday, more spinning but no vomiting. Sunday it seemed to resolve so long as I didn&#39;t look down or to my left while lying down. Monday mild imbalance so I visited my PCP,  who said it was likely BPPV, prescribed meclazine for the vertigo, and gave order for a physical therapist which I scheduled for Monday, 3/22/21 which was the earliest available appointment. Friday, 3/19, no problem

                                                I had felt a little crummy overall the afternoon of my second shot, but nothing specific aside from a slightly sore arm. The next day my legs started to feel funky, but I had a strong 4 wheel rollator and I continued on to assist my wife with getting her first shot at . By the time we got to the  elevators, after walking about two blocks the legs were feeling worse. On the way out my wife noticed me walking poorly and after about one block my legs &#34;gave out&#34; completely and I collapsed.

                                                28 days (March 20th) following 1st Moderna shot which was given on Feb 23rd, felt dizzy, weak and lightheaded leading to fainting (syncope).  Ambulance arrived and determined to take me to hospital after having 2nd syncope in their presence.  Remained in hospital overnight.  All vitals, heart and bloodwork were fine as seen by cardiac doctor and  determined it was dehydration.  Followed up with primary physician and told him I was urinating excessively.  He put me on Flomax 0.4 mg.  I had the 2nd Moderna shot on March 23rd and again was taken to the hospital on March 31st with same symptoms and near syncope and again was told it was clinical dehydration.  They told me to drink a combination of pedialite and water which I have been doing and I am still experiencing the dizziness, lightheadedness and weakness.  Woke up on April 4th and felt like my soul was being ripped from my body.  I honestly thought I was going to die. Looked on line and found forums of people experiencing similar symptoms.  Went to pharmacy and they recommended meclizine and have taken a clonipin for anxiety.  I am feeling better now, but worried about how long I will be experiencing these symptons.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

He felt okay for about 2 weeks then on January 29, 2021 he felt intense chest pain. Concerned it was a heart attack, he was brought to the hospital. He stayed one night and the hospital ran several tests like EKG, stress test and others. Found his results to be normal and was released on January 20, 2021. Even the moment he was released, he felt very dizzy but hospital was not concerned and thought maybe side effect of medication. He continued to feel dizzy, fuzzy brain and hard time staying awake during the day and sleeping through the night for the rest of the week. He passed sometime in the early hours of February 6, 2021. Doctor&#39;s suspicion is a blood clot. He has no history of blood clots, heart problems or any health issues.

                                                About 30 minutes after the administration of the vaccine, his case manager came to ask for assistance because the client was feeling unsteady and his speech seemed slower than it normally is.  She was worried about an allergic reaction.  He did seem a little shaky.  They had him sit on a bench outside for fresh air.  He said this was helping.  I took his radial HR.  It was regular, 70 bpm.  I was unable to get his blood pressure due to a broken cuff.  He was feeling much better at that point.  He did eat breakfast.  He said his arm felt fine.  No rash or hives observed and no shortness of breath.   His case worker brought him some water.  We sat there for about 15 minutes.  He felt much better and the case worker said he seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.

The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

                                                The day following the vaccine injection, Sunday, January 24, as I was finishing a 45 minute hike I began feeling dizzy.  I made it home, then felt nauseous and threw up, more drive heaves than food.   I laid down for awhile.  Since then I have felt woozy when I get up and start moving around.  The wooziness comes and goes.   I still have the symptoms.

                                                My dad experienced a neurological lapse that lasted a few days, but most certainly for 30 minutes while on FaceTime with me. He closed his eyes, and began rubbing his head. He wasn?t making much sense, and then stood up and faced away from the camera. He asked ?are you with me?? And then didn?t respond when I told him we were behind him. He began stumbling and I shouted for my mom. She called 911, they ran an EKG which was abnormal (due to his heart conditions), however the CT Scan and all blood work and tests at the hospital came back normal (outside of a much lower than normal heart rate) so they discharged him. He does not recall the entire morning.  He has been fine since, as far as I know, but has been instructed not to drive.  He followed up with his cardiologist a few days later and he believed it was neurological.  The neurologist immediately dismissed the idea that this could be the vaccine, despite my pushing. So I am filling this out to ensure all bases are checked.  My dad got the second dose of COVID vaccination this afternoon

On 3/5/21 at 3:00 am woke from sleep with extreme chills, goosebumps on the skin, and physically shaking to warm up. I had on the bed a sheet, quilt, and heavy comforter. I used the toilet to urinate and was not sure that I could walk back to my bed due to nausea and weakness. After resting, I placed another wool blanket on the bed on top of the comforter. Eventually, I began to warm up. Nausea and fever continued.  Muscles and joints ached. I slept on and off until 7:00 am. I did not eat any breakfast due to continuing nausea. I drank coffee, sat in my reclining chair most of the morning. at 12:00 noon, I ate a bowl of potatte and chicken soup.  My tempereature at this time was 99.5. I did sleep in the afternoon. Later in the evening my temperture had gone down to 99.  Today, 3/06/21 at 8:00am, I feel normal, tired but normal.

                                                Patient woke up at 2:00am, approximately 14 hours after dose #1. Patient states he got up and went to the bathroom, got out of the bathroom took 3-4 steps and his legs from his knees down went weak, and he went down in slow motion, could not hold himself up. He could not get back up onto his feet, so he crawled back to bed and got up into bed. Then around 5:00 got up and went to the bathroom again, and walking was hard, but he used a cane, the same thing happened again, and his legs went under him and he fell backwards and ended up on his back. He laid there for a bit and got legs straightened out and his arms had not a lot of strength from elbows down. He crawled back into bed again and about 8:00 am got up and had trouble walking and had to use a computer chair to steady himself. Then sat for a while. Had trouble getting his lower body dressed and about 10:00 am felt as if he had no strength and was going to fall again so he called his doctor. He talked to the nurse who told him to take some Tylenol and see how he was in a couple hours. He said he could get around with a walker but felt as if his legs would not hold him up. Patient states he has stiffness in his legs, but not weakness. By that night was using the walker ok, by the next morning he stated he was walking fine and did not need a cane or walker.

On 16th March at 7:30 am I started to feel dizzy and out of balance and then suddenly my hearing in my right ear went and I had a sort of wind noise in my ear but no hearing. At approximately 1:00pmmy wife called our Doctor and he said that this could be a rare side effect of the Covid Vaccine and to allow up to 24 hours for the effect to resolve itself. By 4:00pm.the effect did resolve itself but returned at 10:00amon 18th March and lasted for 4 hours. Since then I have been OK with no further effects.

It was difficult to walk.  I stayed in bed most of the next day with right leg elevated, and using ice to help pain and swelling. My wife and I suspected Gout, however it would have been a first for me to have it.  By 3/19 it felt a little better, but right foot still swollen, and my wife and I noticed a pronounced vein from the right knee down. She got scared that it could be a blood clot, so we called Dr and he ordered ultra sound, which was done on 3/19 in afternoon, but technician said that saw &#34;nothing&#34;.  Today (3/20) foot still sore and it&#39;s hard to put wight on it still.

Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

Strangely my right hand was frozen open.  Was unable to make a fist or grasp a water bottle.  When I tried to close my right hand I had a weird sensation in my hand.  It felt like electricity flowing down my hand and into my 4 fingers.  Left hand was not effected.   Had the same effect when I woke up a couple times during the night.  When I got up on Saturday morning the problem with my hand was gone.  Still a bit stiff, was fatigued, headache and body aches.  Sore arm for a few days.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

I was stuck in bed and did not want to eat. I did force myself to go through the drive thru and have a COVID test. My COVID test was negative. I still have a little bit of unsteadiness, feels like an inner ear balance problem.

                                                I had no issues with the first Moderna dose, but 5 days after the 2nd dose I experienced chills, dizziness and slight nausea when up and moving.  This lasted 2 days and started going away on day 3, but the dizziness is still slightly  present.  Also, during this time I?ve continually monitored my BP and pulse.  My BP has been elevated averaging around 165/95 (my normal is close to 145/85).  Pulse has been steady averaging around 66-68 which is normal for me.  Today,  my BP is around 150/90 so it?s slowly getting back to normal on day 9 (post vaccine #2).   Also, I had no other symptoms and my temperature was steady at 97 degrees since the vaccination.

                                                Pain in arm developed after several days. Pain continuing through today 2/24/2021. Soreness in arm not mediated by pain meds, including Tramadol 50 MG that I take for back problems. Injection site was never red nor swollen. Trouble lifting arm without pain. Limited mobility without pain. On scale of 1 to 10 with ten being worst, pain varies between 3 and 7 at times.  Also have developed partially uncontrolled high blood pressure not mediated by heart meds, chiefly losartan. Before first vaccine, I was taking 50 mg daily. Increased to 100 mg daily on 2/1/2021 without stabalizing BP. BP can range during day from 106/60 to 158/86 with Pulse in 60s.

By the next day rash had effected chest, stomach and back as well as the right arm.  Also developed a low grade fever (under 100) .  Rash is exacerbated by heat of the shower.  Rash migrated to the legs and is especially severe around socks.  rash seems to become more prevalent late in the day and in the mornings.  Mild dizziness when looking up or down.  Low energy and feeling very tired after mild activity.  Symptoms persist 9 days after injection

                                                On February 18th - My dad started with fever/chills within the next day after getting his second shot, stopped eating/lost appetite, couldn&#39;t eat anything - couldn&#39;t eat any solid food - only had liquids and Ensure for 10 days.  He has also experienced pain in his chest pain (unclear if muscle pain).  He is still experiencing discomfort.    Has lost weight. Then got a little better for 2 days, then lost appetite and unable to get out of bed.  Then arm and legs swollen on 3/9/2021 but swelling has gone down today. He is conscious but is having a hard time getting out of bed and has no energy.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there.

                                                Using V Safe I reported mild symptoms of soreness &amp; swelling at the injection site which abated by day 5. V Safe stopped communicating by Friday, 3/19. I&#39;m trying to make the CDC aware that they are missing reportable adverse react because of limited follow-up. I developed itching at the injection site on 3/20 in the a.m. I note approximately a 15 cm area of erythema around the injection site. On 3/20, after a 5 mile walk I felt similar symptoms that I had in the first couple of days after the injection of lightheadedness and felt poorly enough to have to rest the remainder of the day. I am better today and was able to function, but not ready to resume exercise. How many others have had a delayed reaction that is being missed because V Safe stops the follow-up when initial signs &amp; symptoms disappear?

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

Moderna second dose 3/16/21 - same as with first dose for first week.  About 10 days after second dose hallucinations (?); 5:00 am got up, dressed, and walked downstairs asking if I had called the police, because he said I had told him to get up and come downstairs so I could call them.  There were not problems needing the police.  We took it as a very real dream and he went back to bed.  Over the next few weeks, he experienced weakness and dizziness/vertigo  causing three falls.  Went to primary care physician who prescribed Antivert and is sending him for a CAT scan and to a neurologist for further evaluation (vestibuar neuritis?  labyrinthitis?).

The next 1/23 2021 my left leg developed the same problem but more severe.  My gait was severely affected. On 1/24 the right leg was better but  I could hardly put any weight on the left leg in the am hours. In the pm hours both legs got some better. On Monday 1/25 both legs were much better and both finally cleared up on 1/27.

The entire room was spinning and I could hardly walk due to poor balance.  Every time I moved my head, the vertigo would recur.  This caused nausea and vomiting so I spent much of the day in bed.  In the late afternoon, the vertigo lessened after I took an anti-emetic drug.  I only ate clear liquids the first day.  Since then, I have improved but still have mild morning vertigo.and mild fatigue.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

                                                Occasional light dizziness, especially in the morning.  Today, dizziness and weakness has been with me at least 50% of the time.  Seems to be getting worse.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  The patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown) on unknown date. On 29-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029K20A) for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   The patient stated that at some point after receiving the second vaccine, he began experiencing neuropathy that affected his balance and caused tingling.    Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, neuropathy that is affecting his balance and tingling, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He was alert and responsive but extremely bradycardic. The ambulance came and took him away.

The morning after the injection (very painful and I am used to many injections/IVs due to the RA) I had to crawl out my bedroom.  I was unable to walk due the RA  flare.  The staff at the POD indicated this was no different that a usual flu shot. HA!  I had to get a script for Methylprednisolone to alleviate the effects.  The following day I was back to normal.  Again I feel like we (collectively) are not being truthfully being informed.  At best this vaccine is in a raw state, effective I certainly hope so.

                                                Guillain Barre syndrome; He reports that he started to experience tingling of his feet and hands about 6-7 days ago. He came to ED at that time and was given pain medication for his back pain and muscle relaxants, which has since resolved but he feels stiffness in his lower back since then. At that time he was also noted to have low potassium and sodium, reports that he was given IVF and potassium repleted. He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet. Denies difficulty with swallowing, breathing or speech. No shooting pains down his legs, no change in sensation in saddle area, no loss of control of bowel or urinary movements.

Clearly a systemic reaction to the vaccine.  The bursitis in my right shoulder precipitated a cascade of adverse effects that became quite debilitating, and from which I am still recovering. The bursitis in my right knew made squatting difficult for about a week, but that symptom is substantially gone.  Here is the sequence in more detail: Vaccinated (Moderna) on Feb 4; went to play tennis on Feb 10; had discomfort raising my right arm (racquet arm)  when hitting my topspin backhand which has a high follow through ; decided to instead practice slice backhand. Developed acute pain next pain. Could not raise my arm ab ove shoulder for weeks now.

                                                Patient received first COVID vaccine on 2/6/2021 and second vaccine on 3/6/2021. Patient presented to Hospital on 4/09/2021 for persistent nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria and jaundice. Patient reported a 1 month history of intermittent nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, feeling dizzy and weak, poor appetite. Patient had a colonoscopy ~2 weeks prior admission to hospital for cancer screening purposes which was unremarkable and labs done by his primary care at that time were all normal (per admitting physician&#39;s note). At hospital, patient was found to have evidence of hemolytic anemia thought to be autoimmune in nature with a positive direct antiglobulin. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital on 4/11/2021 for further workup. Patient is still currently admitted to hospital. Oncology was consulted for workup of pancytopenia and suspected warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Throughout admission, the patient&#39;s platelets have ranged between 59-154 k/µL and hemoglobin has ranged 4.5-8.6 g/dL with no documented history of thrombocytopenia or anemia. Patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg x9 doses, prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg) x5 doses, prednisone 60 mg x1 dose, rituximab 740 mg (375 mg/m2)  x3 doses, and immune globulin 40 g x3 doses. Patient has also received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Given the timing of anemia and thrombocytopenia and unknown etiology, immune response to his COVID vaccine is on the differential.

                                                Patient received vaccination at clinic and was in the waiting area for the 15 minute monitoring time. About 5 minutes into the waiting time, patient said he was getting light headed. It was noticed he was taking deep, sharp breaths causing his mask to go in his mouth. We switched him to a chair with arms and asked him to remove his jacket and called 911 as a precautionary as the breathing pattern was not improving.  EMS arrived to ask the patient how he was feeling and he said he had a dry mouth and was thirsty. At this time, it was aout 15 minutes after the vaccination. Patient refused transport and asked for water. I asked EMS if that was advisable now that he declined transport and it was beyond the 15 minutes. EMS was still near the patient. Patient was provided water and was able to remove his mask to drink and was much more coherent afterwards. He stayed in the pharmacy area about 20 minutes. He was asked to have his wife drive, which he refused.

                                                Patient was into the clinic yesterday for his first COVID vaccine.  Patient had no contraindications for the vaccine.  Vaccine was administered to right deltoid.  Patient then was asked to sit in the waiting room for 15 minutes for observation.  Patient was sitting in waiting room and developed shortness of breath and dizziness.  Patient vitals signed were obtained blood pressure was elevated 150s/100, heart rate 120s, oxygen level upper 90&#39;s on room air.  Patient was brought to an exam room where he could lay down via wheelchair.  Multiple vital signs were taken during the duration of his time at the clinic.  Blood pressure did come down to 140s/90s, sats remained in  upper 90s, heart rate came down to 70-80.  Patient remained dizzy the entire time.  Patient states that he has a history of idiopathic angioedema as well as a heart stent.  Patient goes on the explain that at different times he can have swelling internally.  He has had this happen several times in the past to his abdomen, saliva glands, tongue, as well as extremities.  Patient and his wife called his primary care physician and MD advised if episode did not resolve to go to the ER.  After waiting in the clinic for around 45 minutes the patients wife decided it would be best to go to the ER.  EMS was notified. Ambulance responded.  Patient was transported via ambulance to ER.    Patient wife was called the afternoon of the incident.  She states that patient was admitted to the hospital for observation.  He was treated with Benadryl, Pepcid, Decadron; CT of head was normal; blood pressure was still elevated; and they were not sure what was the cause of the episode.  I called the patient&#39;s wife on 1-29-21 to check on patient again.  His wife stated that he was been discharged home.  They were unsure what caused the episode and to follow up with primary physician in one week.  She states that at one week follow up visit they would discuss the need/desire for second COVID vaccine.  .

At the night progressed he had muscle weakness, lip tingling, eyelid droop, loss of bowel and bladder function, moreso bladder.  He was slow in his responses, and his wife noticed that was getting weaker and could not get up from the bathroom.  She feels it was more muscle weakness than anything.    On 1/29/21 he was bad most of the day  1/30/21 he started to come out of it little and knew what she was saying.   Now today 2/8/21 he is about 93% back to his baseline.  Nothing taken, but did speak to the doctor and he at that time told him not to take the 2nd vaccine.

                                                Patient was at clinic to receive his 2nd dose of the Moderna CoVID-19 Vaccine.  Approx 13 minutes after receiving the dose, patient became weak, dizzy, and extremely diaphoretic.  Rapid response was called.  Patient was wheeled into exam room.  BG checked immediately and was 110.  Initial vitals showed HR 39 with BP 83/48.  Patient was transferred to exam table w/o incident.  He did not complain of CP or SOB.  Denies any throat swelling or itching.  He felt very weak and tired.  He continued to be extremely diaphoretic.  An 18G IV was introduced to the left forearm without incident.  He was connected to 1 L bag of 0.9% Normal Saline which was hung to bolus, running well without pressure.  EKG obtained and showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 43.  Possible ST changes in V1 and V2, but not diagnostic of ST elevations or depressions.  There is IVCD noted.  Patient has hx of AFib - not in Afib currently.  Reports on Eliquis instead of Coumadin.  EMS was contacted.    Physical exam performed revealed a bradycardic HR which was regular. No murmurs.  Lungs are clear.  Patient is extremely diaphoretic and pale.  He is alert and oriented x 3.  He is not in respiratory distress and shows no signs of oral swelling. No hives noted on his skin.  Vitals were rechecked at 3 mins and showed SaO2 at 95% and then 92%.  NC O2 applied at 2 L/min continuous and there was improvement to 95%.  He still denies any respiratory distress and was not manifesting any signs of respiratory distress.  Still denied any chest pain.  NS continued to infuse at bolus dose and BP recheck improved to 108/65 - patient was lying supine.  HR remained between 40-42.  At this time, the patient reported improved symptoms and he was not sweating as profusely as previously.  At this time EMS arrived.  Atropine was not administered in the clinic, but was prepared in expectation as a possible next step.  As patient&#39;s symptoms improved, but his vital signs remained altered, he was agreeable to transport to the hospital by EMS.  He was placed on stretcher and care was relinquished to EMS team.  Patient transported out of clinic in guarded condition.

Some discomfort but not real pain in upper arm throughout the day, but became really tired later in the day and went to bed early. Got up to use the bathroom at about 11:30pm.  Swung my legs out of bed to the floor and went to stand up but fell forward to the carpet.  I had no strength in my legs or arms.  I laid on the floor about 10 minutes and could not roll over or sit up or get up to my knees.  My wife came around and helped me get up and back on the bed.  She then helped me down the hall to the bathroom, then back to the bedroom.  She helped me back to the bathroom one other time that night.  I stayed in bed for several hours and was very week and mostly sat all day,  I regained my strength over the next three days to where I could stand and walk, although I was very fatigued.  I am now about 9 days later and feel pretty much normal but get fatigued and my balance is not normal.

                                                Injection was given into the deltoid at an almost vertical angle.  After about two hours, and lasting five days, the left arm was extremely sore to the point that assistance was needed to don and remove clothing.  This is considered adverse as compared to the initial injection into the left bicep which resulted in absolutely no side effects.  I believe the location of the second shot drastically effected the outcome.

He fell and there was a loud thump.  When I ran out he was laying on his back and his eyes were open and looked glazed over.  He started talking as soon as I addressed him.  We called 911 because I was concerned of a head injury.  We elevated his feet and had him wait until help came.  He was able to get up and walk out with the policeman and had the paramedics look at him.  I don&#39;t believe he went with them to the hospital.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to be used by the patient within two weeks prior to the event was simvastatin, tadalafil, androgel, prevision, magnesium, vitamin D3, vitamin B12, calcium and fish oil.  On 04-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 Intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19.  On unknown date, the patient experienced sore arm, lightheadness, lasted for 3-4 days and went away.   On unknown date, the patients vitals were checked and the heart rate was elevated to 148 and was admitted to the hospital. EKG and pulse rate was irregular. The patient was diagnosed with A fib. Treatment included apixaban, metoprolol and fluids.  The patient received both doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome for the events, sore arm, lightheadness and A-fib was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On the 4th hole I started feeling light headed and after an hour or so went home and rested.  My resting heart rate after 20 minutes was 88 according to my watch.  It is normally 60-65.  My watch also indicated that my heart rate was 122 while playing golf.  My temperature was 100.5.  After a couple of hours resting my heart rate went down to 75 and temperature lowered to 99.  I felt fine the following morning but my vaccination site turned bright pink and started itching.  This continued for 2 days.  I have had no issues since Friday, March 5th.

                                                I started having severe balance issues on the 10th and rapidly &#34;progressed&#34; to extreme weakness. I could not walk 50 feet to my parked truck without assistance and even that took me about 30 minutes. After getting home I collapsed on the garage floor and it took me 30 minutes to crawl into the house and finally get seated into a chair with the assistance of my wife. The next morning (3/11) I could walk around the house a bit (without walking stick or walker for help) but I am still a bit weaker (than normal). I have had Parkinsons for about two years but I have never had such an instance of weakness or profound immobility. I have not seen my doctor yet and will wait a while to see if conditions worsen.

                                                The day after (3/11/21) the vaccination at 9:30 PM I experienced shakes, as though very cold.  My pulse oximeter showed low blood oxygen (between 80 and 85%) and elevated heart rate (high 70&#39;s/low 80&#39;s).  [I took multiple readings to make sure the numbers were accurate.]  By 10 PM my temperature started to increase rapidly.  Max was around 101.5 to 102F.  Sweat profusely.  By about midnight the fever &#34;broke&#34; (dropped back to normal range).  This will sound odd, but I felt like I had been shown what a severe Covid-19 infection/disease would look like if I were to become seriously ill with the disease.  Felt light-headed on Friday (3/12/21).  [I had no reaction, other than some muscle soreness, from the first dose.The same day as and after the second injection I had soreness in my entire left bicep all day.  No other reactions that day.]

The symptoms became severe enough that he had trouble standing, walking and, ultimately, suffered a fall.  Normally, the subject is able to maintain all functions of independent daily living, exercises regularly and is able to walk more than 5 miles.  These symptoms were also present in similar severity, within a similar time frame after receiving Moderna #1 vaccination. The subject had received a positive test for Covid 19 in late November, 2020 and was largely asymptomatic.
