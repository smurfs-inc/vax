Meclizine and Ondansetron was used immediately.  Scopolamine was prescribed by the physician on 01/08/2021,  picked and used on 01/09/2021; felt better . Residual dizziness remains after use.     P.S. I do have a medical history of BPPV for the last 2-3 years and have been treated for it. Generally speaking my BPPV symptoms resolve themselves quickly after treatment. This current episode has lasted  forthree days.

These symptoms lasted for 48 hours and gradually subsided.  His wife (me) was so frightened that I will not be getting the Moderna series since it&#39;s so dangerous and will caution friends and family as well.

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

Uncomfortable but never to the point of difficulty breathing. ~08:30, BP 128/99 (I think) Systolic up only a bit.  Diastolic very high for me sent to urgent care part of clinic.   Monitored BP, oxygen, did EKG (normal), symptoms started easing ~ 09:40.  Sent home. Attending PA though it might just be a Vaso-Vagel response, but, after hundreds upon hundred of needles, I&#39;ve never had such a response, and, my symptoms did not involve a low BP, fainting or nausea, rather I remained conscious, had throat constriction with increased BP and a narrowed pulse pressure  range.

                                                From day 2-5 I had symptoms similar to a shoulder rotator cuff injury where I could not raise my arm on its own, had very restricted range of motion, sharp pain when moving the arm. Had two Tylenol (500 Mg) one on the afternoon and one at night day 2, then 1 in the morning,2 at night day 3 and found I got no relief. Then the arm slowly improved on its own. Back to normal after 8-10 days.   I believe the injection site may have been too high up on the arm close to the shoulder. The dose was administered.

By the time I saw him on 3/23/21 the leg discomfort and foot drop had mostly resolved but was still present.  Denies trauma or any other sxs.

The second Covid 19 Vaccine on 2/05/2021 went the same but after approximately two weeks I noticed soreness between my miidle and ring finger on my left hand along with soreness but thought nothing of it. the Pain eventually got worse. I went to my doctor on 3/25/2021 and was prescribed Naproxin and Voltaren Gel. The discomfort in my left had continues continues. There is selling above this area and the inside of my hand below those fingers hurts and my hand when I close it feels tight and this I atribute to the swelling. My doctor ran labs and all were negative even for Gout. There is a dense feeling in my left upper arm that comes and goes and some tingling. My left hand will have a burning feeling on the ring finger knuckle and experience pain when I fully open my hand. I have not injured my left hand in any way. I find it very unusual because I am right handed. I would appreciate any assistant if possible. I can send photographs if needed of my hand.

Symptoms of greatest concern: Nausea, Headache, Chills for 1-2 days; and the ongoing Fatigue is now in its 4th day.  Details of symptoms with time of onset, duration and severity are provided below (Note: Injection with 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine took place at 9:24AM on 07APR21):  07APR21, 10:30AM ? Arm Pain: Onset of mild pain in arm that was noticed when not touching the arm; Level of pain was a ?1? out of 10).  An annoying level of pain where the pain ramped up to 3 or 4 on a scale of 10 when the arm was moved about began at 7:00PM on 07APR21 and lasted 12 hours until 7:00AM on 08APR21.  The pain diminished to a mild ache for another 33 hours until it became insignificant by 4:00PM on 09APR21.  07APR21, 1:00PM ? Dry Eyes: Onset of an intermittent feeling of very dry eyes that lasted approximately 1-2 hours at a time and continued over a period of 9 hours until 10PM on 07APR21.  07APR21, 3:30PM - Fatigue: Onset of mild fatigue that steadily increased until bedtime at 10:00PM on 07APR21; and was significantly more pronounced at 1:00AM on 08APR21 (was difficult to stand and walk 20? to closet to obtain a thermometer; could not walk straight and bumped into hallway on left 4-5 times).  Fatigue was rather frightening and severe from 3:00AM to 3:30AM on 08APR21 when I crawled to the bathroom, but could not get off my knees and collapsed on the floor until I could return to bed by crawling on the floor.  Was able to stand again at 7:00AM on 08APR21 and walked (slowly) 30? to a sofa.  Slept from 10PM on 07APR21 to 1:00AM on 08APR21; 4:00-7:30AM on 08APR21; 8:30-10:30AM on 08APR21; 11:00AM to 3:00PM on 08APR21; 7:00PM on 08APR21 to 3:00AM on 09APR21; 3:30AM to 7:30AM on 09APR21; 9:30PM on 09APR21 to 9:15AM on 10APR21; 6:40PM on 10APR21 to 7:00AM on 11APR21.  Ongoing weariness continues as I write this at 11:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Nausea: Onset of continuous nausea that lasted 13 hours and 20 minutes until 08APR21, 8:30AM. Nausea was particularly bad with intermittent dry heaves for the 7.5 hours lasting from 1:00AM to 8:30AM on 08APR21; Nausea then came in waves for 23 more hours until 09Apr21, 7:30AM when it was finally gone.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Headache: Onset of headache that has lasted 4 days (as of 11APR21, 10:30AM). Finally gave in and took one extended release tablet of 650mg Acetaminophen tablet about 25 hours after the vaccination (i.e., took painkiller at 10:30AM on 08APR21).  Took two Ibuprofen at 9:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Chills: Onset of chills that increased to intermittent shivering by bedtime at 10PM on 07APR21. Awoke at 1:00AM on 08APR21 and could not get warm.  Two hours later, at 3:00AM, I felt completely opposite and could not feel cool.  These symptoms gradually subsided and were gone by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Joint Pain and Muscle Aches: Onset of joint pain and muscle aches that occasionally became annoying with twinges of pain. These symptoms subsided by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Dizziness: Onset of mild dizziness that lasted 12 hours until 7:15AM on 08APR21.  08APR21, 1:00AM ? Measured Fever: Decided to measure temperature due to significant chills and shivering and found temperature was 101.0 at 1:00AM on 08APR21.  At 3:00PM on 08APR21, my temperature was 100.2 (this was 4.5 hours after taking one extended release tablet of 650mg acetaminophen).  At 3:00AM on 09APR21, my temperature measured 98.6 degrees and has remained near there ever since.  09APR21, 4:00PM ? Arm Rash: First noticed presence of a rash measuring about 2? x 3? on upper arm near the area that received the injection.  Mild itchiness was present about an hour later and a topical 2% diphenhydramine gel was applied.  The rash had dissipated by 5PM on 10APR21.

                                                I was extremely tired on Saturday. My shoulder hurt. About 3 pm, while urinating, I felt very light-headed as if I was about to faint. I stopped urinating and went back to bed.  That evening, about 8:30, I tried to eat dinner, but after three bites, I felt extremely tired. I leaned back in my chair, and I passed out. My wife woke me, but it took several minutes. She said my eyes rolled back in my head. She splashed water on my face. She said that I stopped breathing.  I woke up, then pushed my plate away and put my head on the table. I could not hold it up. I was sweating profusely. After several minutes, I felt that I was about to have diarrhea. My daughter and wife tried to walk me to the bathroom, but I did not have the energy to get there. I collapsed in the hall and hit my head on the door jamb. After several minute of trying , they pulled me up, and I then got the strength to walk the rest of the way. I had diarrhea, not suddenly, but it was as if my GI system emptied. It was soft, not loose, and there was a lot.  I went back to bed, and eventually slept.  I felt queasy the next day (Sunday), and I felt lightheaded at times, so I just sat or laid down. But I was feeling better. Today (Monday) I feel much better. A little tired, but much better. I went to the Pharmacy this morning, and they referred me to this website. I did not see the doctor.

                                                In summary this is a 60 year old male who was normal functioning presenting to hospital 4 days following second moderna COVID-19 vaccination with AKI, Rhabdomyolsis, Confusion/Delirium with agitation, multiple acute brain infarcts, DVT, and multilobar pulmonary embolism.  24 hours following vaccination patient began to become slightly confused while driving his wife to her vaccine appointment.  Symptoms progressed and included severe fatigue and muscle aches.  Patient was taking tizanidine and oxycodone to manage muscle / body aches which had been prescribed for his chronic back pain issues.  Patient was noted to be excessively sleeping, and also had fallen twice between vaccination and hospital presentation. 4 days following vaccination he presented to the emergency department with severe lethargy and confusion.  He was admitted with presumption of overdose of medication, given activated charcoal.  A CT of the head (4/11/2021) was completed which demonstrated No acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection or acute territorial infarct. Suggestion of a chronic lacunar infarct involving the left lentiform nucleus. Regions of low attenuation involving the cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left, which, allowing for image degradation secondary to patient motion artifact, are likely artifactual in nature; follow-up is recommended to assess for stability/resolution.For first several days patient suffered delirium with agitation, he was disoriented to place and time.  CK on admission, 4/11/2021, was 17,086, indicating rhabdo.  Creatinine on admission was 4.39, indicating new acute renal failure. Liver enzymes were elevated with AST of 477 and ALT of 218. PT was 10.6, INR 0.99.  ABG demonstrated metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.22, co2 45, HCO3 18.4.  Over several days his mentation improved however was noted to still need light supplemental oxygenation.  Because of the delirium a brain MRI was completed on 4/13/2021, which demonstrated acute ischemic infarcts on DWI sequence noting bilateral, right greater than left, acute cerebellar infarcts. Small acute lacunar infarcts at bilateral basal ganglia/genu internal capsule.  Due to the infarcts a stroke workup was completed. Carotid duplex was performed and notable for only small bilateral carotid plaque.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable.  A CTA of the chest was completed on 4/15/2021 for continued hypoxemia, need for nasal cannula to maintain spo2 saturation.  Findings included multilobar pulmonary embolism.  Venous duplex dopplers of the lower extremities were also completed on 4/15/2021 demonstrated an isolated left popliteal vein DVT. No evidence of right leg DVT.  Over several days CK and Cr returned to baseline / normal levels.  He remains hospitalized and is still undergoing treatment.

                                                Within an hour or two of the vaccine second dose every area where I have ever had joint problems gave me problems. The worst was the arthritis in my left thumb, which also suffers from Carpal tunnel. My thumb where I do have arthritis became so painful and sensitive to any movement that I could not use it. At one point the pain took me to my knees. I now think that the far above average pain in that joint that I have been having for  several weeks  may have been from the first dose but the extreme increase in pain right after the vaccine seems very likely to be the vaccine. I also had painful electric like jolts in my back and ankle and have been experiencing higher than normal chest, center of rib cage pain. All these areas are problem spots for me but for all of them to flare up at once right after the vaccine is unprecedented as was the pain in my left wrist/thumb.

                                                Dizziness or lightheadedness after taking a shower.  Was not very severe and I was able to drive to work.  The dizziness lasted most of the morning and became less noticeable as the day went on.  By 5:00 pm it was hardly noticeable at all.  The morning of day 2 there was a slight dizziness still present.  As of today I think I am fine, but still feel some dizziness at odd times. The one other event worth noting is that during the vaccination, when extracting the needle from my arm there was a significant amount of blood that came out of the injection site as if the needle had penetrated a blood vessel during administration.

I gave him his vaccine and upon standing was a little dizzy/light headed. I asked him to sit down and I asked if he had any other symptoms. He did not. He said he felt ok sitting so I asked him if he wanted an orange juice to bump up his sugar level. He agreed and I gave him a bottle. He drank it down, as I continued to monitor him. After about 10 min or so he said he was feeling better, I asked him to stay another 20min or so just to monitor him. After that time was up I went out to him to check him again. He said he felt fine and left. His wife and family was with him.

Had decreased strength and sensitivity in extremities and Babinski&#39;s were upward going.  Discharged to home without medication and to F/U  with PCP in 4-6 days.  Saw PCP on 4/20/21. He had S&amp;G hyeresthesia, &#43; Rhomberg, failed tandem walk, and dysdiadochokinesia.  Neuropatic pain in shoulders, arms, legs, hands, and feet with weakness in hands and arms and sensory loss in left leg.  Was unable to get immediate MRI so patient was admitted directly to hospital.  MRI showed concern for transverse myelitis felt to be secondary to Covid 19 vaccine.  He will not get second dose.  Improved to near baseline with treatment of high dose steroids.  He also had an STEMI and was taken to the Cath lab where they found 50% blockage in a coronary artery.  They felt STEMI was caused by spasm.  Pt was discharged home on 4/26/21 and is having physical therapy to help regain his mobility.

                                                Couple days after 1st shot I started to feel tightness in upper back and then it started to bother  my right hand.  The pain would wake me up at night a couple of times- I would take extra strength tylenol and use a vibrator on it. Just before the 2nd shot I started to feel a little better. After the 2nd shot it made both my arms hurt but mostly my hands. I also had pain and difficulty raising and lowering my arms. Went to see my doctor; P.A. on 4/29/21 because my right hand was swollen. A blood panel was taken and results were good. Was prescribed Cadista-MethylPrednisolone 4mg.

A few minutes after taking the vaccine, blood pressure fell, dizzy with risk of passing out, weak, very rapid heart beat, nausea. Jumped up and starting moving to create energy to avoid passing out. The dizziness reduced somewhat and did not get worse, but was still present. Heart rate slowed after a significant period of time. Then symptoms resolved. No emotional triggers and no history of any such events at any time in 60 years.

You just lie there, hot, and ache all over, then this wave of chills hits for maybe 5 seconds then dissipates. The 2 mins later, it happens again! And this goes on for  an hour or more! I had to pee but was worried I?d be too cold to stand still. So I waited until I could not wait anymore. OMG! Trying to stand up! It?s as if my joints no longer worked! And when I did stand up I was dizzy as hell! The next day, utter exhaustion. I am so weak, it takes effort to move. Even breathing took work! I didn?t sleep all night as every position I lay in was uncomfortable and had twinges of chills. The amount of energy it takes to physically get up and walk to the bathroom is dumbfounding! This morning I am achy, hot and cold, exhausted, and just had a bout of dry heaves. I?m hoping to be able to get some sleep today.

I mostly recovered after a couple of days, but still have some headache.  Then yesterday, 6 days after injection, I started experiencing vertigo. It is like my vision is shifting quickly and I lose my balance. It happened yesterday morning when I first woke up, and cleared up in a minute. Then it happened again in the afternoon when we were on a long hike, and I fell into some bushes. Last night it happened 3 more times as I awoke from sleep.

On 6/5 He awoke at 3:00 a.m.  in the setting of leg cramps.  He got out of bed to walk off the cramps, but then developed substernal chest pain.  He describes the pain as ?squeezing? and cramping with radiation towards the left shoulder.  He began to feel lightheaded and diaphoretic, and thus began driving himself to the ED.  On the way, he felt his symptoms were worsening so he called dispatch he recommended he pull over at a nearby gas station.  EMS met him there and transported him the rest of the way to the ED. In the outside ED, he was initially hypertensive to 175/99.

                                                He got his vaccine, had extreme pain in his right arm.  He went back to the pharmacy and let her know that it hurt for several days and then went away, and he is still having the tenderness in the arm.  It was so painful that he could not sleep on it due to the pain.   He then had no problems up until 5/24/21 when he noticed some swelling on his ankle of his right leg.  He put it in cold water to see if the swelling would go down and it did not.  Then he didn&#39;t think about it again until it was stiff, swollen and wanted to turn to the right side and hard for him to drive and taking his anti-inflammatories.  It progressively got worse and around 5/25/21 the swelling was severe and doubled in size and getting worse and on 6/3/21 he could not get his pants off due to the swelling and he went to the Dr. The next day.  He had pain behind the knee, ankle, pain in the leg.  He went to the doctor, and they sent him to the ER for an US which showed DVT of the right leg.  He was informed that it was large and that it was in the thigh of his right leg and not returning blood to his heart.  He was put on Eliquis 5 mg twice a day and is doing well for him.  The swelling is a little better, the ankle is still swollen, and the leg is still swollen, the top of his foot is really bad, front of his leg and thigh.  The knee does not seem to be swollen, but the thigh is.   He has no problem with the left side.  He is to follow up with his doctor on Thursday.  He is on Hydrocodone as well for the pain as needed for his neck pain and lower back.

I had the second dose on 4/28/2021 my arm was still sore from the first shot. Seemed like the second shot did not hurt at all compared to the first shot. How long will the the pain continue? Who do I see for this? My pcp said to just keep an eye on the situation.

This has not completely gone away since onset on 1/21/2021.  I began having &#34;floaters&#34; in my vision beginning about 8am following vaccine.  This has not gone away.  I did have a bout of vertigo in January 2020, that had not reoccurred since that time.  I have not had &#34;floaters&#34; prior to the 2nd dose of the vaccine.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

Moved to Tendonitis/Arthritis wrists, hands, fingers and Left patellar knee tendon. SLOWLY improved but did not leave, despite treatment with Aleve, until 2nd vaccine 2/5/2021. Then, same symptoms worsened and included BOT patellar tendons, nd plantar tendons. Continues to present and are very painful at night, despite 2 Aleve BID daily, and  cannot make fist or extend fingers on  both hands and cannot walk on feet without pain at MTP&#39;s. Discussed with orthopedic surgeon who assured me that I was having &#34;an immune reaction in tendons to vaccine. It should get better over time&#34;. It has not at present.

Jogged for 60 minutes, returned, ate and rested again.  4th day, felt much better, no dizzyness, still a little tired but maybe 85% energy level.  5th day back to normal.

While in bathroom, became dizzy, broke into sweats, and felt I was about to faint. I went to my knees holding onto counter. My wife came in to help me in bathroom. She observed I was incoherent but uttering moaning sounds and breathing heavily. She called 911. While on phone I came to and vomited into sink. It appeared I had not digested anything from dinner that night. After vomiting (1x) I felt much better.  First responders reported normal vital signs. I did not go to E.R. that night but went to Urgent Care later that morning and all seemed fine.

My wife sad she heard a loud noise and came into the bathroom to see what had happened. She called my daughter and son-in law to come over and get me up I couldn&#39;t move at the time, I must have hit my back and neck because they are sore. Then Saturday night I had sweats all night, today I fell a little better except for my back and neck, I have a doctor&#39;s app. Friday. I am concerned about the 2nd shot if the 1st shot did this to me.

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

                                                After feeling well and dinner I passed out. I came to after a minute or so. Everything was spinning and I was sweating profusely and had pretty strong chills and shivering. I stood on the floor until I felt better. I was able to go upstairs and I went to bed. I did continue to shiver for about 15 minutes. I have felt ok since then. I am not sure if I will get the second dose after that experience.

                                                I woke at 4:30 AM and spent the next SEVEN HOURS explosively vomiting and diarrheic. Muscle pain and tightness spread from my left shoulder, across my back, to my right shoulder. Lying flat gave me dry heaves. Standing up made me dizzy. I?m coughing like there is fluid at the bottom of my lungs. The base of my skull felt like it was in a C-clamp. My temples felt like they were in a vise. I have a rash on my shoulder and arm. I  smelled like rotting flesh. (To head off any concerns over lifestyle or hygiene, I have a BA, BFA, MBA, MSL, and completing my PhD.)  After two days of exhaustion, vomiting, diarrhea, pain, etc. I took a shower at 11:58 PM Saturday. When I swiped my soapy face towel over my left should, I wiped away a layer of skin, like a burn victim.  Be grateful I don?t have power. I would stop the Moderna injections until someone finds out what it is about my genetic makeup that might signal those with similar genetics to stay clear of Moderna.

He then started nodding in and out of consciousness and stating that he did not know where he was and that he just needed to rest and lie down. He repeatedly attempted to stand but was kept sitting. During this, myself and his girlfriend kept trying to engage him in conversation and keep him awake. Shortly after the EMTs came and attempted to talk to him. Blood Pressure and temperature were taken (I am not aware of the readings) and he eventually agreed to go to a hospital. He was taken out of the building on a stretcher.

                                                He just told me yesterday that the day after he got his second moderna injection both feet swelled up. Severely ! He complained of not being able to move his toes etc. There is no pain or trauma. just ironically it happened the day after his injection. He will not go see a doctor yet because he thinks it will go away. He started wearing compression stockings the day before  last and it has helped.  I am worried that he has a blood clot but he  thinks that it woudn&#39;t be in both feet. Not sure if it matters but he is a 61 year old man .  with no known co morbities. Is this a side effect that has been recorded? I am concerned but dealing with a stubborn man.

                                                On June 1, I was hospitalized for pancreatitis although I had none of the preexisting conditions for it such as a history of drinking alcohol or anything else that the hospital could find.  Next on June 16, I began feeling lightheaded.  I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a specialist.  After some testing, Doctor informed me that my heart was beating lower than the normal range.  I just had a heart stress test done a few years earlier and my heart was more than fine.  It is hard for me to understand how my heart health could have such a dramatic reversal so quickly.

                                                I had all the typical previously reported symptoms up to the point when getting first injection as mentioned in print and on the news.   Headaches,  body aches and some dizziness.   They occurred shortly after the injection (within the first 3 days)  But,  i noticed (just like mentioned in the news now) that about 2 weeks after getting the 1st injection my chest had a odd &#34;pressure&#34; feeling.   Like something wasn&#39;t right in there.   At the time my work was from home that week so it wasn&#39;t a problem to just &#34;take it easy&#34; instead of doing anything strenuous.   And in a week or so afterwards it went away totally and I felt confident that the 2nd shot would be ok to take.     The 2nd shot had less side effects other than some minor dizziness that subsided within the first week totally.   The 2nd week did not have the first shots pressure feeling on my chest like my body had adjusted to getting the shot in some way.     Since  I have gotten both shots though it seems there is the intermittent &#34;dizziness&#34; that doesn&#39;t affect my thinking or motor functions in any way.   There just seems to be times where I feel &#34;funny&#34;  nothing that is adverse or causes driving or walking issues (motor functions).    It&#39;s just noticeable at times.

Similar to my 1st vaccine 4 weeks earlier, except this time my elbow joint had some soreness.  The soreness and swelling continued to get worse throughout the day and could not sleep well that night.  The following day I woke up with a painful and swollen elbow joint, and still had soreness around the injection point.  By the afternoon I could not move or extend my left arm with severe pain.  The swelling and pain increased and Advil or ice was not effective in reducing these symptoms.  The pain and swelling got so severe and I could no longer tolerate the pain and went to Urgent Care. I continue to experience left elbow joint pain, and now experience similar joint swelling and pain in my ankle and knee.  It&#39;s not as severe and painful as my left elbow joint.   I am making this report now because 2 days ago I started to develop the same symptoms in my right elbow joint and leg/hip joint, and now I can barely walk.  The joint pain is severe so I will seek medical treatment today.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.

I moved to a reclining chair and stayed there 20&#43; hours (it&#39;s 20 now)... I got up to go to the bathroom and not much more.  I had a difficult time even making it to the bathroom.  Never had a fever (that I know of... I don&#39;t have a thermometer but didn&#39;t feel feverish or chilled), but I felt dizzy and nauseated all day and could hardly move from the recliner except for extreme need.

Started seeing stars, vision narrowing.  I laid down on the floor, and it seemed like I was having a hard time breathing.  The pharmacist came out and started talking to me. My wife happened to be there and was trying to calm me down.  I felt like I was passing out.  The pharmacist checked my BP and it was like 80 something.  He felt I was having an allergic reaction so gave me a show with an Eppy pen.  They called paramedics.  I started feeling better but paramedics said I should still go to ER so ambulance took me to ER.  They ran blood tests, EKG, and chest Xray.  After a few hours they released me.  They basically said that it was ok for me to get second shot, but obviously I am now extremely concerned out about getting it

                                                After receiving the first Moderna vaccination in my Left arm, I started feeling pain in the area of the vaccination site on the evening of 03/22/21. As time progressed I started to realize I was losing all motion in my arm and weakness on my entire left side of my body, but assumed this was a side-effect of the vaccination .  I was not concerned until my wife alarmed me in the morning when she looked at me and noticed the left side of my face drooped and had that I had difficulty standing, no balance, little use of my left leg and no use of my left arm and hand.  At that point, 7:00am 03/23/21, my wife drove me to the ER.  I was admitted and an inpatient for 15 days including PT/OT/ST therapies at the hospital for Stroke.

                                                When I woke up, my entire body felt really bloated and soar. Moderate headache. Dizzy, could not think. Walking very slow. No desire to do anything. Sat in my recliner most of the morning with body aches and sleeping. In the early afternoon, I decided to go lay down in my bed to get more comfortable. Continued drinking water throughout the day. Woke up about 7:00 PM. As I got out of bed, I immediately noticed that I was feeling about 80-90% better. The whole body bloating feeling was gone. Body aches were very reduced. Headache was very minor. I felt like a different person when I woke up (better). Very freaky feeling! I was also able to eat some good at this time.

Worked that day and went home, woke up around 2 am with sweats and nausea and headache which became progressively worse through the day prohibiting any activity. Dry heaves and severe headache with dizziness lasted until 4 pm or so. I did take Ondansetron at 12 noon to limit nausea. Worked the following day with few physical symptoms but very irritable. The next day (Saturday) woke with headache and slight nausea which became worse as the day wore on, limiting activity but I was able to get chores done, though I was very lethargic. The next day was much better. Worked on Monday the 12th of April and felt well. Fell ill again with similar but less severe symptoms, though marked nausea and dry heaving again. Slept until approximately 2pm and started writing this report. 4/13/2021

                                                Several days prior to the shot, I had been experiencing sore, muscle-related pain in my neck, especially the left side and shoulder area, making it difficult to turn my head to the left. I was still experiencing this pain at the time of the shot. The evening of receiving the shot, I awoke at about 11:30 p.m. with extreme pain in my left shoulder (would describe as 8 on scale of 1 to 10)...not sure I could even get out of bed. Was able to &#34;walk it off&#34; and went back to bed, but had the same pain and difficulty getting out of bed twice more that night. Once prone, the pain would eventually subside. Went to work that morning (the day after receiving the shot) but returned home after an hour as I had a mild fever (100.1) and chills. I took 2 Ibuprofen and slept for about 2 hours. I awoke with temperature down to 99.7 and less pain in the left shoulder/arm area. Throughout the day, my temperature continued to go down and the chills lessened. Two days later, I have no fever and mild pain at injection site.

Does not carry epi pen with him though he has been prescribed one in past.             Vaccine administered 10:02am. Immediately after vaccine patient reported dizziness that persisted for about 60 min. He reports similar if less severe dizziness after flu vaccine one month ago and that he often feels dizzy after taking his morning dose of nortryptiline which he took today.            Symptoms evolved to include mild nausea, feeling that abdomen was &#34;shaking&#34;, and headache. No SOB or chest pain, feeling of throat closing, or rash. Patient AO x 3 throughout evaluation and talking throughout.             Fasting BG 234. Took basalglar 40u this AM and 5 of aspart. Drank 8oz chocolate milk 9:30am which is his typical breakfast.             He notes that his home BP this past week was elevated into SBP 170s though typically is in the 120s/70s without antihypertensive medications. Prolonged dizziness and hyperglycemia (454). Regular insulin 5u SQ administered. Patient symptoms after 60 min. Repeat BG essentially unchanged but patient symptomatically back to prevaccine baseline.   Discussed with ID on call. Plan for transport to SMMC lab for CH50 and tryptase with instructions to patient to repeat in more than 24 hours (to establish a baseline). Patient given strict ED precautions.

Slightly itchy and started out smaller circles then bigger.  Once it got bigger it actually stopped itching but he also states that he used cortisone cream for itch.  He says he may be a little bit dizzy but he sometimes gets dizzy even before the vaccine.  He states &#34;no other symptoms&#34; and rash is getting better.  He is concerned whether or not he should have the second dose of Moderna Vaccine.

Patient&#39;s daughter thinks diffuse or migrating arthralgias started about 4 days after the vaccine was given.  He visited ED on 3/09 complaining of pain in multiple joints for 3 weeks.  No labs were done then.  He returned 3/19 with difficulty walking and talking, was sent to SNF after MRI with diagnosis (probably incorrect) of acute cerebral infarct.  He returned to the ED on 3/29 less alert, and no longer able to speak.  LP showed 10 WBC (mostly lymphs) and protein 70.  MRI was repeated, looked similar to previous scan , but reinterpreted as diffuse cerebritis, worst in basal ganglia.   By 4/02 he was deeply obtunded ... (cont. on next page)

I do not believe that I will be able to duplicate what I previously wrote before being timed out. I will do the best I can. To the best of my recollection and ability. NOTE: Automatic Wrist BP readings (also takes pulse) closely follows manually-taken Stethoscope Sphygmomanometer readings. 4/22/21 Doing active range of motion pre and post injection. 7:45pm Signs &amp; Symptoms (S/S) Mild - arm discomfort w/swelling, fatigue, lightheadedness, and body ache. Ice- alternating periods of 15 minutes on, then off - done several times. Lessen arm discomfort, no redness noted. Slow increase S/S through night. 4/23/21 mid afternoon- marked increase S/S plus start sporadic flush feeling, noted 1 x 1 inch oval red area over site. 8pm- Increased &amp; more constant flushed. Temp 98.9 F. Noted marked increase body ache, first moving across chest, then descending to both toes/feet. 9pm- Temp 100.4 F. Monitoring temp, hoping peaked. 9:30pm 99.9 F- 9:50pm Felt very dizzy, self-palpated pulse- felt weaker than my normal, noted more distended veins on arms. Asked wife to get pulse oximeter- sat/pulse ranging 93-97, depending on finger, hand, how long on each; noted amplitude lower than my normal; 82-86 range pulse. 9:53pm Obtained BP R wrist supine 105/61 Pulse 82. Felt too dizzy for BP to be done in sitting. BP confirmed by second reading. BP wrist supine sys about 30 -35 &amp; diastolic about 10-20 below baseline. 9:56pm Took 1000mg Acetaminophen. 11pm Temp less than 99, marked decrease head to toe pain, more towards my mild lightheadedness at times due to my mild TB baseline. Able to ambulate. 4/23/21 4-5 am Temp low 98 range (more my normal). 7am BP L wrist supine 135/70 Pulse 69. Sat 98 reading obtained very quickly, pulse amplitude more my normal. Feeling better but not to Pre-vax. Repeated BP &amp; Sat readings twice during the rest of date. Don?t recall time of 1st BP 135/70 Pulse 70 &amp; Sat 96/Pulse 69, noted injection site redness. 9:30pm- started having headaches, pain on L side head (near site of my head wound/mild TBI site), slight increase lightheadedness, injection site red area increased in pain &amp; size to covering almost full deltoid area. BP 125/73 Pulse 65 Sat 97/ Pulse 65. Both Sat numbers obtained very quickly, as per my normal. Ice used. Alleviated pain to tolerable. Monitoring size of red area &amp; intensity/duration of lightheadedness. Recall a strong tingling sensation going down my left arm once. Noted change in sensation afterwards. Slight increase lightheadedness felt due to what usually happens in change in weather, like rain coming. Rain occurred. 4/25/21- Basically the peripheral of deltoid showing redness with some scattered redness centrally. At 8pm redness fully covering deltoid area. Will continue to monitor (&#34;Covid arm&#34;). Other than fatigue thought due to vax, NO S/S of markedly reduce platelets. If need be, will contact Teledoc. Have prior training as a respiratory therapist &amp; occupational therapist.

Had a virtual visit with my doctor who said to take Dramamine for the dizziness. I was not feeling less dizzy until Wednesday afternoon (4/20/2021) - I am still slightly dizzy if I move my head too quickly. I have an appointment with my doctor for later this week.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Pain, Rash, Panic attack (2 episodes) and Anxiety. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: PREDNISONE (for 6 days). Concomitant products included PREDNISONE for Pain and Rash, METHYLPREDNISOLONE (MEDROL DOSEPAK) for an unknown indication.    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking), GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse). At the time of the report, POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse) had not resolved and HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Since the patient&#39;s first dose of the Moderna vaccine, he had not been on prednisone the whole time but was recently put on a Medrol pack. He was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica as his pain became more consistent after the first dose of the vaccine. His pain is in his arm and shoulders, his left hip hurt and he was not able to lift his arm all the way up.  The patient believed that the vaccine may had caused an inflammatory reaction that aggravated his pain that was present before the vaccine. The patient also stated there was a time that he was not able to get out of bed, he was shaking, and had to use a cane to walk. He says he never had joint pain, only stiffness when waking up and soreness in his hip and leg that was painful. After the vaccine, his arm hurt to the extent he could not sleep on it and the pain in his legs had worsened. He makes it very clear he had a lot of pain prior to the vaccine, but the pain he was experiencing now is more consistent.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Following first shot, I had really bad joint and muscle pain around joints. Took hot showers for pain and Tylenol. Pain in right shoulder (where I have something else going on) increased a lot. After the second shot (about 3 days later), joint and muscle pain returned in all joints. Now, May 9th, joint pain is really bad in arms, hips and legs. It is difficult to walk and to raise arms. I haven&#39;t slept due to severe pain. I hope this subsides. I will give it a few more days but it&#39;s very painful.

Since then I&#39;ve had regular headaches and an ongoing sense of subtle lightheadedness. The dizziness returns if I move my head too drastically, particularly if I lie down quickly in certain directions. If I am careful through the day I am not dizzy but there&#39;s the lightheadedness. Existing tinnitus also seems aggravated.

Does not allow me to lift arms or stretch legs due to crazy pain. Can hardly lift blankets off me in morning. Movement helps and I loosen up by late afternoon, but the evening tightens me up again. Acute pain ranging to 8 or 9 on a scale of 10. Tried Advil 4x per day. Helped me maintain, but never took pain away. Went to Rheumatology Clinic, took many labs and x-rays. Gave me prednisone. Worked day 1, then back to acute pain that continues to keep me sleepless.

On 4/11/2021, I awoke to excruciating, bilateral pain in my hips and shoulders. I could walk only with difficulty and I had trouble dressing myself. This pain persisted for days and, after testing to rule out Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis, I saw rhematologist Dr. at Health Center on 5/5/2021. She diagnoses me as suffering from PolyMyalgia Rheumatica and prescribes MethylPrednisolone 16mg.  Over the course of a few days, the pain subsided and I remain on this dose of MethylPrednisolone today and continue to see Dr. monthly to track the status of my Polymyalgia Rheumatica.  She suggested that I post my experience on VAERS because she has seen some other instances of Polymyalgia Rheumatica proximal to the Covid vaccine.

                                                It&#39;s interesting as a non-medical person, the struggle I&#39;m having, to get one person to just understand the period of time that I&#39;ve seen different providers. Since my second injection I had suffered from ongoing problems, I have days where I can just hardly stay awake. I have never felt like there was a single medical professional who was trying to even find out what was going on with me. On May 28th I woke up in the morning at 2:30AM with an extreme case of dizziness and nausea. I got up and went to the bathroom and went back to the bed thinking I could go back to sleep. It was as if I had some type of horrible severe hangover or something, but I did not. About an hour later I got up, fell on the floor, then decided I had to go see somebody. I called the ambulance and was taken to the ER, where they ran lots of tests. The diagnosis was that I had severe peripheral vertigo. and prescribed medications for that. So in June 2021 I went to the DR for a stress test and echocardiogram and those came back fine. I get mild nausea and dizziness still but nothing like had happened originally. I had visited PCP, my DR, after my visit to the ER and she is the only one kind enough to me to care. I have had an ongoing effect on my ability to function so when I got the v-safe check in, of course I replied that I have had an event of course. Ondansetron 8MG as needed for nausea Meclizine 25MG as needed for dizziness, these are the medications they gave me at the ER by the way.

                                                Patient was given the vaccine at approximately 11:40 am by technician. The patient was advised to wait for 15 minutes in the waiting area after the vaccination was given. During the 15 minute waiting period the patient fainted in the waiting area of the pharmacy. The patient was immediately assisted. The technicians were told to call 911 and management. Upon encountering the patient, the patient was gently rubbed and asked if he could hear me. The patient was immediately responsive and told me his name and date of birth. The patient was asked if he had any health conditions or prior incidents of fainting after a vaccination and the patient stated &#34;no&#34;. The patient was provided water and asked if he could sit up. The patient stated that he could. The patient sat on the floor in an upright position for approximately ten minutes. The patient was then asked if he felt that he could stand to get back into the chair. The patient sat back in the chair and continued to drink water and take deep breaths. The patient stated that he still felt dizzy and nauseous. The patient&#39;s emergency contact was contacted to inform of the situation. EMT arrived at approximately 12:15 pm. Patient was asked by EMT&#39;s if he wanted to go to the hospital. The patient responded &#34;no&#34;. The patient was then asked if they could &#34;check him out&#34; and he agreed. After assessing the patient the patient was taken to the hospital by ambulance.

                                                Patient was monitored for 1 hour after receiving his vaccine as requested by his primary care provider due to history of reaction to a previous vaccine. Patient monitored by EMS provider x 1hr, no s/s adverse reaction. Patient started walking out of facility on his own and came back reporting he felt dizzy. He was initially hypertensive with a pulse of 70, respiratory rate 12, systolic BP 188.  We had him lay down and about 10 minutes later his blood pressure was 140/70.   After another 10 minutes or so we had him sit and drink water but his dizziness, while improved, did not go away and he started to have chills and was visibly shaking so 911 was called as we did not feel he could drive himself home. Patient was monitored in the emergency department at Hospital x 1hr and released with blood pressure WNL.

I did not fall. I stumbled into the bathroom, still unsteady. I urinated sitting down, still feeling unsteady, head spinning. I took my blood pressure 130/70, which is normal. Was feeling steadier. Was able to walk down stairs to ground floor of home. Still not felling normal, but steady on my feet. After eating breakfast, no additional symptoms through day. I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages over the past week. When I went to bed Sat night, lying in bed I was light headed. Sunday morning same problems. I performed some vehicle maintenance and would get down on the ground. Head would start spinning, everything would return to normal once standing. At bedtime same feelings when lying down in bed. Monday morning (today) same problems.

His symptoms persisted throughout the night into the next day (3/10/21), and he went to his primary care physician. He vomited multiple times in transport and at the physician&#39;s office. Due to the nature of his symptoms and his concurrent hypertension there was concern for stroke and he was taken to the emergency department at Medical Center for evaluation around 4pm. Stroke was ruled out, and he was sent home with a prescription for meclizine with a presumed diagnosis of vestibular neuritis. 3/11/21 patient did not leave the bed except to use the restroom, however vomiting controlled with meclizine. 3/12/21 symptoms persist and patient has not yet improved.

Pain is substernal, radiated to the left arm, associated with lightheadedness.  Denies diaphoresis or nausea.  Per EMS there were short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia  3/18: - remains inpatient admission as of 3/18/21 @ 0900 63 y.o. male with a past medical history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He states he was lifting a couch yesterday and his heart started beating fast.  He did not really have any chest pain, but felt a little bit lightheaded.  He called an ambulance and they brought into the ER.  In the emergency room his EKG did show some frequent PVCs.  However, he did not really require any intervention.  He was given 3 nitro, but it really did not make any difference in the way he was feeling.  The patient denies multiple times that he actually had chest pain.  He states he just felt like his heart was beating funny.  The patient&#39;s most recent stress test was a nuclear stress test in May of 2019.  Overnight, the patient has felt very well.  He denies any significant chest pain.  He denies any further heart palpitations.  On the monitor he would occasionally going to bigeminy, which is not abnormal for him.  EKG this morning was unremarkable.   After speaking with the patient&#39;s wife, she told me that he has had a several month history of very limited exertion.  She states every time he exerts he becomes extremely dyspneic and has heart palpitations and sometimes almost passes out.  She states last night he was extremely diaphoretic and very nearly passed out.

Currently, 8 days after the injection, my left shoulder joint remains sore and any motion to left my left arm laterally from my side is painful; like my joint is inflamed.  There is no redness or other visible external signs or discoloration.  I can not say for certain it is linked to the Modern vaccine as I&#39;ve had left shoulder issues infrequently in the past.  But timing wise, my current discomfort started shortly after receiving the vaccine.

The most significant side effects subsided within 12 - 15 hours after onset (about 24 - 27 hours after the inection.   dull headache and light headed feeling went away about 36 hours after injection.  No medical treatment was sought.  I took two Advil on Friday morning (injection was 11:15 am Thursday), but did not take more because I read an article that suggested taking Advil and similar medications could negatively affect the anti body production.

The room was spinning. Has dissipated over time, but I have experienced vertigo when I lie down to sleep just about every night since 26 Mar. I also have dizziness sometimes when I look down. Mostly resolving in that the room doesn&#39;t spin as intensely as at first, but I can tell something is not right.  Feels like I have a low grade headache most of the time. I am hesitant to get the second shot.

                                                My left hand was in severe pain for maybe two hours. I took three Aleve to try and stop the pain. I could not close my hand into a fist, nor could I hold anything in my hand. No grip at all. My hand remained like this for most of her night. Today it is a little better, I can close my hand and make a fist, but I am unable to close tightly and grip anything. I feel as though the strength in my left hand is gone for now. No pain today but the muscles in my wrist and in my left hand are still somewhat tight  and present what feels like muscle tightness parallel to a pulling of the muscle. I rode my motorcycle to work yesterday, the morning ride was good, on the way home, my hand started with the pain thing. It was severe enough to prevent me from using the clutch lever properly. Presenting a lot of pain squeezing the lever to engage the clutch.

                                                A Week after my first dose ~ I had a rash all over my body 14 hours after my second dose.  I awoke to a very painful cramp about an inch below my left rib on my left side that lasted for almost 2 hours.  The more I moved, the worse it became.  I could not go to the bath room  and when I drank water, the cramp intensified.  Worse pain that I had ever experienced.  I sweated profusely.  Felt like I got kicked in the side.  I was not nauseous, a little dizzy for a moment.  My mouth was dry only because of my heavy breathing.     My second episode happened the following Saturday morning,  I don&#39;t think that it was as intense, but it felt like it was only because my left side was sour from Friday mornings episode.     My third and final episode happened again early Sunday morning.  This one was not as intense, but still woke me up and made me struggle.   I did not experience another episode on the 4 the night from my second dose.  At this time, my left side feels bruised internally and I have to change the speed of my walk.  It hurts to walk fast

However, several after weeks after vaccination patient developed soreness at the injection site with a raised bump and redness surrounding the area on 4/28. There was no associated weakness in the arm except due to pain which prevented him from lifting his arm. The patient experienced diarrhea for about a week prior. He did not see a doctor for this and attributed this to a viral illness. The soreness and swelling resolved after 4 days. The patient reported the reaction on 4/28. He was given a prescription for PT, but as it resolved by the time of his appointment, he did not see PT. The patient reports that the injection was high on his shoulder, about 2.5 fingerwidths below the joint. He denies experiencing joint pain.

                                                Hello,  Had the 2nd Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at the pharmacy on April 2nd at 6:45 PM.  The nurse asked me to stay around the store for 15 minutes for any immediate side effects, and to drink plenty of water when I got home.  Did some shopping, and probably left about 30-45 minutes after the shot with no side-effects, and when I arrived home about another 45 minutes later still had no side effects.  Upon waking the next morning my right arm where I received the shot was extremely painful, and I could not raise any higher than parallel to the floor without extreme pain for 2-3 days.  Then I also started with a slight fever, which of the times checked, reached about 101.  Also was getting muscle and joint soreness, and later that started getting extreme cramping in my leg calf muscles while sitting on the couch.  I then had to stand up for 5-10 minutes, or walk around a little and then after sitting the extreme cramping would begin again so I would have to stand up again.  That went on all day.  When laying down that night the cramping would subside enough to sleep a little on and off during the night.  The calf muscle cramping started to gradually subside, but took about 17 days to go completely away.  The day after the vaccine when my legs were cramping I was extremely worried about possible leg clots since I had never had extreme leg cramping like that my entire life, and I was drinking plenty of water like the nurse recommended.

                                                Serious lower left back which I believe was my left kidney. The serious pain problems started the day after receiving the shot and lasted for at least two weeks.    As the kidney pain started, my fingers started to feel numb and they have felt numb ever since.  Left hand is a little worse then my right hand.  Want to get second shot but?? I have walking pneumonia since 1973, since I was 15 years old, and will die if I get Covid 19.  I need help to know what happened to me, and maybe monitor me during second shot.  I am open research person. I am a 64 year old man that has had walking pneumonia since I was 15 years old in 1973.  I know that if I do get Covid-19 I will quickly die.  I need vaccination from Covid-19.    I received my first Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on Thursday March 18th, 2021 after 3 PM and immediately had problems.  I had problems in my left lower back which I believe was my left kidney. The serious pain problems started the day after receiving my first Covid 19 Moderna shot and the pain lasted for at least two weeks.  Immediately as the kidney pain started, my fingers started to feel numb and they have felt this way ever since.    This lead me to the situation of &#34;I am damned if I do and damned if I do not&#34;.  I want to get the second Covid-19 vaccine shot because I am truly scared to die if I do get Covid 19.  But if I do get the second shot, what will happen to me?  I am scared that it may have the kidney pain again, may worsen my numb fingers problem, and/or do other damage to my body.  It may already have caused other problems?      In summation, whether I get the second Covid-19 vaccination shot or not:  Get the second shot: 1. Everything could be OK?   2. I could have Kidney pain again, possibly doing damage or more damage to my body, even my numb fingers could get worse!  Not get the second shot: 1. Be lucky and not get Covid-19. 2. Get Covid-19 and die.  I want very much to get the second Covid-19 shot, but I am scared and I find nobody cares about what had and has happened to me regarding my kidney pain and my fingers becoming numb, and any future consequences to me if I get the second shot.  I do not know what to do.  My current and main concern to me, for now, that if I do get the second Covid-19 shot I will get that kidney pain and may do worse damage to my fingers feeling numb or possibly other damage to my body.  I am not sure what happened, as a non medical person I can only guess things like maybe I have blood clots that reduce the circulation in my hands.  I just recently got on government assistance only because of this Covid-19 problem and I had a very hard time trying to find a job, I had no choice.  I have not been on government assistance long enough to get financially stable to afford medical insurance, but I plan to do so as soon as I can.    I tried to tell my doctor, but she kept telling me to go to the emergency room.  So, I finally went to the Hospital on Friday April 16th.  They checked my bloodwork and told me I was OK and OK to get the second shot, but I had really no explanation as to what had happened to me, my kidney, or my still numb fingers, or most of all, what might happen if I get my second shot.  I am hoping to get help, for someone to care about me, my health, and my future health.  The numbness in my left hand has been a little stronger than my right hand.  I had the shot in the left arm and my left kidney had the pain, if any of these matter. The left kidney problem was very painful within 2 days.  I could not do anything due to the pain.  I could forget about dealing with my feet in any way, such as to tie or untie shoes, put on or remove socks, getting out of bed, and just about anything I did, any movement at all was very painful.    What has me very worried is the continuous numbness of my fingers.  I want to get back to work and my profession involves computers and keyboards, and my numbness in my fingers bothers me, even having problem feeling the raised bump on the f&#39; and j&#39; keys.  The most immediate problem is trying to untie shoestrings, which I cannot feel to do due to my fingers feeling numb.  This problem with my fingers affect my life in many ways continuously everyday.  I cannot feel zip lock bag openings.  I have had a left kidney problem once before over 2 years ago, which I believe was a result of doing Benicar for my blood pressure. I have only had that problem that once and I got off Benicar and have never had the problem since, not until a day after I had my first Moderna Covid 19 vaccine shot March 18th.    For both of these times, the left kidney pain I immediately stopped all of my medicines and after a few weeks the pain went away.  This time was muc worse than the first time. I have high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol and take medicines for these.  I resumed these medicines after the pains went away.    As to the fingers feeling numb, I have never had this problem in my life.  My left hand fingers are a little worse than my right hand fingers.  They feel as if they are very cold for frozen, or I have burnt my fingers.  I have never felt this feeling ever in my life.  At the beginning of, January 1st to be exact, when I was 15 years old and in the 10th grade, I came down with pneumonia and was very sick.  It was not until the middle of March when my mother took me to the emergency late at night when she got a doctor to see me on the side.  The doctor gave me prescriptions of antibiotics, cough syrup, and Guaifenesin (which was a prescription in 1973 and is the main ingredient in Mucinex).   For the next 2 weeks I came home from school and laid down on the sofa and filled up about a third to a quarter of a medium size mixing bowl with phlegm from my lungs.  After that doctors have told me I ruined my lungs and I will have walking pneumonia for the rest of my life.  I have lived with this problem and have had to pay special attention to my lungs my whole life.    When I saw on TV a report on the second e-cigarette and what if did to the lungs, I said that looks like what happened to my lungs when I was 15 years old.  I recently saw news that someone had a similar problem.  However, because of my walking pneumonia I need to get the second shot or vaccinated in whatever way, I want to live.  Please help!

He rand a low fever for 12 hours.  Afterwards, he complained that he had &#34;not felt right&#34; since the second shot.  He died of a heart attack on May 27, roughly one month after his second shot.

                                                I started feeling cold and shaking and very bad headache and discomfort all over. I was bedridden for a couple of days, then it got a little bit better and then it got worse again. Then it got hard to breath. So I lost over 30 pounds in the matter of a month and that is unlike me, I have always been overweight and a food addict and so I called the DR and they told me to get a covid test because the symptoms were similar. I got the test and it was negative. I went to the ER and they said I got pneumonia, which I do not know is related or not but it did happen after the shot and seemed pretty odd. I tend to be the person to just tough things out. At the ER they told me pneumonia in my right light and gave me antibiotics. I called my pulmonologist when home because it was getting worse and he prescribed more antibiotics. I went to see him and he took another x-ray of my lungs. I still had stuff in my lungs so he gave even more antibiotics. He took another x-ray and CT scan recently that I do not have the results of yet. I have vertigo which just started about two weeks ago as well, I read about exercises to do for that and it helped a bit but it came back and now cannot get rid of it. It still is kind of hard to breath as well. I have no appetite which is weird for me and I am cold which is also very strange. I usually could go in a cold place of like 35 degrees and be fine and now I am just always cold. Even when I know I&#39;m hot and know it&#39;s hot, I am cold and using a blanket. I shiver and shake so much from being so cold but my bed is soaking wet from sweating, it just doesn&#39;t make sense. I have a hard time going to sleep because I am cold and uncomfortable. Even today I am still very tired and now with the vertigo it is hard to do anything today, just talking a lot like right now I am out of breath.

Hospital tested for stroke but could not find evidence ( CT, EEG, Xray Bloodwork) History did not include that he had neurological side effects for the first Moderna vaccination. He was rushed by ambulance to a much larger hospital. I realized the error of not telling the history of the Moderna neurological adverse event from the hospital and called the hospital. The hospital had already sent him on to a larger hospital. I then contected his spouse regarding the adverse event from the first dose of Moderna. 4/15/21 at secondary Hospital, MRI, CT, EEG, Xray, Bloodwork still found no evidence of stroke. Precious time was lost. I called the nurses station to relay the information regarding the neurological adverse event from the first vaccination and told them that he had just taken his second dose. Soon they had their diagnosis and a path to treatment. He was diagnosed with Guillaine-Barre Syndrome with Variant caused by the Moderna Vaccination.

Today I have been dizzy for a couple of hours in the morning. My concern is that is not going away and I am worry, not knowing what to do. I contacted my PCP and left a message, I haven&#39;t talked to her yet.

                                                First unusual symptom the day after vaccine - felt as though we were experiencing an earthquake.  Unsteady balance since then.  I had aches common with flu shots, which are now (3/9) gone - these are not a problem.  Yesterday my apple watch said my heart beat was below 40 bpm for ten minutes a few times.  I tend to have a low heart rate so not a major surprise.  But last night when I got up, I lost balance and fell, hitting my head on a chest.  No major damage.  But feeling of dizziness is still a little present.

                                                I left the vaccination feeling nothing at all. I awoke the next morning with a moderate pain/discomfort in my left upper arm at the vaccination site. I went to work because I felt okay.  I have five years of recovery.  As a result every 8-12 moths I undergo an episode of about three days where my brain forgets how to sleep properly.  So the morning after my injection, I was on my second day of irregular sleep. Around 10 am, the side effects started kicking in.  I had a slight to moderate pain above my ear on the right side of my head.  I probably had a slight fever as I felt warm and sweaty for about four hours.  I felt slight to moderate chills during the height of my discomfort for about four hours.  I could hardly walk the five blocks to my girlfriend&#39;s home because I was very conscious of my breathing.  (I have been a heavy cigarette smoker for 4o years and an developing a heightened awareness of my breathing and pulse as I feel that I am overdue for a stroke or heart attack after 40 years of heavy smoking.)  Therefore his side effect was largely hypochondriacal.  I took off work yesterday even though the side effects had subsided. Today, I feel great. I feel so great that I laughed at the entry below - &#34;Patient Died&#34;.

                                                ADVERSE EVENT REPORT: MODERNA VACCINE 1 of 2 Dates: Feb. 17 to March 16, 2021  1. I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

This side effect has continued a second day causing me to notify my primary care provider and preparing this event report.  Other side effects experienced after the second vaccination were soreness at the injection sight, mild fatigue, and slight fever which were all anticipated. These side effects have passed.

                                                On 3/20/2021 I woke up with vertigo (never have had it before).  After symptoms persisted all day  iwent to Doctor on 3/21/2021. After examination of the ears was normal I was prescribed Meclizine 25 MG tablet (1 tablet 3xs/day by mouth); Ondansetron ODT 4 MG Tablet (1 tablet by mouth prn for nausea every 8 hours); and, Fluticasone Proprionate Nasal Spray USP (2 sprays in each nostril every day at bedtime).  Symptoms persisting today and I have made an appointment with my ENT for tomorrow 3/23/2021 at 8 a.m. for evaluation.  Saw on website that numerous similar reactions thought by the reporters on that website to be vaccine related so I thought that I should report my situation.

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

                                                1.) Strong soreness in lower back and gut area. Hard to bend over. I don&#39;t typically suffer from back pain and didn&#39;t exert or do anything that might have strained muscles. Pain seems muscular in back and deep in lower gut/groin area in front.  2.) More concerning is the tinnitus or ear ringing I am experiencing. Very loud and unrelenting. Feels like ears need to be popped such as when air pressure changes. However, can&#39;t swallow hard or chew hard enough to clear ears. It&#39;s a bit flummoxing as it is unrelenting. Sounds like cicadas in my head.

I put the thermometer on my nightstand thinking it prudent to have it handy. In bed under covers I kept feeling cold and started shivering/teeth chattering, within an hour or so my forehead thermometer read 102. My recollection of the time between midnight and 2 to 3am is vague as I was very disoriented, I recall taking my forehead temp several times during those hours - that took a lot of effort, and I saw several readings of 105 and I believe one over 106. I remember thinking I should be in the ER, then thinking how could I get there, then thinking I would call 911 but that I could probably not get my mind/body to be able to physically make a phone call. I believe that during this time span I had brief periods of consciousness when I was somewhat aware that I was having a high fever event, but that there wasn&#39;t much I could do about it (I live alone). By 4am I was more aware, forehead temp reading was 102.something - I got up and made my way to the kitchen, I was unsteady on my feet and remember telling myself to be careful and not to fall. Temp gradually dropped throughout Tuesday, mostly back to normal on Wed.

Fourth day also had chills, sneezing and runny nose.  Brain fog, fatigue and lack of coordination improved over the following days.  The second dose receive 4/13.  First day fatigure, chills, lack of coordination and muscle aches along with a lot of soreness at the site of the injection.  Second day also had dizziness, mild abdominal cramps and mild headache.  Could not eat until midday.  The third day dizziness, brain fog and lack of coordination continue.  Close to a point of seeking medical care but probably worth filing a report.

Explained that he had COPD and a post traumatic event from a hospital but received previous dose with no issue.  After receiving the vaccine, patient stated he was hot and dizzy. An another associate gave the patient water. Patient still had complaints of dizziness and I confirmed that the patient was not having an anaphylactic shock (patient was still able to breathe, talk, and no signs of swelling, hives, or itching). Proceeded to place patient to lay down with his feet elevated with feet with pillows and fanned him while store management and 911 was called. Continued to fan patient until ER services came to assist.

I would remain still and my vision would come back, first in the right eye and then the left eye.  It always happened the same way.  My left eye would begin to go black from the outside circumference to the middle, losing site, and then the right eye would start to do the same thing.  It hasnt happened again after that first month of reoccurrences, and it never happened before the shots.

                                                Mil headache, muscle joint pain and Vertigo like symptoms that have lasted 1 week so far. The dizziness is coupled with nausea depending on my activity. I was unable to do much at all because of the severity of this. I will not take another vaccine no matter what. Being this sick is ridiculous, I will take my chances.

Sometimes it is difficult to stand from a sitting position and once I do obtain a vertical position, baby steps are required until my legs are loosened up. This pain seams to come and go, one day the pain level will be a 2 and the next a 5 with no reason, I have been minimizing  activities to provide rest for it, but it does not seam to be doing any better.

                                                3 weeks after injection: Sudden onset of hearing loss in one ear, feeling of fullness/congestion in ear. Absolutely not a bacterial ear infection - no soreness/pain, redness, or discharge. Visited an ENT Dr. and inner ear issue confirmed. Hearing test showed significant loss or hearing (loudness) and loss of word discrimination.  Fri, 2-Apr: 1st COVID shot (Moderna). Slightly sore arm, no other symptoms/side-effects, all clear in 24 hrs. Fri, 23-Apr: Relatively rapid (over an hour or so) onset of hearing loss in left ear. Feeling of fullness in left ear, thought it might be congestion.  Sat, 24-Apr: No change/improvement in hearing of feeling of fullness in left ear. Sun, 25-Apr: I started to feel dizzy. I developed vertigo, though I did not get nauseous. Slept it off. Mon, 26-Apr: Awoke with no dizziness or vertigo. No change/improvement in hearing or feeling of fullness in left ear. Dizziness returned after dinner. Vertigo followed, more severe than the previous night. Unable to walk without help. Vomited and the nausea passed. Vertigo abated a bit, though still present. Slept it off. Tue, 27-Apr: Awoke with no dizziness or vertigo. No change/improvement in hearing of feeling of fullness in left ear Wed, 28-Apr: Saw ENT. First hearing test. Test confirmed quite a bit of hearing loss in left ear and some in the right ear. Thu, 29-Apr: 2nd COVID shot (Moderna). No side-effects until evening. Slight body ache, mild headache, maybe a mild fever. Some dizziness after eating. Fri, 30-Apr: Continued mild side-effects from COVID shot. Some dizziness after eating Sat, 1-May: Side-effects from COVID shot completely gone. Left ear noticeably worse. Sounds more attenuated, speech sounded more distorted. Sun, 2-May: No improvement in hearing Mon, 3-May: 2nd hearing test. Test confirmed significantly reduced hearing (volume) and speech recognition in left ear. Agreed to steroid injections to try to clear the suspected fluid retention/swelling. Tue: 4-May: 1st eardrum injection (10 mg dexamethasone) at 11:00 AM. No noticeable effect through bedtime. Wed, 5-May: Woke up with notably improved hearing in left ear (now only 10 or 20% attenuated). However, felt dizzy as soon as I woke up. Dizziness persisted until late afternoon. Thu, 6-May: No dizziness Fri, 7-May: 2nd eardrum injection (10 mg dexamethasone) at 11:30 AM. No noticeable effect through bedtime. Sat, 8-May: No improvement in left ear hearing, mildly dizzy when I woke up, dizziness persisted until late afternoon. Hearing not great in right ear over the course of the day (maybe 20% attenuated) Sun, 9-May: Minimal improvement in left ear hearing, if any. Right ear still partially impaired. A little light headed at times, no real dizziness. Mon, 10-May: Not dizzy when I woke up at 5:30 AM. Made a cup of coffee and ate an oat bran muffin at 6:15. Felt mildly dizzy by 6:30, persisted through the day and started to abate by evening. Tue, 11-May: No dizziness when I woke up. Hearing in left ear marginally improved. 3rd eardrum injection at 4:30 PM. Wed, 12-May: Woke up with improved hearing in left ear, still some attenuation, almost no distortion, still some feeling of fullness in the ear. No dizziness. Thu, 13-May: Woke up with hearing unchanged from Wed (i.e. no back-sliding). No dizziness in AM, though slightly lightheaded. Hearing degraded as the day progressed. Fri: 14-May: Woke up with hearing worse as compared to Thursday. Feeling of congestion/fullness in ears (more on the left than the right). Slightly lightheaded, no dizziness.

It gets better with attention to hydration and good sleep.   Pretty profound initially.  It has gotten better over time, as happened in the past.

                                                Symptoms are variable but some combination troubles me every day since March 6, excepting the twelve days I was on the Prednisone prescription.  In general, pain increases during sleeping hours, when I grow stiff and less flexible. I wake several times during the night (almost hourly) dry-mouthed. I don&#39;t know if pain wakes me or not. I rise with great difficulty and hobble to the bathroom.  Mornings are the worst part of the day, but I find if I keep moving, I loosen up and the general inflexibility goes away, and to some degree, so does the pain. It is never entirely gone. I also find that the pain seems to generally occur during movement and not at rest, although the pelvic pain and upper leg pain has and does occur while at rest.  The most regularly-occuring pain is hamstring and shoulder (shot locations). Rising from a laying or seated position has always been the most difficult.  Lately, pelvic pain has been rare, and knee pain intermittent.

However, in the same time frame I have begun to have a constant ringing in the ears.  The dizzy spells are getting worse and today lost me a job.  I mentioned it to one of the doctors when he was treating me for a sprained wrist that I got when a dizzy spell caused me to fall down.  He blamed the ringing on me being exposed to loud noises.  He said the dizzy spells were from drinking and smoking.  This was the first time I&#39;d ever seen this doctor and he gave me those diagnoses without any examination.

                                                June 14, 2021   This E-Mail concerns continuing ?side effects? from the second shot of the Moderna vaccine.   I received the second shot on May 11.   Today is June 14.  So, I am writing this report 5 weeks after the last shot, with many of the effects continuing.  I am 64 yr. old male.  I have a history of high blood pressure, which has been controlled successfully with medication for the past 8 years.  I had a hemorrhagic stroke in 2013, successfully recovered.  Otherwise no severe disease-type medical risks, I am health and physically fit.  I live with serious chronic pain from a multitude of factors.   I have severe tendinitis-type problems in my arms and legs; joint stiffness and pain, tight muscle problems.  The vaccine ?attacked? and severely worsened these symptoms.  The night of the vaccination, I started getting serious pain in a number of painful areas ? knees, ankles, elbows and forearms, like inflammation, all at once.  This pain advanced to injuries in prior injured areas, like knees forearms lower legs, and worsened when I would try basic loosening up exercises, to point that I could barely walk for a couple of weeks.  After exercising or loosening up, muscles and joints would tighten up severely, exacerbating pain and function.   I was barely able to walk or do much for a week or more.  I?ve needed extra bodywork and chiropractic sessions to deal with this.  The problem with tendinitis areas is less bad than right after the shot but still significantly worse than it had been before the vaccine.  When exercising, I am slower and able to do less time at cardio functions and have to lift 10-20 lbs. less weight when using weight machines.  I also get joint pain, ala knees when I use exercise bike; knees and shoulders get a certain type of pain (I feel it on the outside of the joint).  These are quantifiable factors.  The joint problems mirror a type of joint problem I had for a couple of years after my stroke, not what I experience every day.  The joint is weaker, and I feel a vague pain like the pain is coming from outside of the joint.   So, the vaccine seems to have ?attacked? and exacerbated problem areas of mine which already affect my ability to function adequately, and it is unclear whether or not these will fully resolve.  It is not a ?one or two-day? thing as suggested.    Additionally, I?ve generally felt drowsiness and ?headachy? during the day since.  These symptoms have lessened, but still there to some extent.  It is unclear whether or not I will fully recover or if anything else is wrong.  I am doubtful that I should take any additional ?booster shots? later if suggested or mandated.  Your attention to this matter is very much appreciated.

On May 30, 2021, I suddenly got right leg pain which made me couldn&#39;t walk for even 20 steps. The whole right leg from the heel to the butt feeling painful. Those pain I felt like muscle pain, tendon pain, ligament pain and nerve pain. It&#39;s already the 7th week. Even though now the pain is lighter than before, but it&#39;s still painful. I took some medicines to ease the pain, but I didn&#39;t go to doctor.

                                                Beginning 1.5 hours after the 2nd Moderna dose, my hands began shaking, and my arm was sore. These symptoms continue today and have not gotten better.  Beginning 2 days after the shot, my left foot from my toes to my ankle turned black and green.  Beginning 1 week after the shot, my toes turned purple; this has continued on and off since May 5, 2021.  Beginning 2 weeks after the shot, the lymph nodes in my neck, roof of my mouth, nose, and ears were swollen and tender. At random times, I would get hot and begin to sweat profusely 2-3 times per day, and my ears would get extremely red. At this time, my temperature would be between 100F and 101F, and my blood pressure was elevated. These symptoms lasted about 4 weeks.  Beginning 3 weeks after the shot, I developed a walnut-sized, squishy knot on the inside of the joint of my left elbow. I also began losing the hair in my armpits and have since completely lost all the hair in my armpits and on my legs.   Beginning 4 weeks after the shot, I developed a golf-ball-sized, squishy knot on the inside of my right knee, similar to the one that appeared on my elbow. I also developed a walnut-sized, squishy knot on my left knee just below the kneecap.  Beginning 5 weeks after the shot, I developed shin splints but had not completed any running or other activities that could explain the tenderness in my shins.  Beginning 6 weeks after the shot, I noticed a loss of muscle mass in my arms and legs.   Beginning 7 weeks after the shot, I have had severe chest pain three times. Each felt like I was having a heart attack; 2 times were in the middle of the night and 1 time was early in the morning.   Beginning 8 weeks after the shot, I began getting lightheaded at random which has caused me to fall multiple times. In addition, I have begun bruising very easily; the bruises take weeks to heal. My left eye is also extremely tender and waters more than normal.   Beginning 9 weeks after the shot, I notice that I have begun drooling even though I have never drooled in the past. My gums occasionally feel tender when I brush my teeth.

                                                History      Chief Complaint Patient presents with ? Elevated Blood Pressure ? Dizziness     multiple times a day   Patient who presents to the emergency department today for evaluation of hypertension, head pain, blurry vision, and neck pain. He states about 6 months ago he had open heart surgery. Since that time he states that he has been having intermittent episodes of blurry vision usually lasts a few minutes and resolve on their own. Today however, he notes that the blurry vision lasted for greater than 5 minutes and he started to become concerned. During that time he also began to experience some pain in his neck and a headache in the back of his head. He took his blood pressure at that time and noted that his systolic blood pressure was in the 190s. This alarmed him and so they called EMS. When EMS arrived they rechecked his blood pressure again and his systolic blood pressure was over 200. Upon arrival here to the ER he states that he is feeling much better and his blood pressure appears to be better as well. At this time he states he still having some right shoulder pain and a little bit of right-sided neck pain but he does state that he had his Covid vaccine yesterday in his right arm. Currently patient states he still has a little bit of a posterior headache but it is much improved. He denies any fevers, body aches, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or swelling of the lower extremities. He has no known drug allergies.       ? ED Course: I discussed physical exam finding with patient. Apparently most of his symptoms have already resolved at this time. His blood pressure is back down to 142/98. I still advise since he was having some weird blurry vision I would like to get a CBC, CMP, troponin, EKG, and a chest x-ray. Patient agreeable to this plan of care. We will also continue to monitor his blood pressure to ensure that it does not spike back up.     Patient&#39;s work-up was unremarkable. His blood pressures down to 123/60 and states he is feeling much better. This point time it sounds like what happened was a hypertensive urgency. I advised him he needs to contact his PCP and schedule close follow-up discuss if anything further needs to be done. At this time though he is safe to be discharged home with strict return precautions.

When I was sick with COVID-19 in September 2020 I had same issues with heightened smell and taste before I lost them for three months.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

                                                Approximately 16 minutes after receiving the vaccination, I began to get quite dizzy.  The staff was notified by my wife; and, a Pharmacist responded immediately to check on me.  As minutes passed, I became more dizzy and was experiencing a mild &#34;out of body&#34; type experience as though I was in some sort of a dream.  Knowing in advance that many people had experienced adverse reactions from these vaccines, my wife and I had brought along an &#34;eppie pen&#34; in the event I might experience something similar.  The problem was that my &#34;pens&#34; had expired in 2015.  My condition improved when I lifted my facemask to get more air.  While the Pharmacy was obtaining a new &#34;Eppie pen&#34; for me, the Pharmacist told me to take the mask off.  This stabilized me until  we left after 45 minutes.  I did not need to use the new Eppie pen.  Still dizzy, my wife helped me to my vehicle.  Enroute, being somewhat weak, I clasped against a parked car and to the pavement.  During the trip home, my muscles began to ache and my joints stiffen and hurt.   A heaviness began to present on my upper chest.

The redness diminished throughout the rest of the day and for the next day I felt a little lethargic, dizzy, and weak in the knees.  I returned to the facility and EMTs took my vitals.  My blood pressure was slightly elevated but, no other negative indications.  They released me.

Discharged per wheel chair to lobby in alert/stable condition, to wait on bus to take him home. At 18:00 his neighbor heard him fall, could not get patient to answer phone, found him unresponsive. Neighbor called 9-1-1, ambulance personnel could not revive patient.  Coroner&#39;s office ruled his death as Natural Causes due to Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Diabetes, ESRD.  There were no indication of anaphylactic reaction noted when I questioned the coroner&#39;s office. The Coroner&#39;s office/EMS were aware the patient had received the Moderna COVID 19 vaccination that day.

                                                Began feeling very weak with a constant headache that later led to blurry vision on March, 2, 2021.  On the morning of March 4, 2021,  I was still experiencing a right sided headache as well as double vision.  I was no longer able to drive at that point.  I took my blood pressure digitally at the local pharmacy twice where it was 200/104.  I went home to call my physician and also have my wife take my blood pressure manually.  My blood pressure at that time was 214/106.  I went to the hospital where they examined me and then discharged me with a General Headache without a know cause.  I contacted my PCP and he advised me to quadruple my Lisinopril until my BP came down to normal range and see him the morning.  My visit the next day showed an elevated blood pressure, double vision, and a continuing headache.  My meds were adjusted to Lisinopril 10 mg qd and an addition of Norvasc 5 mg qd.  Later that day my blood pressure was down, but still not in the normal range.   The following day, March 6, 2021, I was still having the same issues despite the changes in medication.  I took my blood pressure at 6 pm and it was 199/104.  I immediately went to another hospital where I was admitted as  a &#34;stroke alert&#34; patient in hypertensive emergency.  I am presently being followed as an inpatient in order to get these issues under control.

                                                A little over 12 hours after getting my first Moderna shot I experienced severe joint pain in my left knee that caused my entire left leg to become so painful I could not move it at all, as if I pulled an ACL. I decided to ride it out as each day went by the pain subsided more and more to where after 3 to 4 days later the pain was about 90% gone.  I still feel a little bit of soreness on the left side of my left knee cap though.  I am mostly back to where I was before the shot.  During the first few hours of the worst pain I did experience a cold sweat also.  All in  all I am feeling pretty good now however, a bit concerned about my second dose scheduled for March 23rd though, especially considering that I have neve had a negative reaction to a any type of vaccine before and I am not allergic. Great thanks to all!

I felt a rush come over my body followed by rapid heart beat. These symptoms lasted about 2 mins then subsided. I really didn`t want panic everyone  or go to the hospital all I wanted was fresh air so I left, admittedly not my smartest move but I knew my doctors office was right across the street.  After 24 Hrs. still Light Headed, no breathing issues, heart rate normal  sore arm no rash.

                                                Exactly 4 days after receiving the vaccine I experienced intense stiffness of muscles and joints from neck to ankles.  I struggled to get up from sitting and then could barely walk until I was moving for a short while; then it was easier to walk but with the pain of the sore muscle/joint feeling.  It felt like I had been beat up, especially in my upper torso front and back.  It stayed the same until approximately 3:00 a.m.  on the second day.  i noticed the pain, stiffness, and difficulty moving was getting better.  It gradually continued to get better for the next 24 hours until completely gone.  My calf muscles were the last to return to normal.

                                                Prior to the vaccine on 2/13/21, He was a healthy 65 year old active college professor.   32 hours after the vaccination on 2/14/21, He had acute pancreatitis, which led to  septic shock and respiratory failure, and he was placed on a ventilator at  Hospital.   On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

At the end of the 30 minutes the patient complained of severe dizziness.  He also had nausea but stated that this was present prior to the vaccine.  The patient was pale and sweaty.  He denied any chest pain or difficulties breathing.  Attempted to get vital signs.  O2 was 96 on room air.  HR was 52.  Unable to get a blood pressure as the patient would not keep his arm straight.  Rapid responders were called to assist and a wheelchair was brought over.  When we were going to move the patient to the wheelchair he complained of even more dizziness so we did not move him.  He declined any juice due to nausea.  He was given a few sips of water and a cold pack was placed on his neck.  Urgent triage responded and attempted to get vital signs as well.  Manual blood pressure was 80/62, HR 47, O2 97% on room air, respiratory rate 14.  Patient denied diabetes or blood sugar issues.  He had eaten breakfast and took all of his normal medications.

The flu like symptoms went away around 24 hrs after the injection. The following morning around 3:00 AM I woke up with severe lateral movement. I was not able to walk, experienced severe vertigo and nausea. These symptoms began to reduce 24 hrs later. At this point double vertical vision began and lasted for approximately one week. Currently I have mild vertigo 18 days after the injection. I am able to drive safely and the vertigo symptoms are reducing day by day.

Then as time progressed, I lost my libido, sex drive, this vaccine made my vertigo worse...I am dizzy...My heart rate went down 10 bpm and I feel like I have a virus in me. The longer I sleep the worse it feels...If I had to go back and do this again, the way I feel, I WOULD NOT. This vaccine messed up my RNA and the Cytosine&#39;s are making me feel ill and not 100%.

                                                I initially had pain in left shoulder, some chills and light headiness. Those dissipated by the second day. But 5 days later I developed a hematoma in my left bicep. It was like someone punched my arm as it was purple and red. Within a few weeks it turned to a brown and yellow and currently no coloring. However, my shoulder is tight and some pain and my bicep is experiencing tightness and pain. The Dr who administered the shot was not wearing gloves and injected the vaccine towards the rear of the shoulder and caused me to bleed. I usually coagulate well.  My shoulder has discomfort and when moved side to side has a crackling and clicking.  I had Torn labrum surgery approximately 4 years ago.

I suffered 3 compression fractured vertebrae when I blacked out getting ready to get off onto a ladder to get down. No advance warning, no dizziness, no vision impairment, nothing except a sore knee when I bent over to kneel on the platform in preparation to get on the ladder. It was like someone turned off a light switch and then turned it back on after I was on the ground. Don&#39;t remember even getting down or a fall, but I was down on the ground. When I went to get back on ladder to retrieve my equipment I could not lift my leg due to pain and felt like I had a pulled groin muscle. Laid down and could not get up.

The patient was in his normal state of health until he got the 2nd dose of the moderna covid vaccine two days ago; since then he has been somnolent, weak, not eating or drink much, and slid out of his bed and woke up on the floor once. He came to the ED because he was so weak that he couldn&#39;t walk. He furthermore endorses suprapubic and generalized right-sided abdominal tenderness that started after two episodes of nonbloody emesis and chills while waiting in the ED. He denies fevers, chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity swelling, palpitations, brbpr, melena, dysuria, rash, easy brusing/bleeeing, headache, vision changes, and sensory changes.

As the evening went on the tightness spread across left arm into chest and neck and over to right arm.  Felt somewhat better in morning but still sore in both upper extremities.  2 days later (3rd day after shot) he went to use the restroom in his home and could not get himself off the toilet - he describes himself as having lost all strength in his legs and when he went to stand he fell right over.  He could not get up and had to be helped to the bedroom.  He rested for several hours and used a walker to ambulate around the house for the next several days.  Now feels back to normal.

Date and time of vaccination: (list both if they received both shots): 1st dose 1/29/2021 ~1300-1400. 2nd dose 2/26/2021 ~1300-1400. Pt reported ~3-4 days post-vac of 1st dose, pt experience ache and pain in every joints &#34;joints felt like I was crippled&#34;, reports his whole body was in agony only with movement but not at rest. Pt reported that these symptoms did not subsided and the 2nd shot seems to make the symptoms worse per had lots of muscle pain and he could not move, had to have his wife help him in and out of the bed. Pt reported he took extra strength Tylenol on 2/27/2021 after his 2nd shot for a duration of 3-4 days which provided no relief. Pt reported that just approx. a little over a week prior to his scheduled orthopedic surgery (2/18/2021 - for an microscopic surgery for his torn MCL in his left knee), pt was seen by his orthopedic surgeon because his left knee had puffed up on the side, as a result his doctor drained his left knee and gave the pt a cortisone injeciton in his left knee to reduce inflammation. Pt reports that after rcvding cortisone injection he felt great and all his ADEs from the Moderna vaccine subsided. Pt reported that his orthopedic surgeon had adv that his ADEs of joint and muscle pain and achiness may be vaccine related. Pt reported doctor prescribed him Methylprednisolone 6 days dosing regimen approx. 1 month ago, and while taking pt reported he felt great and all symptoms subsided. Then approx 3-4 days post last Methylprednisolone dose was taken pt reports all his symptoms came back again. Pt reached out to his orthopedic surgeon again and got another prescription for Methylprednisolone and just completed his last day of dosing today and reported no pain again while on the treatment. Pt have another follow up appointment with orthopedic surgeon on 5/4/2021.  Recommend pt to monitor if any of those symptoms occur again, and if so discuss with doctor and contact MD for further evaluation.  5/5-Patient does not have any pain at this time, he went to see orthopedic surgeon yesterday on 5/4/21  to get another Methylprednisone script just in case of relapse since the steroids significantly helped with pain in left knee. Ortho surgeon did not refill Methylprednisone script. Patient is upset and is at primary provider&#39;s office today to get another script.

                                                Site of injection (left shoulder) was slightly sore after about 4 or 5 hours.  Shot was administered at 8:05AM.  Felt fine until about 6:45PM.  Noticed aches and painst beginning in neck, shoulders, and a slight headache which came and went.  at 8PM, was very tired and began to feel somewhat lightheaded.  Went to bed and felt chills.  Awakened six or seven times during the night to urinate.  Was a little dizzy each time I rose from the bed.  Also felt feverish and took my temperature.  It was elevated to 99.3F, which for me is definitely elevated, since it is usually no higher than 98.6 and is often around 97.9F.   Felt very tired the next morning and had continued mild aches and pains and occaisional shingles-like stabbing pains in rotator cuff of left arm , mastoid bone behind right and left ears, and occaisional  random stabbing pains in earl lobes.  The pains were mild to moderate on occaision.  Left arm was a little sore during movement, especially near the shoulder.  Felt very tired throughout the day and went to bed at 8PM the day after the shot.   That evening in to nightime when I would get up to go to the bathroom, I began to feel better and after midnight of the second day, I felt pretty much back to normal.  The lightheadedness, aches and pains, and tiredness all went away by the morning .   I would also report that I ate normally during these effects and did not suffer any nausea or feel like vomiting at any time.

The trip to the bathroom I basically crawled since I was unable to stand up. The dizziness lasted for about 5 week. Unable to look up due to dizziness coming back. I lost 7 days of work and was extremely cautious of falling over going to work. Loss of appetite, balance, and a feeling of nervousness lasted for many weeks. Visited by family doctor and said it was nothing and not related to corvid injection. Visited neurologist and said it was not related to corvid injection. N one seemed to know what the problem was except I know it was caused by the injection.

                                                The first two weeks after the vaccine I got severe muscle spasms that were pretty much all over my body but they were mostly in my back, I could not even stand up straight. I was 50/60 degrees, could not stand up straight. Also for like 3 days straight I just slept. The back spasms were the worst, they have gradually gotten better but not completely better. It progressively gets better, but is going very slow. I talked to my DR and my Rheumatologist several times  throughout this time and I saw my DR at least once every six weeks since this began and Rheumatologist once since this has happened. This started on 2/19/2021 and it is now 7/19/2021. My Internist put me on Prednisone and Valium and muscle relaxer. The Prednisone helped, I was given those medications at different times, about a month apart.

                                                Woke up with extreme pain in my lower back; lesser pain in various joints. I could barely walk.   I have had back pain before, this was different. At first I assumed it was coincidence, but later after my wife had me check the &#39;side-effects&#39; of moderna shots, decided it was more likely the shot (I had no problem except shoulder pain with the first shot).   This lasted for several days - fortunately I had the weekend, and then hobbling around at work all I had to do was say that I&#39;d had the second Covid shot and everybody gave me enough flex to do my job slowly and gingerly. It was Thursday or Friday before I was able to get around with a semblance of normalcy, and nearly as many days before I was back to normal.  I&#39;ve had back problems before, including debilitating like this - but this was different - just pain.  I went to the chiropracter twice - he immediately recognized that I was walking bent over sideways, and that it was muscle rather than actual vertebra, as I&#39;ve had in the past. The first visit made things feel better for a few minutes, but I was still walking bent sideways. The second visit was during the time I was getting better, and definiately helped more.  Note, I don&#39;t know if this is cause (shot 2) &amp; effect (joint &amp; muscle pain). I doubt it was just correlation, but I&#39;ll grant the possibility. More likely, my opinion is that the shot caused something, which made things worse than they would&#39;ve been. Just over a month, hence not required, but included in case the time between shots is significant - doubt it, but included anyway.

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

                                                Received shot at 6pm thursday. Friday I felt tired, and by late afternoon had temperature of of 100.4.  I felt fine when I woke on Saturday, and felt pleased that my immune system was apparently working properly  Seeing nothing in the Moderna fact sheet about avoiding alcohol,  at dinner I had 3 and a half cocktails. Had no problem walking home and walking the dog, but after getting in bed, I had a much stronger reaction to the alcohol than I ordinarily would - vertigo, and the next day, extreme tiredness.  Though I don&#39;t ordinarily drink that much, I&#39;m a large man, and it doesn&#39;t affect me as  much.  I&#39;m concerned that the alcohol may have affected the efficacy of the vaccine, and wonder if avoidance of alcohol should be mentioned in the fact shett.

                                                Patient received his injection at 12:20 pm.  He was observed for 15 minutes and released.  Almost an hour later he was still grocery shopping in the store  he stated he very rapidly became dizzy almost like vertigo, began to feel shaky and sought a chair to sit down.  He quickly became  very nauseous and found a nearby trashcan to vomit but states he could only dry heave 3 or 4 times.  He became quite pale and sweaty.  He was observed by his wife accompanying him who is an RN.  After appoximately 15 minutes the patient began to feel somewhat better.  He was given a bottle of water to drink and he could sip it successfully .  He was able to stand successfully and walked back to the pharmacy where I checked his blood pressure (136/86) and pulse (68).  He refused a 911 call and said he felt about 95/100.  Will check on patient again later this afternoon.  Patient will check with his doctor before getting the second vaccine.

Had to hold shopping cart and sit down. 3 mins into dizziness I became nauseated and had to find a garbage can to vomit into. I had 4 episodes of dry heaving and was diaphoretic and sat for 15 mins and slowly the dizziness subsided. Pharmacist asked me to return to pharmacy the gave me water and took my BP. 136/86 HR68. It is now 3 hours later and I feel much better. I just ate lunch. I&#39;m very healthy with no issues and this literally floored me.

                                                About six hours after receiving the Covid Moderna vaccine I quickly began constant tremors that was strong enough that I could not walk or stand. I did not have a thermometer but I?m certain I had a fever. This lasted throughout the night. The following morning I was bedridden, unable to eat and had flu like symptoms. This is continued for three days now. I am slowly Beginning to gain strength but I?m still bedridden.

                                                He complained of dizziness the evening of the shot.  He went to bed and when he woke up the next morning he was having double vision.  Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

                                                Extreme pain in the left shoulder and arm at the injection site. Unable to lift arm past height of shoulder or head without further pain. Pushing with the left hand on an object creates pain in the arm and shoulder. Resting on the elbow will also create the same pain. The pain is constant. At night I usually wake up between 1 and 3 am from the throbbing pain. According to the physician, the pain seems to mimic a rotator cuff injury, which I do not have, nor have I had. I have been taking Motrin 2 to 3x per day, and Extra Strength Tylenol during those 1 to 3 am morning wake-ups. Putting the left arm thru a shirt is a painful task. Outside of arm at injection to the touch creates pain.

Went to bed shortly thereafter. Woke two or three times in the night. Began feeling somewhat warm instead of chilled (except for extremities, which remained cold to the touch). Felt weak and temporarily dizzy each time of getting out of bed. Awoke at one point with a headache, so took one Excedrin migraine tablet. Took a second Excedrin migraine tablet later in the morning of March 18, 2021, since headache persisted. Other than that, took no other prescriptions or supplements until the evening of March 18, 2021. Throughout March 18, 2021, patient felt occasional periods of weakness and took bedrest for it. Probably slept an additional 3 to 4 hours during the day. By evening of March 18, 2021, patient was feeling more normal. On March 19, 2021, patient experienced no adverse effects.

                                                Lower legs felt tired and sore., muscle pain. Progressively got worse over the month of February making it nearly impossible to bend, raise and lower myself. Saw my personal doctor on March 1st. He does not think it is vaccine related. Rans some bloodwork tests. Put me on Prednisone for 3 weeks. That did alleviate the muscle soreness/stiffness  but that seems to be starting to return now that I am no longer taking it. Have a Dr. appointment with a Rhuematologist on Friday 3/26/2021.

                                                My left arm is in excruciating pain I cannot use nor could I sleep first night. Arm is almost dead in some ways. I cannot life past my mouth as cannot even extend very well.  Severe pain, aching also pain down shoulder into right hand. I have tried icing, heat, applied Cold spray. It is slightly painful 2 days later but still lots of pain. I cannot use arm to do chores. Even brushing teeth was hard. Arm was fine till 10 hours later then became worse and worse. Plus have little strength in arm. I cannot use arm to dry myself after shower.  Arm continues to be painful, aspirin does nothing to alleviate pain.  I regret getting vaccine and have doubts to complete series as I heard second shot worse.  I have not sought treatment yet but may go see my PCP this week.

                                                Extreme pain and weakness in the right leg [mid thigh to lower calf].  Unable to walk or climb steps.  Unable to stand unsupported.  Right leg buckles and gives out.  Unable to travel, or see my doctor.  The onset of my issues were very sudden and immediate, no lead-up.  In a sitting or lying down position, I am able to freely articulate and rotate my right leg without pain.  In the nine days since the onset, I have treated myself with Aleive and a heating pad for my neck.  The issues have lessened by less than 25%.        Background:  due to spinal cord injury in 1996, I have permanent damage; sensory issues on my right side [mid chest to foot], and motor issues on my left side.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (10 day hospitalization and administration of oxygen therapy) on 01-Nov-2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension and Diabetes mellitus.    On 02-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). In March 2021, the patient experienced BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to AGEUSIA, CONSTIPATION, DYSSTASIA, GAIT DISTURBANCE and POLLAKIURIA, and then from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to ASTHENIA. On 06-Mar-2021, GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) had resolved. On 24-Mar-2021, ASTHENIA (weakness), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) and AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) had resolved. At the time of the report, POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination), BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter. Treatment History includes ER visit, hospitalization, IV fluids, IV medications, &#34;injections for blood sugar&#34;, EKG, scope to check for blood clots, physical therapy.  Based on the current available information, a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.  Causality for hypertension and blood glucose elevated is confounded the concurrent history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.

                                                Outcome: Patient Death CHIEF COMPLAINT in ER: chest pain, SOB  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 66 yo with PMH of chronic afib on chronic anticoagulation who presented to the ER with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and increased fatigue over the past several weeks that has progressively become worse. Patient denies orthopnea or PND but does have some palpitations and occasional chest pain associated with increased fatigue with exertion. On evaluation emergency room patient was noted to be tachycardic consistent with chronic atrial fib, also acute renal insufficiency likely secondary to dehydration. Patient is admitted to the medical service for further treatment and evaluation. DEATH SUMMARY Date of Admission: 04/07/2021 Time of Death: 04/10/2021 at 0737 Final Diagnoses: 1. Sudden Cardiac Death 2. Acute Renal Impairment Secondary to Hypovolemia, A TN 3. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation w/ RVR, Resolved 4. Atypical Chest Pain, Resolved 5. Hypokalemia, Resolved 6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea 7. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Hospital Course: Patient is a pleasant 66yo admitted for acute renal impairment secondary to significant o hypovolemia resulting in ATN as well as atrial fibrillation w/ RVR after presenting to ER with complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, malaise, and anorexia that began after receiving his second COVID vaccine on 4/01/2021. Please see H&amp;P for full details. Patient reported that on the day after his COVID #2 vaccine, he lost his appetite and was not able to eat or drink. He continued to take his home medications as prescribed including losartan, chlorthalidone, and meloxicam. After experiencing progressive worsening of symptoms for 5 days, patient presented to ER for further evaluation. Upon arrival to ER, patient was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. EKG showed atrial fibrillation w/ RVR. Routine labs were obtained and were remarkable for elevated creatinine and mild hypokalemia w/ normal BNP and negative cardiac enzymes. CXR showed enlarged cardiac silhouette, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or other acute abnormalities. Patient was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and medical management. He was staited on aggressive IV hydration for his hypotension and hypovolemia w/ PRN IV metoprolol as needed for HR&gt; l lObpm. He was continued on anticoagulation. Serial cardiac enzymes were obtained and were negative. TIE report from Dr&#39;s office that was performed recently was obtained and showed EF of 55-60% with Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient&#39;s wife brought his CPAP from home and patient wore his CPAP while sleeping during his hospital stay. During the course of hospitalization, patient&#39;s blood pressure &amp; HR improved, though he remained in atrial fibrillation. His creatinine continued to trend up consistent with ATN, but patient continued to produce adequate urine and he had no signficant electrolyte derangements. IVF were adjusted based on urine output and volume status. Patient had no recurrence in his presenting complaint of chest pain and he overall reported feeling better throughout his course of hospitalization despite reporting that he continued to have little appetite. Patient was monitored closely on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. On the morning of 4/10/2021, lab tech and nurse walked into the patient&#39;s room to obtain specimen for AM labs. Patient reportedly tried to get out of the bed independently, grabbed at his chest &amp; pulled off his telemetry, and fell to his knees. Staff called Code 99 and patient was placed back in the bed. He was noted to be in asystole. ACLS was performed and despite maximal efforts, patient subsequently expired at 0737. I personally called the patient&#39;s cardiologist &amp; personal friend, to discuss the events leading up to the patient&#39;s death. Upon review of the patient&#39;s course of hospitalization, it was felt that patient most likely experienced sudden cardiac death. Of note, Dr reports that the patient frequently contacts him via text message with concerns or complaints. He states that the patient did not message him during the hospitalization to report any chest pain or other concerns. Disposition: Patient Expired

He presented to the hospital with c/o 2 mo (since around 4/14) of progressive fatigue and weakness which progressed to dizziness and now shortness of breath the past month and was found to have profound pancytopenia. He had no history of alcohol use, b 12 or folate deficiancy, no recent illness, no medications, HIV and hepatitis testing were negative. He does not smoke. He had no prior history of problems with his white blood cell count, red blood cell count or platelet count. He admitted that shortly after his second vaccine he began to feel fatgiued with symptoms progressing afterwards. Upon admission his hemoglobin was 6.7 and he was given 2 units of blood. His D-dimer was elevated at 1224 and a CTA of the chest was negative for PE.  His PT/INR PTT were within normal limits EKG showed no acute ischemia and normal sinus rhythm.  Fibrinogen was 246.  His iron was 238 saturation of 77 TIBC of 309 and ferritin of 941.    His hemoglobin A1c was 6.0.  He was seen during his hospital stay by Hematology/oncology . vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal.    He has no prior history of malignancy.  Patient&#39;s ultrasound of the abdomen showed no splenomegaly.  Again vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were normal.  A peripheral blood smear was done which was concerning per oncology for an underlying bone marrow condition. Ultimately his bone marrow biopsy showed Acute myeloid leukemia with blasts and monocyte features.

                                                Pt was healthy prior.  Approx 4-6 weeks after the 2nd vaccine injection the pt was noted to have joint stiffness in the R shoulder which then progressed to knuckles, wrists, and legs with weakness at his artificial knees.  Stiffness was initially worse in the am and was without relief with NSAIDS.   Pt had trouble with ambulation and getting up and down from chairs/sitting.  He became significantly debilitated and f/u with MD ensued.  Steroid dose pack helped but after several days post completion the s/s returned.  C-RP &amp; ESR were elevated but all other RA and autoimmune markers were neg on his labs.  Repeat f/u with MD a Ketorolac Injection was given that didn&#39;t touch the s/s.  As the s/s continued the pt was then put on Celebrex 200mg bid and instructed to f/u with Rheumatology.  The pt gets relief with the Celebrex bid but if the dose is decreased to 200mg x 1 q day &gt; the pt has immediate return of s/s.  Repeat C-RP and ESR were again elevated on the second set of labs also.  We are in the process of follow up with Rheumatology who after first visit said he didn&#39;t know what was wrong with him.  We are pending additional labs and xrays this week. The pt has always been very active and healthy with no medical problems other then slight hypertension.  His body has gone into a systemic inflammatory response acutely for no reason.

It was very strong numbness such as when the hand is asleep and he could not use the hand.  He had 3 fingers that stayed awake.  This stayed this way for a day or two then his face went numb on the right side and  his right arm developed numbness as well, though there was no drooping or disruption of his speech.  He was concerned enough he went to the emergency department and they diagnosed him with Paresthesia.  The numbness left his face and arm after a few days but has remained in his hand and foot.

On the 10th day after the vaccine, I was playing golf around noon, and I started having heart palpitations and felt dizzy again and I stopped playing golf. I went to see my cardiologist. Diagnosed me that I basically had an occasional additional heart beat. It was occurring less than 3 percent of the time. They ruled out Atrial fibrillation.  I still have some episodes were I feel heart palpitations, they are not as frequent, they are totally random. It occurs maybe once a week now.  It doesn&#39;t stop me from exercising.

Most of the time it was mild enough not to require standing still. Follwing dose 2, the dizziness returned and has been persistent for the past five weeks. It is never severe but is definitely persistent, unrelated to activity, amount of sleep, time of day, occasional alcohol use, or diet.

This lasted about one minute and I did not pass out.  But about 25 minutes later, while driving home (alone), I experienced the same thing but for about 5 or 6 minutes.  Fortunately I didn&#39;t pass out.  About an hour after the shot I felt sort of back to normal.

I got up to help, cleaning up blood and checking injury.  After a while I got dizzy and fainted, got up too soon and fainted again.  I fainted a third time, had convulsions and lost bladder control.    Visited my PCP a week later.  Now have a neurologist appt scheduled, a month out.  Currently, I have no apparent issues.

I got to the bath threw up &amp; kept dry heaving. Sitting on the floor, I phoned Hospital,  and spoke with an ER nurse.  I reported my vaccine, my symptoms and told her I could not drive the 1 mile to the ER.  She indicated these may be some of the serious side effects of the Moderna Vaccine.  At 6am I crawled back to my bed &amp; woke at 9:30 am.  I called store &amp; spoke to the pharmacist who vaccinated me.  He concurs w/the ER nurse.  I am still very weak, still slightly dizzy, and very concerned.  I am a healthy 67 year old, lives by himself &amp; this episode frightened me.

When I awakened (about a minute later) I was unable to stand so I crawled to from the shower to bedside, but passed out again when I tried to pull myself up from the floor into bed.  My wife called 911 and the local fire department responded.  The EMT took my blood pressure while I was lying on the floor with my feet elevated and it was 78/34.  The EMT called an aid car and I was transported to a local ER.  At the ER, I received 2 liters of fluids over the next 4 hours.  I had an EKG, chest X-ray, blood work, and urine analysis which all were clear.  After 4 hrs, I was released and returned home.

Almost felt like falling.   I didn&#39;t want to move in bed since it would only exacerbate the body aches and make it worse.

I was driving home when this started.  I stopped to purchase Tylenol about 3 pm which it turns out had no effect.  I was driving west into a setting sun, as the headache got worse, my eyes became more and more sensitive to the sun, I stopped a second time to purchase a second pair of sunglasses that I could wear over the first pair, that didn?t help, I ended up stopping at a rest area until the sun set.  I got to my house at about 6 PM, by then I could no longer wear my prescription glasses, besides the headache I was now very dizzy.  At about 9 PM the pain started, between my shoulder blades first, never at the injection site.  From that time on, including today, the pain has constantly moved around my body, the worst pain is associated with areas that arthritis affects me, hips, knees, hands, ankles.  I have had a mild fever, ranging from 100.9 Saturday night to 100.3 now at11 AM 3-15-2021.  Yesterday, 3-14, my head was swearing, my feet were ice cold.  I had an electric blanket from my waist down and an ice pack on head.  If I have ever felt worse in my life I don?t remember when that would have been.  The pain has moderated today, I expect the worst is now over.    If as the health specialists are suggesting a booster will be required this fall I will undoubtedly have incredibly significant reservations with this vaccine.

                                                Very mild dizziness until morning of March12. I woke up at 02:00 AM in sweat and when I tried to walk the vertigo was so bad I couldn&#39;t walk. was disoriented and very nauseous. Was not improving and was taken by ambulance to ER.  Given medication IV and orally, slowly improved enough to go home by 11:00 AM. Still dizzy on March 16th and occasional bouts of vertigo. I seem to be slowly omproving.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                I felt extremely dizzy at 5 PM and checked my blood glucose.  It was extremely high, 283.  I checked again in minutes to be sure the meter was functioning properly and it was 280.  The meter was accurate enough.  With my meds over the past 2 years it has NEVER been this high!  I did not eat or drink anything that could have caused this spike.  I had a healthy lunch at noon.  I began drinking a LOT of water and went for a 20 minute aerobic walk.  At 6 PM glucose was down to 195.  At 7:30 PM glucose was down to 135.  Dizziness began to subside this whole time period.  I will continue to monitor glucose closely.

                                                I was very tired the night of 2nd vaccine, aside from that absolutely no side effects, hardly any arm pain, so all well.  I actually felt great for about 9 days.  Then on 3/22/21  I was suddenly awaken by an intense, and peculiar, bout of vertigo.  I am familiar with vertigo from ear infections in the past (last one about 15 years ago and the one prior about 22 years ago).  For me vertigo is a generally mild sensation that stays with me until it clears up.  This was, and is, much different, it ebbs and increases during the day, if I concentrate on a physical task it sort of diminishes, then comes back, at times it goes away completely for an hour or two then comes back strong.  At same time that this started my thoughts and mental acuity started to suffer kind of a &#34;brain fog&#34; is the best explanation I can give.  I also have a slight headache at the back of my head wrapping around to the temples, I don&#39;t know if I can link the headache to the brain fog since my neck often gives me trouble.  I have ruled out ear infection by purposefully spinning myself around to see if I would lose balance, did not affect my balance.  I can also walk a relatively straight line of about 20&#39; with my eyes closed without stumbling.  It feels like a kind of vertigo, but much different than any I have experienced in past and much longer lasting.

Especially my left knee backside and my right ankle. Both had been injured in the past. the pain was so bad that I was limping while walking. that lasted for three days then the intensity of the pain abated still noticeable in all the joint till about 1.5 weeks after the injection. Still now almost 4 weeks after injection I still feel the injection site in my left arm. A noticeable light pain and itching.

                                                I should point out that I donated a pint of blood 2 hours before getting my Moderna shot. I thought it would 27 hours before the shot but after donating the pharmacy called and said they had vaccine available if we wanted to move  up getting our shots right then 24 hours before our appointment.  8 hours later,  at 3:00am I got up to go to the bathroom. I immediately started feeling nauseous and light headed. I ended up collapsing and falling flat on my back. I immediately started shivering and shaking along with the nausea. For the next 12 hours I was extremely weak and my joints severely ached. It was very hard to move.   The total experience lasted roughly 18 hours before I started feeling significantly better.  Before donating blood I asked the if getting the Moderna Covid shot 27 hours (I thought 27 hours at that time) after donating would be a problem .  They said no. We asked the pharmacist before getting the shot if donating blood 2 hours earlier would be a problem. She thought naught and said she had no guidance against it.  I?m a very very healthy 67 year old. I rarely get sick and I have no prescriptions.  Complicating my blood donation was that my pulse was 44 beats per minute but my good health allowed them to proceed.  I?m not complaining about anyone or anything. I just thought you should be advised of my experience.

                                                He started developing right shoulder pain a week after the 2nd dose of the Moderna shot in his right arm. The pain persisted for another month and spread to both shoulders, both hips, and the muscles of his arms and legs. Tylenol and flexeril did not help much. He went to the ER on 3/15/21 where he received an IV fluid bolus and had his levothyroxine dose lowered a little. Since discharge from there, he then followed up in clinic on 3/23/21 where he said his pain and weakness were bad enough that he was having difficulty lifting his arms, grabbing objects especially at/above shoulder level, and holding objects in general to perform his daily activities of living. He was placed on a 2-week tapered course of prednisone on 3/23/21 and again required another 2-week course on 4/8/21 because when the prednisone wore off he was back to having pain and weakness.

                                                He got the vaccine, when she gave him the shot if felt like liquid fire going in, it was then fine.  Two hours later the arm started swelling up and got so swollen he could hardly move the shoulder.  Then it started moving into the shoulder quadrant, as far as your fingers can spread, all the way back onto the back itself.  It then traveled up to the neck, to the spine to the ear in that quadrant and stops at the knot behind the ear.  The pain is so bad that you press on the knot behind the ear the headache will go away.  The headache is so intense  it feels like it&#39;s going to blow off and takes migraine headache medicine which does not help it.  It now has caused vision issues, he cannot read/blurry vision with large print things close up.  He can see fine 5&#39; or further with no problems, but nothing up close and he can&#39;t drive due to this or use the computer as he can&#39;t see the keyboard to type.  The pain has continued even up until today, 4/14/21.   The shot area is fine now.   Originally when the symptoms started he could not turn his head as it hurt so bad, and has taken all this amount of time to actually turn his head some, but cannot turn it to the left much.  He can gently and slowly turn his head but it is painful.  He has gone to his doctor and went to the COVID clinic with the first vaccine who want to see him to a neurologist.

                                                Two days after my 2nd moderna shot I started to have pain in my upper left arm , at and above the injection site. a couple of days later a large raised welt developed on my bicep. it was as large as my hand. It last a few days but did fade away. The pain persisted in my upper left arm. some time later I started to feel soreness in my shoulder and the pain lessened. The soreness persisted and then it became more like a burning in my upper bicep. I visited my primary and she prescribed alleve. In a follow up visit she examined me, on 22nd , and recommended PT. She thought it was an impignment in my shoulder. I started physical therapy on June 24th. At that session the Therapist thought it to be a nerve issue causing loss of range of motion. I would get a severe burning sensation in my upper bicep , sometimes spreading to the entire bicep. Started some light exercise making sure to keep my arm in the painfree range of motion.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history was provided by the reporter.  Concurrent medical conditions included High cholesterol and Nerve pain. Concomitant products included ATORVASTATIN for High cholesterol, GABAPENTIN for Nerve pain, APIXABAN (ELIQUIS), ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (BABY ASPIRIN) and TAMSULOSIN HYDROCHLORIDE (FLOMAX [TAMSULOSIN HYDROCHLORIDE]) for an unknown indication.   In January 2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. In February 2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced THROMBOSIS (Went to ICU with 4 blood clots  in the left leg from the hip-down) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Pulmonary embolism) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), GAIT INABILITY (Unable to walk), POLLAKIURIA (Used to go to the bathroom (pee) 3-4 times at night) and MALAISE (Not too well). The patient was treated with Surgery (To clear blood clots) for Thrombosis. At the time of the report, THROMBOSIS (Went to ICU with 4 blood clots  in the left leg from the hip-down), PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Pulmonary embolism), GAIT INABILITY (Unable to walk), POLLAKIURIA (Used to go to the bathroom (pee) 3-4 times at night) and MALAISE (Not too well) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, X-ray: inconclusive (Inconclusive) His lungs were clear.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient received the  2nd dose on 23rd or 24th of February 2021.   Patient reported being in ICU for 9 days and in acute care for 2 days. Prior to the surgery to clear blood clots, the Eliquis was stopped, had staples, put tubes through for the surgery and was put back on Eliquis afterwards.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                As a physician for over 40 years I tend not to pay attention to my symptoms if I develop the flu or a virus. I just put up with it  I received a COVID-19 Moderna vaccination on January 7. Approximately 12 hours after I started to develop adverse reactions. These of Inc. severe myalgias, fever to 102, chills, headache, severe fatigue (to the point where it is difficult to get out of bed)  Not much reaction at the injection site. Hydrogen saturation  in the 90s and pulse in the 70s.  I did contract Covid in March 2020. I was alone for two weeks. However no respiratory problems or hospitalization.  I?m currently speculating that having had covered in March has resulted in a significant immune reaction from this vaccine.  I would appreciate your input on this.  Can I expect this again when I receive my second vaccine in one month?  Thank you

After 15 minutes he got up and looked to buy something on one of the aisle when he fell down, he was on his knees. The pharmacist got out there set him on a chair, looked for any injuries and asked him if his breathing was ok. He said everything was fine, and that he just tripped over his flip-flops. The other pharmacist called 911 while I stayed with the patient. He was fully aware of what was happening and he didn&#39;t present any signs of an allergic reaction. EMT showed up after 5 minutes and talked to him for 2 minutes, and told him he was ok to leave.

                                                The patient noted weakness starting in the legs on January the 19th, 10 days  after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.  The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

My wife had to help me get out of the recliner and get dressed for our trip. Also I was very confused. I was a bit nauseous and did not want to eat.  My blood sugar was 226.  For the next 6 hours as we traveled, I had to pee every 30-45 minutes. I needed help getting in and out of the rest stops and the vehicle.  As we traveled I mostly slept. I did drink a little diet soda, but did not eat.  After the 6 hours of travel I felt a stronger and was able to get out of the car and into the houses by myself.  For the next 24 hours I felt week, ate very little and sugers ran high.

                                                Nearly completely incapacitated.  Head spinning, very weak limbs, barely able to get out of bed and stand after extreme effort, no arm strength, could only move to the bathroom via baby steps with while holding on to whatever was available to steady myself.  I ended up on the floor and was barely able to get up and back into bed after considerable effort.  My arms and legs were like rubber.  I had fever and severe night sweats.  I was virtually unable to function.  This lasted from the night of 02/03 and continued through 02/04.  Finally 02/05 I was able to get out of bed and shakily stand. But I couldn&#39;t stay up long, as I had the aches and pains and a headache still.  Finally 02/06 I was able to get out of bed and stay out.  I hope my description describes the magnitude of my symptoms.  I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to survive.

Feb 3 about 13.5 hrs after second dose Moderna (3 AM), I showed no symptoms from getting shot at 1:30 pm Feb 2 until going to bed, but at 3 AM woke due to significant headache and arm soreness.  Laid there about an hour until I got our of bed at 4 AM, got Tylenol from hall closet and went in bathroom to take Tylenol.  I was fine until I tried to open Tylenol, and suddenly started sweating, dizzy, feeling faint.  Managed to get to floor with my wife&#39;s assistance, lay for awhile but couldn&#39;t get up to walk so crawled back to bed.  Had severe chills for over an hour until fell asleep.  Spend next 36 hours in bed due to headache and dizziness, very fatigued napping off and on, but chills never returned.  By evening of Feb 4 I felt stable enough to walk around the house and eat dinner meal at dining table.  Saturday, Feb 5 stayed home fatigued napping off and on.  By Sunday morning Feb 6 I felt good enough to play a round of golf without incident and felt 100% recovered by Sunday afternoon

Other symptoms were sore shoulder and mild headache that appeared on the second day following the shot.  The soreness and headache were expected and if those were the only symptoms I would not have reported them.  The dizziness was unexpected and had not completely gone away at the time of my second shot on 02/09/2021.  After the second shot they dizziness has gotten slightly worse.  The soreness in the arm is WAY worse with the second shot and there is achiness in my back, shoulders and neck as well as a headache that comes and goes.  Again, The only symptom that I did not expect was the dizziness.

                                                Got the vaccine, there was no pain, the shot was fine, no reaction.  Waited for 30 minutes due to his extensive allergies.  Went home and about 2 hours later he noticed when he was moving around it started to get painful just opening a door, etc.  It continually got worse, and maybe 3 hours later in the evening the pain got really bad, and it seemed to be more in his shoulder area.  Gave the shot kind of high, and the pain was real bad in the shoulder and could not raise the arm or use it much at all.  It was also a throbbing pain where he could feel his pulse with the pain in the shoulder.  It was almost like they hit a nerve.  He is still trying to get over it on day #5.  Each day it is starting to get better.  By Sunday the pain was letting up so that he could use his arm.  He is doing stretching exercises walking up the wall and it&#39;s complicated.  He has a history of shoulder surgery and had a total replacement in the right shoulder, and wonders if his pain is related to the bad shoulder and the cartilage being bad in that shoulder.  He is supposed to have surgery on it.  But the arm is better, can lift it 75%.

Everytime I moved my eyes, I could hear a whooshing sound in my ears.  I had to wear sunglasses and stay in the dark, as the light hurt my eyes.  It lasted for 24 hours, and another 12 hours of  and extreme stomach ache.

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

                                                More than normal pain was experiences as the vaccine was being administered. About four hours after injection, extreme pain in left shoulder, rotator cuff, unable to move arm .  Had to take ibuprofen approximately every six hours for the next 24 hours.  Two days since the injection, the pain is about 20 percent less.  NOTE 1: The probable reason for the unusual pain was that the injection was given much too high on the arm, near the top of the shoulder. I went back to the pharmacy on March 6, 2021, spoke with senior pharmacist, and showed the injection location with the band-aid still on. He noted it was a &#34;bit high&#34; and who had administered the vaccine. He said he would look into the injection technique of the person who had administered the dose.  NOTE 2 - THIS IS THE REASON I SUBMIT THIS REPORT: While the situation is handled at the pharmacy in question, I believe that with the rush to get the vaccine into arms, the CDC may need to pay more attention to the experience level of those administering it, making sure they have the proper training and actually have learned the proper injection technique. The CDC&#39;s YouTube video I have seen on the injection technique is a bit long.  The segment beginning at the 2:40 minute point should be separated and labeled &#34;injection technique for adults&#34; and have it made clearer that the injection is at the CENTER of the deltoid, with the very top of the inverted triangle NOT being acceptable.  My understanding is that the pain level from injecting at the rotator cuff is unnecessary and can lead to SIRVA - &#34;Shoulder Injury from Vaccine.&#34; Please take the necessary steps to ensure the vaccine is being properly administered at the correct place in the arm. Otherwise, too many people will be undergoing unnecessary,  extreme pain as I have .

                                                Within 48 hours of second vaccine, I developed a red spot on my right foot that was tender next to my small toe. This area became very soar and I am unable to walk on that part of my foot without  extreme pain and swelling. I have not seen a physician yet, but doctor ordered an x-ray which he said showed no fracture. I am waiting to see a podiatrist . My foot has shown no signs of improvement so far.

He chose to take a nap, which turned into staying in bed until today.  By the next morning the back sides of his neck, rear corners have been achy.  He has been exercising them, rubbing them and trying to work them out but they still continue to ache.  It is getting less.  The arm ache has been steady as well and has been massaging it, he can list his arm but has some difficulty with it.  No previous neck problems.  Did not take anything for the achiness.

Told my wife that something was seriously wrong.  Tried to slowly move to side of bed but never made it before falling back into bed.   Waited to see if would improve and when it didn&#39;t my son and wife put me into car and I was taken to an Emergency Center.   I was hooked up for monitoring (pulse OX, cardiac monitoring, and an EKG was taken,   Blood Work was done, and the Doctor said he was worried about a stroke/and or tumor because I looked so bad coming into their facility with help from their Nurses and sent me to get a head CT.   When trying to get up from CT I  fell backwards onto CT table.   Whole room was not just spinning but was moving from floor to ceiling and then back to floor to ceiling.   When I got back to room Doctor performed tests on moving my head and following his finger with eyes.  He had to stop because I was spinning so much.  He told me that I had Nystagmus.

I had 1 to 2 episodes while driving, but the reality discontinuity were only 10th-of-Secs, so no impairment.

They are very similar to the symptoms he had after his first vaccine. He reports body aches and upset stomach as his main symptoms. Also reports mild dizziness but that is improving. He states he at times is feeling anxious which makes his heart race and feels mildly short of breath. Denies new SOB with activity and is not feeling SOB right now. Does have medication to take for anxiety and this does help. He also states he is having bouts of confusion with what day it is, where he is, etc. RN notes pt does not sound confused on the phone and was able to verbalize name/DOB and answer questions appropriately. Advised to call 911 but patient declines. He states symptoms are worse at night and he would prefer to be seen in the office.

                                                Monday morning at 08:00am I experienced a short dizzy spell lasting 3 to 5 seconds while walking in my home. At about 09:30am the same morning I had another dizzy experience for the same duration. The remainder of the day I experienced a light headed feeling all day. The next day  (today) started out normal but by 10:00am I experienced dizziness again for about 8 to 10 seconds and as I write this report I have a light headed feeling again. Note: one week ago I had a sore gland under in my jaw on the left side just below my left ear which lasted for 3 days and went away without treatment. I have not seen a Doctor in reference to this condition yet.

                                                On April 6, one week after second dose of vaccine I experienced severe headache which encompassed forehead, sinuses, base of skull and which started in the morning and became worse through the day and lasted into the night.  I took ibuprofen several times during the day and next day was feeling better.  Since then I have had daily wooziness/fogginess to varying degree, accompanied by headache which comes on late in the day.  I am using ibuprofen to alleviate the symptoms, but which does not reduce the fogginess/wooziness.

Felt woozy and a little dizzy, and that continues - though has lessened. (I cancelled a meeting because of it.)    Left shoulder feels tense. Sleep and aspirin helps.  I have more energy today.  Google says these side effects are common, but usually start right away or during first few days.  I could not find anything about these side effects starting 10 days after the injection.

Intense throbbing pain began around 6:00pm same day (Thursday, Jan 21) and lasted four days (into Monday).  Ibuprofen and Tylenol taken in maximum allowable doses offered mild relief but was insufficient.   Arm became unusable during that period, losing all motion.  Sleep almost impossible over that period.  Mild redness and little or no swelling as was commonly reported by others; pain was deep in shoulder joint and radiated from neck to elbow.

                                                After 4-5 hours of the 2nd dose of Moderna I start to get pain in the arms and legs, feel weir at night time like light headache, dizziness and uncomfortable in breathing that wake me up at the middle of the night. Blood pressure elevated higher than normal. After a week the arm&#39;s pain getting better,but the legs&#39; pain gets worse. Since then my legs pain and join pain getting worse and worse, its hurts with activities and no pain at rest while seat or lay down. I&#39;ve been through many doctors visits including the Urgent Care, ER, Neurology and rheumatology doctors and had many kinds of testing and found nothing wrong with my heart, lung, blood clots in the legs, Both of my legs are just progressively getting worse,both legs are getting more pain and weaker, that make me hard to lift them up for walking. I almost can&#39;t work now. I also feel so tired, dizzy and headache for 2-3 days each time that come and go since the 2nd dose of the vaccine. I&#39;ll have the MRI tests on 06/05/2021 and 06/06/2021.

He doesn&#39;t remember the first week in the hospital.  He was told he tested positive for COVID but other than receiving his vaccine he had very limited exposure to anyone or anywhere.  He said the only people he was around were not sick and they always wore a mask and washed their hands.  He feels the vaccine is what gave him COVID.

It never got better and in fact it got worse when he got his second vaccine.  Since then he has been working with many alternative modalities to try to improve the pain but he is getting frustrated by his lack of range of motion.  He worries that the weakness could lead to injury if he were to fall and try to brace himself. Exam today reveals decrease pain to motion secondary to pain in abduction, internal rotation.  There is no obvious deformity of the shoulder joint or acromioclavicular joint.  There is no crepitus.  Strength is intact.

The next day I was not alert, that night Feb 10, just before midnight I had a grand mal seizure . The ambulance and police were at my  home a little after midnight.  They took me to Essentia hospital emergency room.  I was there for observation for several hours.  I notified my VA doctor about what happened, he scheduled a brain scan. nothing showed that would indicate a medical brain issue. Subsequently; I lost my driving privileges completely for several months and currently am driving on a limited license, which is normal in the case of a seizure in our state. See continuation page:

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient was admitted for further stroke workup. He could not undergo MRI evaluation due to his pacemaker. He was evaluated by Neurology who reviewed the outside hospital imaging and noted an acute ischemia in the pons. He additionally noted mild bilateral carotid atherosclerosis and bilateral PCA  atherosclerotic stenosis. While admitted, the patient underwent an echocardiogram with bubble study. The results of the echo were limited dues to poor acoustic window availability and morbid obesity of the patient- Ejection fraction was 50% to 55%. Neurology advised dual-anti platelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg and plavix 75 mg daily for 3 months, then can resume monotherapy with aspirin 81 mg daily. Recommended continuing Lipitor 20 mg every evening and adding Niacin 500 mg daily due to elevated triglycerides. Neurology advised stopping Eliguis as the previous DVT and PE were provoked by long drive/ immobility and anticoagulation would not be needed from a stroke standpoint. His stroke is  not suspected to, be cardioembolic. Speech Therapy evaluated the patient and advised no further treatment. physical Therapy evaluated the patient and advised no further services were necessary upon discharge. The patient was comfortable with discharge. The remainder of his conditions were managed with his chronic medical therapy.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

Extreme dizziness (actually causing me to fall even when walking a few feet), extreme nausea (I think probably caused by the extreme dizziness), weakness, profound diaphoresis.  I was sick like I have never been in my life,  thought I might die, and when I was the most symptomatic actually wanted to die, I was so sick. Anyway, came on over about a 10 minute period gradually, and then was absolutely profoundly ill  for about 45 minutes. After about 1/2 hour or so was able to negotiate the 25 feet or so to my den couch, closed my eyes and lied down, with gradual relief coming and severe illness totally gone in about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. No return of any similar episode since. 24 hours later, still a little lethargic and mildly &#34;achey&#34; with some weakness, but not so bad and kind of what I was expecting.

                                                Extreme dizziness during the night, weakness and headache (took Tylenol 650 MG  for headache). Around 6 AM got out of bed to use toilet.  Wife heard a loud crash and found me in bathtub.  I don&#39;t recall falling but shower curtain fell down and have minor neck and back discomfort at this time.  Wife assisted me to crawl out of tub and she reported I &#34;passed out&#34; two more times for short durations as I crawled back into bed. Had profuse cold sweating episode for about 15 minutes.  Much less weakness now at 10 am, no dizziness but still a mild headache.

                                                Patient and wife called in to report patient experiencing 7/10 constant stomach pain, uncontrollable shaking, and numbness and tingling bilateral feet. Patient reports receiving his first covid vaccine dose 2-17-21 and experiencing symptoms, today Patient states, &#34;I can&#39;t feel the bottoms of my feet&#34; and &#34;it feels like I&#39;m going to throw up&#34;. Patient denies difficulty breathing. Patient was able to check pulse will on phone with triage nurse with pulse 93 and blood pressure 147/107. Patient requesting to have triage nurse call 911-EMS; HPI  The patient is a 69 year old male who states that he had the 1st dose of COVID vaccine yesterday morning.  The patient states that approximately 24 hours later, he developed stomach cramping.  He has nausea.  He denies any diarrhea.  He has not vomited.  Patient denies any cough or shortness of breath.  He complains of generalized weakness.  The patient also has chronic back pain.  Patient is noted to have a low-grade fever here, however, he does not report any fever. CHIEF COMPLAINT: WEAKNESS (per ems, pt got covid vaccine 24 hours ago, feeling weak and dizzy since 1500, tachycardia); Assessment/Plan DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition: 1. Hepatitis; The patient presents with a low-grade temperature, which isn&#39;t unexpected given that he received his COVID-19 vaccine yesterday.  However, the patient complains of abdominal pain.  Lab work does show elevated bilirubin, alk-phos, AST and ALT.  The patient has no previous history of this.  I did obtain both CT and ultrasound imaging of the gallbladder, which shows no pathology.  Subsequently, the patient was reassessed.  He is ambulated.  He is steady on his feet.  He does not desaturate.  He has no subjective complaints while walking.  I discussed the patient&#39;s lab abnormalities with him.  The patient prefers to go home and follow up for lab retesting on Monday.  Patient was given strict return instructions.  He will return should he develop any new or worsening symptoms.  He is going to have his labs redrawn on Monday and follow shortly with his primary care provider.  Given the normal imaging studies, I do think that these findings are likely related to a reaction to his vaccination.  This was discussed at length with the patient.  Patient is discharged home in stable condition.

He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

He continued to feel lightheaded the next day and came to the ED and was admitted for syncope workup. His workup was negative. On discharge, patient recalled that he received his 1st Covid vaccine.  His symptoms resolved after admission. This event was likely related to his vaccination.

                                                Day after first shot, experienced  some arm pain, elevated temperature, chills, very tired.  Of concern, blood pressure spiked to 149/78 (usually 120/70) and stayed elevated all day.  I contacted my cardiologist  late in the afternoon and he advised me to come in if the blood pressure did not return to normal the next day.  The next day, all symtoms disappeared and I felt normal.  When I received my second shot yesterday the doctor giving the injection said the blood pressure spike after the first shot was unusual and asked me to submit a VAERS  report.  My symptoms after the second shot  were a much more significant loss of mobility in the arm, which has returned to near normal.   but no blood pressure issue

                                                10 days after first dose of Moderna vaccine, I developed a very sore arm  starting with sharp pain at injection site and progressively radiating throughout upper arm and shoulder area, severe enough that I could not raise or use my arm.  This lasted about 24 hours and then started to dissipate throughout the next 24 hours.  I thought this was unusual because it was so long after the injection happened, and at the time of vaccination I had experienced very little arm pain.

                                                Approx 30 hours pot inj. I started shivering uncontrollably, went to bed for the majority of 18 hours. Alternating between shivers and sweating. Vertigo and dizziness made getting to the bathroom extremely difficult. Headache and body aches too. Woke up at 4pm on Sat. 2/27.  The headache may also have been a caffeine withdrawal effect since I slept through all day Saturday without having any coffee.  I was not warned not to overexert myself but 7 hours before I fell sick I was pushing a 8hp. Snowblower through heavy melting snow. I tired quickly so i stopped after ~ 30 minutes.  Felt much better Sunday morning

He had a hard time breathing as well so he went to the hospital.  They checked him out and ran tests but it was all in relation to the shot they thought.  Saturday he was very tired that he slept all day.  Sunday he was feeling better but had some issues with his vision and his peripheral vision went away for part of the day.

                                                This my second dose. Within five minutes I experienced lightheadedness and balance difficulties. These abated after twenty minutes. The injection site arm was very sore and grew even more sore throughout the evening and I had a slight headache about 7:00 PM, a rare occurrence for me -- I often only have one or two per year. The headache disappeared within about an hour after manifesting. By about 10:00 PM I was beginning to feel a general achiness all over, mostly manifested in my joints.  By the time that I awoke on Thursday, 03/25/2021, I was aching quite badly all over. By 5:00 PM on that date I felt as if I had chills and a fever but a check with a digital thermometer showed that my temperature was 96.4F.  By evening I was aching  even more severely and in pain - mostly in my joints and hands -- took to my couch and covered up where I dozed in and out. I took a generic acetaminophen around  7:00 PM.  When I got up from my couch around 10:30 PM on the 25th, the aching had abated quite drastically and by midnight the worst was over. My temperature registered 98.0F at 10:30 PM.  When I arose from bed around 11:00 AM on Friday the 26th, both my hands were still aching and paining badly but most of the other aches in my joints had dissipated. By 6:00 PM on the 26th  the severe pain in my hands had decreased to my customary levels of pain from arthritis.

                                                At ~ 5:30 pm, while driving my vision suddenly went, for lack of a better term, haywire.  Perhaps ?Vertigo?.  Vision was such that I had to pull over so as not to cause an accident.  It was as if each eye was looking at the same view differently and all jumbles.  Perhaps like looking through a prism and seeing multiple views of the same image ,  Able to stabilize it by covering one eye and viewing with the other, and vice versa.  Was able to drive again approximately 2-3 minutes away by keeping left eye closed; and able to see ok with one eve.  When stopped and opened other eye the incident stabilized and went away.  Was able to get out of vehicle and walk ok. The following day, experienced feverish symptoms throughout the day and had 101 degree fever by 9:30 pm.  Temperature settled down to 99 by 11 pm after resting.  That is the extent of the symptoms other that a slightly sore arm at the injection site which was fine by the next day.

Patient is not a great historian, and his story is confusing.  Patient says that after 3/13 he spoke to his orthopedic surgeon, who told him to get a Pfizer COVID vaccine next time. (Calls to the provider&#39;s office refute this story, office staff say the patient was told to not get any second doses).  Patient came to a walk-in vaccine clinic on 3/30/21 and received a Pfizer COVID vaccine (lot #ER8732), 18 days after his Moderna dose. Patient does not report any adverse effects from the second vaccine.   CDC was contacted through their NIPINFO form, and they confirmed that the patient does not need any additional doses.

Chills and muscle pain.  low fever when checked.  Treated with pain medication, ibuprofen, etc.    First week was Wednesday March 3.  other weeks were on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.  Only once a week.  Last night episode occurred, Wednesday April 14.  I do not think any weeks were skipped.  The last two episodes were milder.    I also have mild headaches and mild balance issues.  I had covid the last of December.  It is possible that the headaches and balance issues are from that.

A new stroke 24 hours after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccination Moderna  On Tuesday April 6, 2021 the patient showered by himself, walked up and down stairs in the home and was able to walk with the assistance of a cane.  He received the Moderna vaccination second dose at 10:00am (I believe this was an adverse event caused by the vaccination)  Wednesday April 7th at approximately 1:30pm I noticed he was unresponsive prompting me to call 911. His MRI at Hospital clearly diagnosed him as having another stroke, causing patient to no longer walk and use the restroom without assistance.  He is still in the hospital. Hospitalization and Physical Therapy is needed to allow patient to continue practicing as an Attorney.

His friend told him by 2pm that he had a hard time having a conversation with him as he was only able to get out a few words and they didn&#39;t make sense. He had shaking, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, staggered when he walked and really doesn&#39;t have much memory of friday. He states his friend called the walk in clinic to see if he should go in and was told those were just normal side effects. Patient believes he had covid in the past month as he had altered taste and his friend had covid and was hospitalized with similar sx. He states his sense of taste is back to the saltiness that it was when he had covid. He reports that still on day 4 post vaccine, he doesn&#39;t feel he is mentally at baseline and is struggling to pull words out. He plans to make an appointment to see his physician today.

                                                Soreness in R thigh above patella developed in mid March Acute Flaring of R knee in late March 3/31/2021 with pain, heat, and swelling that progressed over two days to inability to flex knee, raise leg against gravity when supine. Symptoms in leg resolved over 2 weeks with PT.  R-foot began to swell 2 weeks later with pain over and below base of R toe that progressed with heat, swelling, and redness over lower R-foot. Physician thought knee problems may be due to gout because of presentation so a prescription for a methylprednisolone was made available (6 day taper  (21, 4 mg tabs) instituted within 24 hrs of severe foot symptoms). Pain, swelling, and temp. elevation of foot began to resolve within 8 hrs or steroids.

I will not follow guidelines that are against my best judgment for right or wrong.   I knew better then to get the second vaccine so quickly.  There was no research that indicated this was the optimum time frame.   The only justification was what was done during the trials, which was to rush it to market and garner the highest efficacy numbers.   As seen here, the outcome was anything but mild side effects and they continue.

                                                I woke up approximately Wednesday midnight with a tummy ache. I got out of bed a little woozy and proceeded to kitchen to have a bicarbonate of soda and blacked out and fell to the floor for a few seconds. I crawled to the bathroom for a bowel movement. I then went back to the kitchen for the bicarb walking at this time. Still a little woozy but okay. Went back to bed, realizing the area of the shoulder was very sore. Much more so than 1st shot. Very restless night. No treatment necessary.

What I want to report is this last week I had a re-occurring bout, but this time it was much worse and lasted for two days.  I had 100.5 fever, could not stand up without passing out and threw up.  In addition my blood pressure was dropping.  I was concerned about it happening again as I had not heard this was possible.  Am doing fine now.

                                                Following my second shot in my left arm on March 25, 2021, I am experiencing severe arm pain, especially when lifting my left arm. The pain initially began at the injection site, but has since spread to include the shoulder to elbow area.

My hands were the worst affected. To the point I have not been able to use them without severe pain. A steroid shot and drugs helps. Very debilitating.

                                                I started feeling bad the Sunday afternoon after the Friday afternoon injection.  Slight fatigue.  By Monday afternoon, I was feeling very light headed, very tired and very spaced out. I took my blood pressure at home.  It registered 205/105.  I immediately went to the ER near my home.  There the doctor tried to reduce my blood pressure with oral medication.   The doctor was not successful in reducing my blood pressure. After 6 hours in the ER I was transported and admitted to Hospital, for observation.  I was given an IV blood pressure medication prior to the  ride over to the hospital and it did come down with the top line at 150.  I was observed until 6 pm the next day.  Two hours before release my blood pressure was hovering around 180/95.  I had a number of test in the hospital.  Full blood workup, CT Scan, MRI of my brain and an Echo Cardiogram with a Saline IV solution.  All the test came back with a good result.  I have continued to have problems with balance, memory loss and concentration up to this day, 06/10/2021.  I have made a conscious decision not to take the second due to what I perceive as a dangerous reaction to the first vaccination.

                                                Took 600mg of Ibuprofen (200mg x3) orally at 7:45AM, 30 minutes later while viewing a medical webinar at my desk at home, I suddenly noticed significant itching of my entire hands which quickly became reddened and progressively swollen as the itching sensation become more generalized within 10-15 minutes. I got up from my chair to go tell my wife but as I walked a few paces, I became extremely weak with visual &#39;closing in&#39; as I barely prevented myself from collapsing to the floor / losing consciousness. At the same time my tongue was now thickened and malfunctioning making my spoken words to my wife almost unintelligible - all consistent with a CLASSIC ANAPHYLAXIS REACTION.  My wife helped me to the couch to recline where I carefully swallowed CHLORPHENIRAMINE 8MG, FAMOTIDINE 20MG; and 15 minutes later DIPHENHYDRAMINE 50MG (I did not have any Epinephrine available from prior &#39;bee sting kits&#39;). At no time was my breathing impaired nor was there any audible wheezing or dyspnea. After ~45 minutes I was improving noticeably, and after ~2-3 hours I had made a 100% recovery with no sequelae thereafter. Although I had taken my routine morning medications several HOURS PRIOR, nevertheless, (after purchasing several vials of Epinephrine 1mg/1mL for protection in case of another reaction), after this event and over the succeeding days I re-added each of those medications separately / one-at-a-time to ensure that NONE of those was the offending agent - NO problems ensued. For obvious reasons, I have 100% AVOIDED ingesting Ibuprofen or other typical NSAIDs since this episode (although my routine single daily aspirin tablet has presented no problems). BOTTOM LINE: DESPITE HAVING USED IBUPROFEN 400MG OR 600MG PERHAPS 1-2 TIMES WEEKLY AS NEEDED FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT OVER MANY YEARS, NEVER UNTIL THIS ANAPHYLACTIC EPISODE 11 DAYS AFTER MY SECOND DOSE OF MODERNA&#39;S COVID-19 VACCINE HAD THERE EVER BEEN ANY TYPE OF ADVERSE REACTION TO IBUPROFEN WHATSOEVER.

                                                I began experiencing muscle aches, chills, night sweats, shortness of breath, blurred vision, dizziness and a nagging headache about 2 days after the first Moderna injection. These symptoms continued for well over a week but gradually got better each day for over a week. I monitored my body temperature and it was continuously normal and I never lost sense of taste or smell.

Then apparently I blacked out for approximately 5 minutes and my wife noticed and tried to rouse me. When I came to, I was still dizzy and went to lie down. Symptoms abated within a half hour or so. After about 2 hours, following phone calls to primary care Dr., we went to hospital ER for examination. Following intake we were seen by ER Dr. after approx. 7 hours.

Rolled back onto my back, let my head clear, turned to my right, and got dizzy again.  Felt nauseous, but did not vomit.  Problem was worse with eyes closed than with eyes open.  Spent most of the day  in bed.  Vertigo slightly better on day 2 after vaccination, took Dramamine after consult with doctor.  Much better on day 3.  Essentially back to normal on day 4, but do experience slight dizziness upon waking before getting out of bed.

                                                Vertigo the morning after the injection; took 25 mg meclizine; rested for a few hours after which symptoms resolved to point where I could walk and function. Very slight effects  (like a heavy head - no headache) lingered for a few days. No medical attention sought.  Not sure if this is a consequence of the vaccination or a coincidence because I took the injection around 10:30 am and proceeded directly to join my relatives for a full day (eat, drink, beach, etc). Arrived home around 8:30 pm -   Around 3 yrs ago, I had dehydration induced vertigo (had to go to ER). Not sure if lack of hydration was the culprit here.   My concern is that with &#34;dizziness&#34; being a more common side effect of the vaccine (and vertigo also mentioned in some studies), I am concerned with the potential reaction after the second dose, when almost everyone we know who had side effects, got hit much harder after the second dose.

I try and walk 3 miles every day, but began to notice left leg discomfort and slight pain from my hip to my ankle when walking.  Do not notice this discomfort when sleeping or if my leg is propped up.  Feet are both fine and my right leg is fine, no pain.   Also notice that it is harder and slower getting out of bed in the morning and I get drowsy earlier at night than I used to.  By 9 PM I feel like I want to go to bed.

My primary care phuysician recoemneded that I go to ER on 2/23/21 to have Cat Scan (negative), EKG (normal), blood work (normal except high glucose reading). ER doctor diagnosis was peripheral vertigo not central and discharged me with recomendation to take OTC meclizine twice daily. The spinning side effect has virtually disappeared, still some lightheaded feeling and persistent equilibrium./balance problems exist that prevemt from me driving and performing most daily activities. My Chiropractor has prefromed the  Epley Maneuver twice now but has had very little impact on my equilibrium and balance issues, I have an appointment with a specialist Nuerotologist on March 10, 2021

Fortunately, the vomiting relieved the nausea, and Acetaminaphen broke the fever. Happily, after a very long night&#39;s sleep, the only remaining side effects are continuing fatigue and slightly sore arms.  Note: Form did not allow me to answer below about mild side effects from second shingles vaccine dose I had during the past year. Effects included chills, mild fever, headache, body aches, fatigue. The shots were given at the pharmacy in our local store, but I don&#39;t recall the date our other details.

                                                I had a horrid reaction to my second covid shot. I got it on Monday 3/15 and was fine Tuesday. I even walked for an hour on he beach with the dogs so I said ?this wasn?t that bad? ON THE MORNING OF 3/17. I woke up about 3 AM with a fever OF 104 and basically an inability to stand. I tried to get ofF the bed to go pee and fell to the floor from which I could not get up as I had no muscle control or ability to lift myself uo and using a small ladder t took a long time for me to be able to manage to get on my feet with my wife  assistance.  On the way to the bathroom i banged into walls almost falling again.  told me later I looked as though I had a stroke. I made it back to bed and my temp was 104.  Then 20 minutes later the process started all over again it?s me falling to the floor and not being able to get up. This time when i was finally  and my O2 at 80  heart rate 112 was able to get up after about 7 tries I again walked into walls making it to the bathroom. This whole process happened one more time but this time i took a cool shower to cleanup and get my temp down.  Got back to bed and took a Vicodin along with two Advil.  I woke up at 10 am. No fever, able to stand and walk no problem  I sure hope this is over. but tonight will tell. form Item below is checked patient died and there was no death

Shivering began at 1am and lasted until 6am.  Upon getting up I got real dizzy after urinating, decided to go back to bed, but could not figure out how to get back in, so I stood beside my bed until the dizziness went away.  At some point I must of figured I was ok as the next thing I know I&#39;m on the landing of the steps upstairs, which is 6 steps, and my son is saying to my wife &#34;I&#39;m calling an ambulance&#34;.  Upon arrival at Hospital. I heard them say he&#39;s severely dehydrated and his blood pressure is extremely low.  I also had a fractured right clavicle.  I was kept in the Hospital for 3 days.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history provided.).    On 15-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS (dizziness) and NAUSEA (nausea). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body) and RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department), HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure), DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), DIZZINESS (dizziness), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body), RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck) and NAUSEA (nausea) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   A pharmacist suggested the patient take Children&#39;s Benadryl followed by Zyrtec to help with the itching. These medicines have not helped alleviate his intense itching. On 1Apr2021, the patient collapsed and was taken to the emergency department. The patient was treated at the emergency department after he collapsed from low blood pressure. He was prescribed Hydroxyzine HCI 10mg for the itching by the emergency room physician, but the medicine has done nothing to alleviate the patient&#39;s symptoms.  Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Ras and nausea are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                After being vaccinated for the 2nd time with the Moderna vaccine on Feb. 27, 2021, I had an increased fever, temperature, weakness, coughing, and dizziness. All these symptoms continued for up to 2-3 days as heavy as, then gradually moved to my &#34;normal health&#34; after almost 7-days. During this period I took only Cetamol tablets based on the advice of my primary care physician on phone mesaging. Nowadays, I witness symptoms of tinnitus which appeared directly after the 2nd vaccine. The tinnitus was a wavy (up-down) case but it now a serious and continuous issue. This is something I did not witness or suffer from in the past. The tinnitus is impacting me a lot, and sometimes I can&#39;t sleep well.

                                                He got the vaccine, he came home and was very weak, maybe a little bit of a low grade temp.  Went to bed, got up the next morning and felt okay other than weakness and had to get a caregiver to help take care of his wife as he was not able to.  Had a temp last night of 101.9, weakness to the point that he is falling over, no equilibrium at all, not able to get himself up from the couch last night.  Very active gentleman for his age, so this is very unusual for him and it scared him that he was not able to get up.  He has a severe headache since having the vaccine.  He does have a large knot where he got the vaccine, as well as redness and soreness.  He is still feeling the same today, very very weak, no temp though.  4/22/21.  He did take 2 Advil for his temp yesterday and hasn&#39;t had anything today.

                                                Monday night pt. became ill, threw up and had a fever.  He went to bed, but around 11 pm he woke up disoriented, unable to walk.  Was helped to the bathroom, but was unable to get back to bed on his own.  Fell on his bottom.  I had to call our son to come pick him up and help him back to bed, unable to hold his own weight..  Had trouble sleeping.  Abt 1 pm needed help getting up again, same disorientation, also fell off the toilet and needed help getting back to the bed, unable to hold his own weight.  Finally fell asleep.  Next day seemed fine enough. Tuesday night, became ill again, went to bed.  Got up to go to the bathroom, was wobbly, but able to make it.  Was helped back, wobbly but able to walk. Trouble falling asleep, fever, chills.  Finally fell asleep at 3 am Wed morning.  I had to go to the doctor early, so left him sleeping in bed.  When I came back around 11 am, he was still sleeping, snoring loudly.  Became concerned.  Wouldn&#39;t wake up.  Called Paramedics.  CT scan at the hospital revealed a brain bleed.  Transported to hospital. Put on support for almost 2 weeks.  No progress, no response.  Finally support was discontinued and he died April 19th at 7:52 pm.

                                                Patient became unconscious the evening of 4/14/21.  This event occurred five days after his second Covid vaccination. Patient had just gotten up from a living room chair and was walking over to the stairs to go to the second floor when he became rigid, lost consciousness and fell backward.  911 was called by his girlfriend.  He was unconscious for a couple of minutes.  When EMT&#39;s arrived he was conscious but very groggy.  His blood pressure was 250/157.  He knew his name and year and SSN but did not correctly answer several other questions.  He was taken to ER.  After numerous tests over the course of several days, he was diagnosed as having a stroke.    In the ER, they performed CAT scans, EKG, blood work, urine test and chest xray.  Blood pressure remained high.  Complained of headaches.  Patient was also having trouble voiding urine in the ER so a foley catheter was inserted.  He was admitted to the hospital.  After admission, an MRI, echocardiogram and EEG were performed.  The MRI showed three small blood vessels had burst in his brain.  Echocardiogram showed functions were normal.  The EEG showed some slowing but no signs of seizure.  The conclusion was a stroke.  Physical and occupational therapy examined patient.  No need for further therapy.  Blood pressure remains slightly elevated but he does not appear at this time to have lost any physical or mental functions.  Patient does NOT have a history of high blood pressure or heart issues.  Tests showed his heart was functioning properly.  Per his family doctor, his BP ran approximately 124/64 when tested during the previous 12 months.

                                                I started pain in the left rotator cuff (shoulder) like a baseball pitch injury.  I know the type of injury as I used to pitch, however, I&#39;m right-handed.  The pain increased over the next few weeks and I lost the use of the left arm to lift or raise the arm.  It was still an issue at the time of the second shot Moderna [Lot# 047B21A 10-08-2021.] on 05/06/2021.  I mentioned it to the operator at the site.  A week later I was finally able to rotate my arm around with a lot of pain, but, no strength.   Today 05/22/2021 I can now use my arm at about 25% capacity and it seems to be improving.  My daughter knows of one other person with similar results.

                                                Patient stated before vaccination that he had no reaction to 1st dose of Moderna.15 minutes after injection, patient started feeling faint. When  speaking to him, he would look at me but didn&#39;t seem to understand what I was saying as he wasn&#39;t responding to questions. He said in a weak voice that he felt faint and hot and didn&#39;t communicate much other than that. He was shakey and sweaty. We gave him an ice pack for the back of his neck, took his blood pressure/pulse, and called an ambulance. BP was 110/64, pulse 101. About 10 minutes later he had to use the restroom and we assisted him to the restroom. Upon returning to the pharmacy, the paramedics were on scene and he was feeling and looking better. They took his BP again and it was 127/72. The paramedics stayed with him for a while, but he was unwilling to go to the ER. They took his BP again which was 139/85 and pulse 66. After paramedics left about a half an hour later, he stayed seated at the pharmacy and was supervised for another 20min. Patient stated he felt fine and went home.

                                                I experienced the shingles virus after my Moderna vaccine, resulting in an ear infection. I saw my doctor who prescribed two antibiotics and Gabapentin medication, which I am still on. My ear is not cleared up yet, I still have some opening to do.  Also for about 4 hours, I had very severe dizziness, I had to lie down, nausea to the point I could not get up.  As for today I am still have my ear infection but no nausea or dizziness.

                                                On 04/14/2021 patient lost his memory for about 3 - 4 hours starting at 1600.  I called paramedics who suggested that he needed to go to ER due to an abnormal EKG.  At the ER he was tested and Dr. concentrated on his memory loss, no mention about his heart report and he was sent home.  04/15/2021 I spoke with RN regarding the ECG report which I did not understand; she was concerned and suggested that patient return to the ER. The doctor called early on 04/16/2021 and demanded that patient go to the ER, he was having a heart attack and needed to get there immediately; the doctor called the ER and let them know we were on the way.  We arrived at the ER at approximately 0900 and another ECG was performed and it was noted that he was having trouble with his heart and a Cardiologist was assigned to him.  By 1600 the patient was having a pacemaker implanted into his left chest wall. The patient is now living with a pacemaker, but still suffering from dizziness, weakness, short of breath, and is now experiencing muscle or nerve pain on his feet, legs, and arms.  The 3 - 4 hours that the patient suffered memory loss on 04/14/2021 is memory he has not been able to recall up to this date; he continues suffering from short terms of memory loss where he can&#39;t recall where he placed certain objects.

Was confused , trying to give me his remote to do what with I wasn&#39;t sure.  He had trouble with getting ideas across.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal for him.  However, we called him this morning at 8:45 am and he was lucid, he stated that when he went home around 4 pm , his left arm , hand and face were numb.  He stated that he could not pick up his cap with his left hand.  Today he woke and feels normal.  He was lucid and able to present ideas in a normal manner.  He vaguely remembers coming back to the clinic yesterday.

I suddenly became very dizzy and had to hang onto my truck to keep from falling.   It has not happened again but I have felt light-headed ever since.  I am due to get my second shot on 5  FEB 2021.

Suspect the latter, though patient is convinced it is directly related to severe myalgias due to COVID vaccination.

                                                At first I only had a sore arm. By early Friday evening, the night after the vaccination, I began having severe steady pain in my left kidney, along with sharp shooting pain at the same location.  I also had the expected headache and fatigue. I took Tylenol during this time, and still am. I was pretty much totally bed-ridden for 4 days.  I called my doctor on Wednesday, February 17th to report the severe reaction in my left kidney. The nurse told me that as long as I felt better each day then to weather it out and get  the second shot (scheduled for March 11).  Although I am feeling a little better, I am still taking Tylenol for the pain in my kidney. My exhaustion is lessening.

Sitting at home talking with my wife ant two friends and started feeling &#34;dizzy&#34;. They said I started shaking and head rolled back and I was out for a minute. I did not know anything had happened when I opened my eyes.  They insisted that I go to the hospital.  EMS came and tested me on the way to hospital- all tests good. Same at the hospital- you may have the results.   Not a seizure, no high blood pressure, maybe vaccine reaction? they weren&#39;t sure what it was, and wanted to keep me overnight and I said no thanks. Home about 5 PM I feel fine.  Please let me know if you want to go over.

Couldn&#39;t sleep or get dressed.  Pain gradually subsided but 6 weeks later I still have some residual stiffness.  Reported to Publix corporate office who did not take the information.  They had me call the store directly.  Evidently there is no corporate follow-up for problems.

                                                102 degree fever starting about 10 hours after vaccination. The fever lasted the night of the injection, and the next two days. I was unable to sit up in bed without getting dizzy, had a headache, after walking 25 steps in my house I had to sit down due to shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat. Now, two weeks after vaccination I am experiencing a cough, syncope and occasional irregular heartbeat.

                                                Awoke Friday to the sensation of the room spinning. It settled after a while but came back somewhat less after breakfast but then resulted in vomitting. Repeat settling and return, vommitting after lunch. Found symptoms faded on and off but no more vomitting Friday. Unsteady walking due to imbalance. Saturday, more spinning but no vomiting. Sunday it seemed to resolve so long as I didn&#39;t look down or to my left while lying down. Monday mild imbalance so I visited my PCP,  who said it was likely BPPV, prescribed meclazine for the vertigo, and gave order for a physical therapist which I scheduled for Monday, 3/22/21 which was the earliest available appointment. Friday, 3/19, no problem

The next day my legs started to feel funky, but I had a strong 4 wheel rollator and I continued on to assist my wife with getting her first shot at . By the time we got to the  elevators, after walking about two blocks the legs were feeling worse. On the way out my wife noticed me walking poorly and after about one block my legs &#34;gave out&#34; completely and I collapsed.

He had no muscle strengle to get up.  I had to call a neighbor to help.  I called my dr office and they said to keep him hydrated and keep an eye on him.  That&#39;s all  My son came and stayed with us on Thursday, the two of us got him into bed.  He slept the night and when he woke in the morning he had his strength back.  I had him rest for the rest of the week. So very scary.

                                                28 days (March 20th) following 1st Moderna shot which was given on Feb 23rd, felt dizzy, weak and lightheaded leading to fainting (syncope).  Ambulance arrived and determined to take me to hospital after having 2nd syncope in their presence.  Remained in hospital overnight.  All vitals, heart and bloodwork were fine as seen by cardiac doctor and  determined it was dehydration.  Followed up with primary physician and told him I was urinating excessively.  He put me on Flomax 0.4 mg.  I had the 2nd Moderna shot on March 23rd and again was taken to the hospital on March 31st with same symptoms and near syncope and again was told it was clinical dehydration.  They told me to drink a combination of pedialite and water which I have been doing and I am still experiencing the dizziness, lightheadedness and weakness.  Woke up on April 4th and felt like my soul was being ripped from my body.  I honestly thought I was going to die. Looked on line and found forums of people experiencing similar symptoms.  Went to pharmacy and they recommended meclizine and have taken a clonipin for anxiety.  I am feeling better now, but worried about how long I will be experiencing these symptons.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

Have to use a cane with 3 feet for stability. I was undergoing severe pain throughout this time. Pain from my lower back, left hip and left leg to left knee.  Was given physical therapy through the VA for 6 weeks and that helped loosen my leg up, but still in serious pain. After 2 months i am still in moderate pain but it is slowly lessening. VA has precsribed both Chiropractic and Massage treatments for me in the future.  I have lost 2 months of work and hit hard financially.

He stayed one night and the hospital ran several tests like EKG, stress test and others. Found his results to be normal and was released on January 20, 2021. Even the moment he was released, he felt very dizzy but hospital was not concerned and thought maybe side effect of medication. He continued to feel dizzy, fuzzy brain and hard time staying awake during the day and sleeping through the night for the rest of the week. He passed sometime in the early hours of February 6, 2021. Doctor&#39;s suspicion is a blood clot. He has no history of blood clots, heart problems or any health issues.

                                                I developed severe, debilitating vertigo (extreme dizziness and nausea ), that lasted from 5:00 PM on Sunday 3/28/21 until 5:00 AM Monday 3/29/21 . My PCP suggested that I go to the hospital ER  that morning (3/29) where I spent about three hours. I was diagnosed with benign vertigo and was found to have a low potassium level. I experienced similar, but milder symptoms for about two weeks thereafter. The mild (but unpleasant)  symptoms continue to reoccur perhaps once/week.   I experienced similar but much milder symptoms following my second Moderna shot on 3/10/21.

SOME OSTEOARTHRITIS HAS BEEN DETECTED IN BOTH KNEES (6/10/21). THEORY IS THAT THE 2ND VACCINE OVERSTIMULATED IMMUNE RESPONSE AND HAS CAUSED ARTHRITIS FLARE UP IN BOTH KNEES. NOTHING HAS RELIEVED PAIN TO DATE.

                                                Was working and had a minor twisting injury to spine that has occurred occasionally in the past. However, it was one week post vaccine and it seemed as if the vaccine was attacking the areas of inflamation with a vengeance and it developed into an extreme pain syndrome of the lower back and pelvis region radiating down my right leg to my knee. Pain and symptoms lasted approx. 6 weeks. The pain was so bad I had trouble walking and standing. As advised by GP, Endocrinologist, Oncologist, and Orthopedist I seeked chiropractic relief x 3 visits, physical therapy x approx 6 visits, and finally accupuncture approx 6 visits before relief. Additionally I was advised by GP to take high dose Prednisone 40-30-25-20-15-10-5x3ea

                                                8 days after my first dose I woke up with vertigo and chest pain.  I called 911, the EMTs arrived within in minutes.  they checked my vitals, gave me an EKG.  EKG was ok .. blood pressure was very very high.  They took me to the ER.  There they took a chest x-ray (looked ok),  tested me for Covid (negative), tested enzyme for heart attack (negative). They kept me under observation for an hour plus.  Things stabilized so I was discharged.

He had never had these problems before. About 2 weeks later, he started having diarrhea all day every day. Saw doctor and only told to Imodium. This did not help the diarrhea. He started experiencing dizziness, worse confusion, and hallucinations in addition to the other symptoms. In early May, he started complaining of dizziness and the hallucinations got worse. He was admitted to hospital on May 14. The symptoms continued. His speech became garbled, and he became more confused at hospital. the diarrhea continued for more of 3 weeks

I thought it was just a reaction to the shot. 5 or 6 days later I ended up in the hospital with a bad infection (Sepsis) and while in the hospital went into fibrillation that would not stop.  They rushed me down to the OR to shock my heart back to a normal rhythm.  I was in the hospital for 8 days. Now I am on blood thinners and a drug to stablize my rhythm so it can&#39;t happen again. I have a new heart doctor who is doing much testing. I have never had a heart problem before I took the shot.

After 30 minutes,  when bile started coming up, I called the doctor&#39;s office for instructions; he said to go to the hospital emergency room immediately. By then, I was too weak to stand or walk any distance, so I called for an ambulance. Taken to Hospital(arrival about 9:00 AM) where i received Zofran intravenously, along with saline drip. Spasms gradually tapered off and stopped within an hour. I was kept for observation and rest the remainder of the day and the following night, then released from the hospital at 4:00 AM (!!) the next morning.

She was worried about an allergic reaction.  He did seem a little shaky.  They had him sit on a bench outside for fresh air.  He said this was helping.  I took his radial HR.  It was regular, 70 bpm.  I was unable to get his blood pressure due to a broken cuff.  He was feeling much better at that point.  He did eat breakfast.  He said his arm felt fine.  No rash or hives observed and no shortness of breath.   His case worker brought him some water.  We sat there for about 15 minutes.  He felt much better and the case worker said he seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.

Got up in middle of night and my legs would not support me, had to hold onto furniture in order to pull myself across room.  Morning, I get up and tend to lean forward when walking causing me to try and control my balance while walking at an excelerated speed.

The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

                                                My dad experienced a neurological lapse that lasted a few days, but most certainly for 30 minutes while on FaceTime with me. He closed his eyes, and began rubbing his head. He wasn?t making much sense, and then stood up and faced away from the camera. He asked ?are you with me?? And then didn?t respond when I told him we were behind him. He began stumbling and I shouted for my mom. She called 911, they ran an EKG which was abnormal (due to his heart conditions), however the CT Scan and all blood work and tests at the hospital came back normal (outside of a much lower than normal heart rate) so they discharged him. He does not recall the entire morning.  He has been fine since, as far as I know, but has been instructed not to drive.  He followed up with his cardiologist a few days later and he believed it was neurological.  The neurologist immediately dismissed the idea that this could be the vaccine, despite my pushing. So I am filling this out to ensure all bases are checked.  My dad got the second dose of COVID vaccination this afternoon

On 3/5/21 at 3:00 am woke from sleep with extreme chills, goosebumps on the skin, and physically shaking to warm up. I had on the bed a sheet, quilt, and heavy comforter. I used the toilet to urinate and was not sure that I could walk back to my bed due to nausea and weakness. After resting, I placed another wool blanket on the bed on top of the comforter. Eventually, I began to warm up. Nausea and fever continued.  Muscles and joints ached. I slept on and off until 7:00 am. I did not eat any breakfast due to continuing nausea. I drank coffee, sat in my reclining chair most of the morning. at 12:00 noon, I ate a bowl of potatte and chicken soup.  My tempereature at this time was 99.5. I did sleep in the afternoon. Later in the evening my temperture had gone down to 99.  Today, 3/06/21 at 8:00am, I feel normal, tired but normal.

Patient states he got up and went to the bathroom, got out of the bathroom took 3-4 steps and his legs from his knees down went weak, and he went down in slow motion, could not hold himself up. He could not get back up onto his feet, so he crawled back to bed and got up into bed. Then around 5:00 got up and went to the bathroom again, and walking was hard, but he used a cane, the same thing happened again, and his legs went under him and he fell backwards and ended up on his back. He laid there for a bit and got legs straightened out and his arms had not a lot of strength from elbows down. He crawled back into bed again and about 8:00 am got up and had trouble walking and had to use a computer chair to steady himself. Then sat for a while. Had trouble getting his lower body dressed and about 10:00 am felt as if he had no strength and was going to fall again so he called his doctor. He talked to the nurse who told him to take some Tylenol and see how he was in a couple hours. He said he could get around with a walker but felt as if his legs would not hold him up. Patient states he has stiffness in his legs, but not weakness. By that night was using the walker ok, by the next morning he stated he was walking fine and did not need a cane or walker.

On 16th March at 7:30 am I started to feel dizzy and out of balance and then suddenly my hearing in my right ear went and I had a sort of wind noise in my ear but no hearing. At approximately 1:00pmmy wife called our Doctor and he said that this could be a rare side effect of the Covid Vaccine and to allow up to 24 hours for the effect to resolve itself. By 4:00pm.the effect did resolve itself but returned at 10:00amon 18th March and lasted for 4 hours. Since then I have been OK with no further effects.

It was difficult to walk.  I stayed in bed most of the next day with right leg elevated, and using ice to help pain and swelling. My wife and I suspected Gout, however it would have been a first for me to have it.  By 3/19 it felt a little better, but right foot still swollen, and my wife and I noticed a pronounced vein from the right knee down. She got scared that it could be a blood clot, so we called Dr and he ordered ultra sound, which was done on 3/19 in afternoon, but technician said that saw &#34;nothing&#34;.  Today (3/20) foot still sore and it&#39;s hard to put wight on it still.

Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

                                                Got 2nd Moderna shot. 8 days later got extremely dizzy, felt pain all over body, threw up. Taken to hospital . Given blood transfusion that worked. Spent  5 days in ICU; 2 days in regular hospital room. NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT VACCINE CAUSED IT. Doctors say unlikely but possible so I felt I should report it since it was so close in time to getting vaccine and I never had those problems before. Blood pressure got so low that doctors say I would have died without the transfusion.      After 1st Moderna shot (Jan. 15,2021) had only slightly dizzy, heart rate increased significantly and blood pressure went very high. All of those 1st shot issues went away in about half an hour. Serious problems only occurred after 2nd shot. Scarred to get booster next year unless doctors find that vaccine was not the cause of problem.

Strangely my right hand was frozen open.  Was unable to make a fist or grasp a water bottle.  When I tried to close my right hand I had a weird sensation in my hand.  It felt like electricity flowing down my hand and into my 4 fingers.  Left hand was not effected.   Had the same effect when I woke up a couple times during the night.  When I got up on Saturday morning the problem with my hand was gone.  Still a bit stiff, was fatigued, headache and body aches.  Sore arm for a few days.

Pt. only has muscle function in the right side of his body due to his stroke damage. His wife immediately approached him in his chair and asked him what was wrong and all he was able to state was &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; before loosing consciousness and stopping breathing. 911 was immediately called and due to his wife being frail herself she was not able to remove him from his wheelchair to perform any CPR. EMS arrived and begin performing CPR until the DNR papers for pt. were located. Medical examiner came to the home and stated she did not feel that an autopsy was needed even though family had told her NUMEROUS times that pt. had received his second Covid vaccine the day prior. He was pronounced dead by the medical examiner and taken directly to the funeral home due to the DNR papers being present.

                                                several days after receiving the second vaccination I felt very tired....the tiredness did not go away it only lingered. Two weeks after second dose I began feeling dizzy and went to the hospital for a check up. That is when they discovered I had A-Fib.

                                                On May 9th my father started to not feel well. On May 16th he was admitted to the hospital with sepsis. He had 2 MRIs which concluded he has an infection in the bone of one of his toes. He was sent home after 5 days in the hospital with a PIC line where he has to be on 2 antibiotics and a blood thinner for 6 weeks. If infection doesn&#39;t resolve he will have to have toe amputated. Prior to Covid vaccines my father was very active and healthy. He could do things without distress. He can now barely walk too far because he is so weak.

I approached him and he was losing consciousness and starting turning pale. He was also profusely sweating. I called 911 and EMS soon arrived and took his vitals. His wife gave EMS his history and told them this happens when he has blood drawn. This did not happen after his first dose of Moderna vaccine. He was lying down on his side. EMS took an EKG and said his heart looked good. His blood pressure was 120/90. After 10 minutes patient said he was feeling fine and did not want to go to the hospital. He answered all of EMS&#39;s questions correctly such as &#34;Where are you?&#34; &#34;What year is it?&#34; &#34;Who is the president?&#34; &#34; How many quarters are in a dollar?&#34; Patient went home with his wife and said he will follow up with his doctor. I will call him tomorrow on 6-18-21 to see how he is doing.

On March 1, 2021, an ongoing weakness in legs was reported to Nurse Practioner. It was established that this was NOT Mysthenia Gravis. Physical Theraphy was suggested but only made it worse. Last week my leg completely lost any sense of strength to stand and I had to be helped to my seat. Numerous time I have not had the strength to move at all. At this point the condition is disabling   Physicians Comments: &#34; You had antibodies because you had Covid even after 6 months&#34;.  The vaccine did not do you any good&#34; (I cannot rule the fact that the vaccine is the cause of your leg weakness.&#34;   WE NEED GUIDANCE; NO KNOWS WHAT TO DO: Ambulatory and moderately active at the time vaccine was given; The condition is getting progressively worse. Would appreciate any guidance or help that the center can give us.

Although I have mild DJD in both knees, it seldom bothered me, and less than 1 month before the vaccination, I was able to hike 3 miles up &amp; down hills without knee pain. After onset of symptoms, pain was constant, 7/10 on most days, my knees were palpably effused, and I was having trouble getting out of bed and walking to the bathroom. I suspected a vaccine reaction, and consulted Orthopedist, who injected each of my knees with steroid. Now, 2 wks later, I am back to baseline, and am able to walk 2 miles without knee pain.

                                                Patient reports experiencing significant dizziness since receiving his first Covid vaccination 3/11/21. He has difficulty walking, he&#39;s unsteady on his feet, and he&#39;s experiencing vertigo-like symptoms. His symptoms have progressively worsened to the point of attempting to schedule an MRI but having concerns of stroke (slurred speech, facial droop) and was advised to go to the ER. Stroke-like symptoms resolved and MRI showed findings suspicious for CNS lymphoma vs a demyelinating process. Prior to the vaccination, he was very active and able to work in his wood shop.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

                                                I had no issues with the first Moderna dose, but 5 days after the 2nd dose I experienced chills, dizziness and slight nausea when up and moving.  This lasted 2 days and started going away on day 3, but the dizziness is still slightly  present.  Also, during this time I?ve continually monitored my BP and pulse.  My BP has been elevated averaging around 165/95 (my normal is close to 145/85).  Pulse has been steady averaging around 66-68 which is normal for me.  Today,  my BP is around 150/90 so it?s slowly getting back to normal on day 9 (post vaccine #2).   Also, I had no other symptoms and my temperature was steady at 97 degrees since the vaccination.  Thank you

                                                Pain in arm developed after several days. Pain continuing through today 2/24/2021. Soreness in arm not mediated by pain meds, including Tramadol 50 MG that I take for back problems. Injection site was never red nor swollen. Trouble lifting arm without pain. Limited mobility without pain. On scale of 1 to 10 with ten being worst, pain varies between 3 and 7 at times.  Also have developed partially uncontrolled high blood pressure not mediated by heart meds, chiefly losartan. Before first vaccine, I was taking 50 mg daily. Increased to 100 mg daily on 2/1/2021 without stabalizing BP. BP can range during day from 106/60 to 158/86 with Pulse in 60s.

                                                On February 18th - My dad started with fever/chills within the next day after getting his second shot, stopped eating/lost appetite, couldn&#39;t eat anything - couldn&#39;t eat any solid food - only had liquids and Ensure for 10 days.  He has also experienced pain in his chest pain (unclear if muscle pain).  He is still experiencing discomfort.    Has lost weight. Then got a little better for 2 days, then lost appetite and unable to get out of bed.  Then arm and legs swollen on 3/9/2021 but swelling has gone down today. He is conscious but is having a hard time getting out of bed and has no energy.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

This time around on Tuesday pt got a COVID vaccine and 6 hours after pt started feeling nauseous and 3 days after the vaccine had numbness in his feet b/l at first. Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there. Pt woke up this morning and went from his bed to his chair and since then pt was not able to get up from the chair.

V Safe stopped communicating by Friday, 3/19. I&#39;m trying to make the CDC aware that they are missing reportable adverse react because of limited follow-up. I developed itching at the injection site on 3/20 in the a.m. I note approximately a 15 cm area of erythema around the injection site. On 3/20, after a 5 mile walk I felt similar symptoms that I had in the first couple of days after the injection of lightheadedness and felt poorly enough to have to rest the remainder of the day. I am better today and was able to function, but not ready to resume exercise. How many others have had a delayed reaction that is being missed because V Safe stops the follow-up when initial signs &amp; symptoms disappear?

                                                At about 6 pm (I think) I fell asleep. I woke up at approximately 11 pm and was very disoriented to time and to surroundings.  I had no idea what had transpired since about mid-afternoon including whether I had eaten, or taken my medication.  I could not walk in a straight line and had to hold onto things to maintain my balance.  I tried to fix my medications for the weeks and became totally confused.  It was a small task that I simply could not comprehend.  I was not nauseous and was not dizzy.  I. finally ate something because I knew I should.  I felt totally wiped out.  It was as if I was having a stroke. I went to bed and by morning the symptoms had abated except for being tired and achy and a bit of a headache (which is not unusual).

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

Slept for about and hour. Awoke and felt I had to go to the bathroom - I could not feel or move my legs. Finally used my arms to swing legs over edge of sofa but could not feel or use them. I used the my arms to lift myself to standing position and lost control of bladder - not and accident - felt it totally empty at once. Feeling started to return to legs and I was able to walk to clean myself up. Slowly began to regain use of legs and to stop shuffling and dragging my feet. I was doing better by 6:00p.m. and the leg problem was almost gone the next day. No repeat of the bladder issue.

There were not problems needing the police.  We took it as a very real dream and he went back to bed.  Over the next few weeks, he experienced weakness and dizziness/vertigo  causing three falls.  Went to primary care physician who prescribed Antivert and is sending him for a CAT scan and to a neurologist for further evaluation (vestibuar neuritis?  labyrinthitis?).

                                                A few minutes after I had received the vaccine shot, I noticed a slight pain at the injection site, which lasted for about 48 hours.  I also noticed that my face was flushed and I experienced some light-headedness, which I reported to my care giver.  After being monitored for an hour with improved symptoms, I was discharged.  Subsequently, on April 8, 2021, I noticed pain, tenderness, slight redness, and itching at the injection site.  Contacted my caregiver and was told to take Benadryl and apply a cold compress to the site.  I also treated it with Cortaid.  Symptoms cleared up within 48 hours and have not recurred.

                                                After the first vaccination, I was tired for 24 hours. However, with the second vaccination, I began experiencing more serious symptoms or reactions. Serious shortness of breath, as if unable to get sufficient oxygen. Extremely tired. Headaches behind my eyes. It is normally very unusual for me to get headaches. Dizziness and loss of balance. Weak and impaired vision. Eyes very sensitive to sunlight. Changes in ability to taste foods and sometimes foods taste very different. Pain spikes - various muscle and joint pain spikes. These symptoms have lasted for the past 8 weeks. I feel like most of the symptoms are gradually subsiding, but the time period is too short to be sure (as some symptoms come and go). I am anxiously expecting them to subside in the near future. I am sending this information to you for the purposes of records and statistics. I really do not have a choice in accepting the vaccinations because I am in my 70s. My son developed cancer; so, I had to make sure I do not expose him.

                                                My father had a reaction soon after the first dose in which he vomited violently. The vomiting continued over the next several months but less frequent along with dizziness and fatigue. On April 10 he was admitted to the emergency room with low hemoglobin numbers. Things quickly escalated from there. He was admitted to the ICU and diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. After a month in the ICU, over 60 blood transfusions, 20 dialysis, multiple pharmaceutical treatments and a splenectomy, my father died on May 13.

Secondary to that is a day of mental confusion one week out from the injection after each shot.

                                                I got sick. I went to the gym after receiving the vaccine, and I didn&#39;t feel well. In the afternoon I began sweating profusely. The next morning I tried going to bathroom, but I was weak so I fell and hit my head. I landed hard on my back which resulted in severe back pain. I was taken to the ER and stayed 10 days in there. I was then transferred to a different hospital for 10 more days. I was under home health care for 5 weeks. I went to rehab center  because I was weak from side effects of Covid vaccine. I received physical and speech therapy. 4 months later, I am still under medical care receiving physical therapy under my neurologist. My neurologist referred me to  Clinic for follow up on June 24, 2021.

By April 7th the dizziness was even more concerning, I checked my blood pressure and it was a little high so I limited my caffeine aspirin etc. I was having brain fog, fatigue, dizziness and blurred vision. On April 29 I went to the doctor. I was examined and was prescribed meclizine. It did not seem to help at all. The headaches and all persisted about 2 months before the dizziness was not so bad. I still have the blurred vision and headache problems. My eyes seem like they cannot focus. I have been dealing with this for 3 months now.

The next 1/23 2021 my left leg developed the same problem but more severe.  My gait was severely affected. On 1/24 the right leg was better but  I could hardly put any weight on the left leg in the am hours. In the pm hours both legs got some better. On Monday 1/25 both legs were much better and both finally cleared up on 1/27.

The entire room was spinning and I could hardly walk due to poor balance.  Every time I moved my head, the vertigo would recur.  This caused nausea and vomiting so I spent much of the day in bed.  In the late afternoon, the vertigo lessened after I took an anti-emetic drug.  I only ate clear liquids the first day.  Since then, I have improved but still have mild morning vertigo.and mild fatigue.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  The patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown) on unknown date. On 29-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029K20A) for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   The patient stated that at some point after receiving the second vaccine, he began experiencing neuropathy that affected his balance and caused tingling.    Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, neuropathy that is affecting his balance and tingling, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I am incensed that I was not aware the the vaccination would (could) cause the worse Rheumatoid Arthritis flare I ever had.  The morning after the injection (very painful and I am used to many injections/IVs due to the RA) I had to crawl out my bedroom.  I was unable to walk due the RA  flare.  The staff at the POD indicated this was no different that a usual flu shot. HA!  I had to get a script for Methylprednisolone to alleviate the effects.  The following day I was back to normal.  Again I feel like we (collectively) are not being truthfully being informed.  At best this vaccine is in a raw state, effective I certainly hope so.

I lost my sense of smell and taste. I had not been anywhere where I could have had contact with someone who had covid to my knowledge.

At that time he was also noted to have low potassium and sodium, reports that he was given IVF and potassium repleted. He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet. Denies difficulty with swallowing, breathing or speech. No shooting pains down his legs, no change in sensation in saddle area, no loss of control of bowel or urinary movements.

                                                Was extremely tired on the 2nd day after the shot with no energy but then felt better.  4 days after the second shot developed dizziness when rolling over in bed or getting up from lying down.  Has continued for 2 days now.  Seems to be BVVP.

Clearly a systemic reaction to the vaccine.  The bursitis in my right shoulder precipitated a cascade of adverse effects that became quite debilitating, and from which I am still recovering. The bursitis in my right knew made squatting difficult for about a week, but that symptom is substantially gone.  Here is the sequence in more detail: Vaccinated (Moderna) on Feb 4; went to play tennis on Feb 10; had discomfort raising my right arm (racquet arm)  when hitting my topspin backhand which has a high follow through ; decided to instead practice slice backhand. Developed acute pain next pain. Could not raise my arm ab ove shoulder for weeks now.

                                                On February 21 I had my first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. The next morning I experienced a mild 24-hour flu with low fever, fatigue and diminished appetite. My left arm, where I had the injection, was mildly sore. The following day all was fine. At 10:40am March 21 I had the second Moderna vaccination at the same location. By 7pm that day I began to feel flu-like symptoms. By 9pm I had a fever of about 102 degrees, moderate chills and sweats. By midnight I could barely sit up in bed to go to the bathroom, and had to steady myself on the walls as I walked. At one point during the night I began gasping for air and breathing hoarsely. I woke up hourly all night. Throughout Monday the weakness continued. I was slightly nauseous, developed mild diarrhea, and emptied the bowels. Zero appetite; drank lots of cold water. Slept the same as Sunday night with occasional chills and sweats. No more gasping episodes though. Tuesday ? Thursday I improved very gradually. Ate small amounts of plain yogurt, then plain toast. A low-grade fever came and went. I rested in bed all day and slept fitfully. Still very weak. Fast forward to March 31, 10 days after the shot. My appetite is OK now, no fever for several days, energy level about 85% of normal. I am very appreciative of getting the vaccine. The intense reaction to the second injection was startling, as my health has generally been excellent. I have masked and kept socially distant since last March.

                                                Patient received first COVID vaccine on 2/6/2021 and second vaccine on 3/6/2021. Patient presented to Hospital on 4/09/2021 for persistent nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria and jaundice. Patient reported a 1 month history of intermittent nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, feeling dizzy and weak, poor appetite. Patient had a colonoscopy ~2 weeks prior admission to hospital for cancer screening purposes which was unremarkable and labs done by his primary care at that time were all normal (per admitting physician&#39;s note). At hospital, patient was found to have evidence of hemolytic anemia thought to be autoimmune in nature with a positive direct antiglobulin. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital on 4/11/2021 for further workup. Patient is still currently admitted to hospital. Oncology was consulted for workup of pancytopenia and suspected warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Throughout admission, the patient&#39;s platelets have ranged between 59-154 k/µL and hemoglobin has ranged 4.5-8.6 g/dL with no documented history of thrombocytopenia or anemia. Patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg x9 doses, prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg) x5 doses, prednisone 60 mg x1 dose, rituximab 740 mg (375 mg/m2)  x3 doses, and immune globulin 40 g x3 doses. Patient has also received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Given the timing of anemia and thrombocytopenia and unknown etiology, immune response to his COVID vaccine is on the differential.

Very strange. Started to minimize reactions about 6-8 hours after waking up. I was unable to do my morning PT because of the weakness. I typically go to bed around 23:30, but on the 26th I went to bed at 21:00 and fell right to sleep. Next day (today) was back to 99.9999% normal. Did my morning PT (about 20 minutes plus 10 minutes on the bike). What I have is still soreness in knees. Luckily my pacemaker/defib didn&#39;t get set off by my heart incident. Feel free to call me, if you want.

                                                The day after the injection I noticed I had muscle aches and joint stiffness.  I read that this is a side affect so I thought it would go away.  It has not and if anything it has gotten worse over the past 5 weeks.  I Have to take Tylenol several times per day to be able to function.  While it does not stop the pain it does dull it somewhat.  Before the shot I was walking 2 miles per day for exercise but since that if I walk any distance my ankles hurt real bad.  I try to walk a couple of times per week but it hurts to walk any distance.  I do not know what to do.  I see my family care doctor next week and hopefully he can help me.

                                                About 12 hours (at midnight) after my second Moderna vaccination, I lost all bladder control and the use of both legs.  I didn&#39;t have much pain but was very tired.  Trying to get out of bed I fell, and my wife had to get me up.  I decided not to call 911 but to wait until the following morning to go to the ER, which I now know was a mistake.  By the morning the use of my legs was starting to return.  I have been told by medical professionals (my wife being one, an RN) that it was the symptoms of either Transverse Myelitis or Gillian-Barre Syndrome.  If it reoccurs, I am told to get to the ER immediately for a spinal tap.  I had no adverse effects from the first vaccination, nor have I ever had any reactions from any other vaccinations or medications.  I am not sure if this is the right place to report this.  If not, please forward that info to me.  Thank you.

The patient felt better for 1-1.5 days, then started to lose his balance, feel low on energy and felt achy and feverish again on May 31st. He kept thinking these symptoms may go away again, and wasn&#39;t sure if they were vaccine side effects or not.  The symptoms continued and the patient fell approximately 10 times the following 5-6 days. His speech also began to slur with a slight facial droop. He went to the ER on June 5th and had a CT, then MRI that confirmed a stroke. Looking back at the course of events, the patient believes his stroke occurred on May 31st. The patient stayed in the hospital for 3 days, then rehabilitation hospital for 14 day receiving inpatient therapy.

                                                Patient received vaccination at clinic and was in the waiting area for the 15 minute monitoring time. About 5 minutes into the waiting time, patient said he was getting light headed. It was noticed he was taking deep, sharp breaths causing his mask to go in his mouth. We switched him to a chair with arms and asked him to remove his jacket and called 911 as a precautionary as the breathing pattern was not improving.  EMS arrived to ask the patient how he was feeling and he said he had a dry mouth and was thirsty. At this time, it was aout 15 minutes after the vaccination. Patient refused transport and asked for water. I asked EMS if that was advisable now that he declined transport and it was beyond the 15 minutes. EMS was still near the patient. Patient was provided water and was able to remove his mask to drink and was much more coherent afterwards. He stayed in the pharmacy area about 20 minutes. He was asked to have his wife drive, which he refused.

                                                Patient was into the clinic yesterday for his first COVID vaccine.  Patient had no contraindications for the vaccine.  Vaccine was administered to right deltoid.  Patient then was asked to sit in the waiting room for 15 minutes for observation.  Patient was sitting in waiting room and developed shortness of breath and dizziness.  Patient vitals signed were obtained blood pressure was elevated 150s/100, heart rate 120s, oxygen level upper 90&#39;s on room air.  Patient was brought to an exam room where he could lay down via wheelchair.  Multiple vital signs were taken during the duration of his time at the clinic.  Blood pressure did come down to 140s/90s, sats remained in  upper 90s, heart rate came down to 70-80.  Patient remained dizzy the entire time.  Patient states that he has a history of idiopathic angioedema as well as a heart stent.  Patient goes on the explain that at different times he can have swelling internally.  He has had this happen several times in the past to his abdomen, saliva glands, tongue, as well as extremities.  Patient and his wife called his primary care physician and MD advised if episode did not resolve to go to the ER.  After waiting in the clinic for around 45 minutes the patients wife decided it would be best to go to the ER.  EMS was notified. Ambulance responded.  Patient was transported via ambulance to ER.    Patient wife was called the afternoon of the incident.  She states that patient was admitted to the hospital for observation.  He was treated with Benadryl, Pepcid, Decadron; CT of head was normal; blood pressure was still elevated; and they were not sure what was the cause of the episode.  I called the patient&#39;s wife on 1-29-21 to check on patient again.  His wife stated that he was been discharged home.  They were unsure what caused the episode and to follow up with primary physician in one week.  She states that at one week follow up visit they would discuss the need/desire for second COVID vaccine.  .

He was slow in his responses, and his wife noticed that was getting weaker and could not get up from the bathroom.  She feels it was more muscle weakness than anything.    On 1/29/21 he was bad most of the day  1/30/21 he started to come out of it little and knew what she was saying.   Now today 2/8/21 he is about 93% back to his baseline.  Nothing taken, but did speak to the doctor and he at that time told him not to take the 2nd vaccine.

Approx 13 minutes after receiving the dose, patient became weak, dizzy, and extremely diaphoretic.  Rapid response was called.  Patient was wheeled into exam room.  BG checked immediately and was 110.  Initial vitals showed HR 39 with BP 83/48.  Patient was transferred to exam table w/o incident.  He did not complain of CP or SOB.  Denies any throat swelling or itching.  He felt very weak and tired.  He continued to be extremely diaphoretic.  An 18G IV was introduced to the left forearm without incident.  He was connected to 1 L bag of 0.9% Normal Saline which was hung to bolus, running well without pressure.  EKG obtained and showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 43.  Possible ST changes in V1 and V2, but not diagnostic of ST elevations or depressions.  There is IVCD noted.  Patient has hx of AFib - not in Afib currently.  Reports on Eliquis instead of Coumadin.  EMS was contacted.    Physical exam performed revealed a bradycardic HR which was regular. No murmurs.  Lungs are clear.  Patient is extremely diaphoretic and pale.  He is alert and oriented x 3.  He is not in respiratory distress and shows no signs of oral swelling. No hives noted on his skin.  Vitals were rechecked at 3 mins and showed SaO2 at 95% and then 92%.  NC O2 applied at 2 L/min continuous and there was improvement to 95%.  He still denies any respiratory distress and was not manifesting any signs of respiratory distress.  Still denied any chest pain.  NS continued to infuse at bolus dose and BP recheck improved to 108/65 - patient was lying supine.  HR remained between 40-42.  At this time, the patient reported improved symptoms and he was not sweating as profusely as previously.  At this time EMS arrived.  Atropine was not administered in the clinic, but was prepared in expectation as a possible next step.  As patient&#39;s symptoms improved, but his vital signs remained altered, he was agreeable to transport to the hospital by EMS.  He was placed on stretcher and care was relinquished to EMS team.  Patient transported out of clinic in guarded condition.

                                                Vaccination at 9:00am. Some discomfort but not real pain in upper arm throughout the day, but became really tired later in the day and went to bed early. Got up to use the bathroom at about 11:30pm.  Swung my legs out of bed to the floor and went to stand up but fell forward to the carpet.  I had no strength in my legs or arms.  I laid on the floor about 10 minutes and could not roll over or sit up or get up to my knees.  My wife came around and helped me get up and back on the bed.  She then helped me down the hall to the bathroom, then back to the bedroom.  She helped me back to the bathroom one other time that night.  I stayed in bed for several hours and was very week and mostly sat all day,  I regained my strength over the next three days to where I could stand and walk, although I was very fatigued.  I am now about 9 days later and feel pretty much normal but get fatigued and my balance is not normal.

                                                patient waited the 15 minutes sitting on a chair. He got up to make a second appt and passed out when he was being helped.  He fell and there was a loud thump.  When I ran out he was laying on his back and his eyes were open and looked glazed over.  He started talking as soon as I addressed him.  We called 911 because I was concerned of a head injury.  We elevated his feet and had him wait until help came.  He was able to get up and walk out with the policeman and had the paramedics look at him.  I don&#39;t believe he went with them to the hospital.

                                                Injection was given into the deltoid at an almost vertical angle.  After about two hours, and lasting five days, the left arm was extremely sore to the point that assistance was needed to don and remove clothing.  This is considered adverse as compared to the initial injection into the left bicep which resulted in absolutely no side effects.  I believe the location of the second shot drastically effected the outcome.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had nothing more than a sore arm after the vaccine and felt fine the next morning so I went to play golf.  On the 4th hole I started feeling light headed and after an hour or so went home and rested.  My resting heart rate after 20 minutes was 88 according to my watch.  It is normally 60-65.  My watch also indicated that my heart rate was 122 while playing golf.  My temperature was 100.5.  After a couple of hours resting my heart rate went down to 75 and temperature lowered to 99.  I felt fine the following morning but my vaccination site turned bright pink and started itching.  This continued for 2 days.  I have had no issues since Friday, March 5th.

On unknown date, the patient experienced sore arm, lightheadness, lasted for 3-4 days and went away.   On unknown date, the patients vitals were checked and the heart rate was elevated to 148 and was admitted to the hospital. EKG and pulse rate was irregular. The patient was diagnosed with A fib. Treatment included apixaban, metoprolol and fluids.  The patient received both doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome for the events, sore arm, lightheadness and A-fib was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I started having severe balance issues on the 10th and rapidly &#34;progressed&#34; to extreme weakness. I could not walk 50 feet to my parked truck without assistance and even that took me about 30 minutes. After getting home I collapsed on the garage floor and it took me 30 minutes to crawl into the house and finally get seated into a chair with the assistance of my wife. The next morning (3/11) I could walk around the house a bit (without walking stick or walker for help) but I am still a bit weaker (than normal). I have had Parkinsons for about two years but I have never had such an instance of weakness or profound immobility. I have not seen my doctor yet and will wait a while to see if conditions worsen.

                                                The day after (3/11/21) the vaccination at 9:30 PM I experienced shakes, as though very cold.  My pulse oximeter showed low blood oxygen (between 80 and 85%) and elevated heart rate (high 70&#39;s/low 80&#39;s).  [I took multiple readings to make sure the numbers were accurate.]  By 10 PM my temperature started to increase rapidly.  Max was around 101.5 to 102F.  Sweat profusely.  By about midnight the fever &#34;broke&#34; (dropped back to normal range).  This will sound odd, but I felt like I had been shown what a severe Covid-19 infection/disease would look like if I were to become seriously ill with the disease.  Felt light-headed on Friday (3/12/21).  [I had no reaction, other than some muscle soreness, from the first dose.The same day as and after the second injection I had soreness in my entire left bicep all day.  No other reactions that day.]

                                                Approximately 23 hours after administration of Moderna #2 vaccine, subject began loosing muscle strength and control, especially of the legs.  The symptoms became severe enough that he had trouble standing, walking and, ultimately, suffered a fall.  Normally, the subject is able to maintain all functions of independent daily living, exercises regularly and is able to walk more than 5 miles.  These symptoms were also present in similar severity, within a similar time frame after receiving Moderna #1 vaccination. The subject had received a positive test for Covid 19 in late November, 2020 and was largely asymptomatic.

                                                Initially after the second vaccine he had typical myalgias/arthralgias, especially shoulder/neck. On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

                                                On March 4 patient experienced vomiting. Early morning March 5 he fell and landed on his hip after being disoriented and experienced aches, weakness, and nausea without vomiting throughout the day. On March 6 he experienced excruciating pain in his left hip and went to the local emergency room following guidance from his primary care physician. He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker. On March 12 he received a cortisone shot and required emergency medical assistance to get into a personal vehicle with a family member who drove to the appointment. The next few days, the pain persisted, became worse, and spread throughout his body. On March 16 he was transported by emergency medical services to the local emergency room for treatment and was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia. On March 18 he was still being treated when he experienced cardiac arrest while being intubated. He was resuscitated and was on a ventilator being treated for a few more days but ultimately succumbed to sepsis on March 30.

I spoke with wife who stated she was with the patient today, he worked outside shoveling and snow blowing with the winter storm. She saw him minutes before 4pm (she estimated 3:58p) and he was his normal self, then she walked to another room, called out to him, he didn&#39;t respond, so she ran back to where he was and saw him slumped over and weak on the L, she immediately called 911. She has record on her phone of calling a family member (daughter?) about this at 4:01, right after she had called 911, so LKN consider just before 4pm.  Patient states he takes only medications for hypertension at home. Denies being on any blood thinners and no record of blood thinners in his chart. Denies recent surgeries, denies history of ICH, denies bleeding issues in the past, denies ever having had a prior stroke.  BG 122 on arrival. BP initially 121/84 then increased requiring some labetalol.

                                                He got his vaccine, and first his body hurt everywhere.  It was very painful and felt like everything in his body was hurting, aching.  He felt nauseated, had a bit of fever 100 degrees, and normally his temp is 97.5  He was miserable.  He couldn&#39;t do anything as he hurt so bad.  He felt that it would go away and waited 2 days and it didn&#39;t go away and was not able to get up to get anything to eat or drink.  called the neighbors who called 9-1-1 and the EMT&#39;s and took his VS and took a blood sample for his diabetes and said that his VS were normal and asked if he wanted to go to the hospital, and they did not see anything wrong with him and he declined and they left.  He thought that he would feel better, and started to, not nauseated.  He was also very dizzy and really could not walk.  His neighbor brought him a walker so he could get around otherwise he would fall down into a chair.  Finally after a couple of weeks felt like he would be able to stand up without falling down.  Now every time that he stands up he gets light headed, and is able to get around without any problems, and take care of himself, but has to be real careful with the vertigo that will not go away completely.  It&#39;s been 7 weeks and it&#39;s not completely gone and wonders if it&#39;s going to go away.   He has noticed that the more he gets up that it does improve.

                                                I received the vaccine on 4/28/2021 at 10:45am. No adverse effects that day, except for minor tenderness at the injection site. On the morning of 4/29/2021, about 7:30, I woke with a fever of 102. I had no appetite, and felt general flu-like symptoms--dizziness, etc. When I took Advil, my fever lessened. At about 1 pm I ate lunch as usual, and took more Advil in the afternoon for fever. At about 5 pm, I suffered a bout of severe muscle weakness, to the extent that I could not get myself to the bathroom unassisted, and required the help of 2 people to get me out of the bathroom and back to a chair in the living room. At the same time I had dry heaves, severe sweating, and physical exhaustion. I immediately fell asleep in the chair, and slept for 2 hours. When I woke, about 7:30pm, I felt a little better. I was able to take some fluids and a little food. I was also able to stand and walk with just a little support. By 9:30 that night I could stand and walk fairly steadily by myself. I slept well, and when I woke up the morning of 4/30, at about 7 am, I felt pretty much normal. I was steady on my feet, and my fever was down. I had a little dizziness on exertion, but fairly minor, and it passed quickly.

                                                Patient passed away on 4/30/21. Wife reports that on 4/29/21, she found him in the garage in a &#34;pool of blood, face down&#34; after a fall. Upon finding him on  4/29/21, she took him to the emergency room where he had a CT scan. Patient was diagnosed with a &#34;concussion&#34; and sent back home, and was instructed to follow-up with his primary care provider on 4/30/21. On 4/30/21, patient was &#34;sleepy all day.&#34; On his way out of the house around 3:30, he suddenly put his hand on his wife and proceeded to collapse. The wife also fell, and by the time she gathered herself and went to check on her husband, he had passed away. An ambulance came to the house; CPR was performed for 40 minutes but &#34;they could not get him back.&#34; He was not transported to a medical center. An autopsy was not done, but the coroner informed patient&#39;s wife that he likely died from a &#34;clot, maybe a PE.&#34; Wife wonders how this could be, since he was on Plavix for 5 years. Wife does not feel that the COVID vaccine is to blame, but thought she should report the issue just in case. This writer is assisting wife of patient to fill out electronic report.

He went to the hospital, after he was able to move and breath.  He had x-rays, EKG&#39;s, blood tests and MRI&#39;s.  He saw many doctors and the last was cardiologist.  He was seen from 3/28/21 to recently by specialists.  He saw the cardiologist last week, and at that time he said that he had pericarditis and that the sac around his heart was inflamed.  The medications that he had been given were working but it was still working and he has a 5% chance of the problem coming back.  The pain is beginning to get stronger again and is going to call Dr. and see what else can be done, especially when he breaths in  he has pain and when he bends down it&#39;s painful as well, and he has a headache and other problems as well.  He was put on Colchicine for this.
