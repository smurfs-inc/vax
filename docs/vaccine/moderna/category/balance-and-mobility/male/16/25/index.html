                                                At approximately 2 PM on Wednesday the 10th, I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and feverish. Color drained from my face and I also began to lose track of the conversation I was having. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace of the conversation and eventually realized I couldn&#39;t remember what we were talking about. Looking back on the event now, I could only remember what was happening for around. 2 minute span before I forgot it. After losing my ability to form new memories, I began to lose old ones. I would look through pictures and not recognize faces, listen to songs and not remember the artists, and lose entire gaps of my past. My parents described my memory loss as that of a concussion but, to be frank, I don&#39;t remember much of any of it. All of my past memories have returned, but I still have yet to regain my memory from 2 PM to 10 PM of that day.

                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.

Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                I called my insurance provider&#39;s RN hotline at the onset of dizziness, which was then followed by a bout of ear ringing and nausea. I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

I immediately went out to help the patient and a technician called for EMS.  The patient woke up within 2 minutes and reported feeling dizzy, tired, and numb. While waiting for EMS to arrive, the patient was situated in a sitting position and I continued talking to him to keep him awake. EMS assessed him and took him out to the ambulance to wait for a relative to come.  It is unknown if the patient went to the emergency room or not.

                                                Patient stated he was feeling very faint and dizzy.  He also stated that he does not do well with vaccines.  When asked to explain, he stated that he always feels like he is going to faint.  I placed a cold ice pack on the back of the patient&#39;s neck and we stayed with him until he felt better, which was approximately 20 to 25 minutes.  We asked patient to remain for a total of 30 minutes, after which he stated he felt fine to leave.

Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Asthma and Eczema.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea). On 09-Apr-2021, DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea) had resolved. At the time of the report, DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) and COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, Colonoscopy: abnormal (abnormal) it appeared to be an &#34;ulcerative colitis&#34; on the entire colon.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medication mentioned topical cream NOS for eczema.  Treatment information mentioned IV Methylprednisolone and Metamizole. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Company comments This case concerns a 22-year-old female hospitalized with serious unexpected events of diarrhea hemorrhagic and colitis ulcerative, nonserious unexpected dizziness, malaise, and expected pyrexia, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea. Event onset 24 hours after second dose mRNA-1273. Serious event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

Patient stood up fine after receiving it, but when he reached over to the counter to grab his keys and phone, he collapsed and hit the counter, breaking the counter off the wall on the way down. Patient remained conscious and sat up and leaned against the wall for around 20 minutes. He was sweaty but did not want us to call an ambulance. After around 20 minutes of resting, the patient looked much better, was no longer sweating, and was able to stand up just fine. He said he felt totally back to normal now, he absolutely did NOT want us to call an ambulance or a family member to help him. He said he was more than fine driving home. He looked much better and then left.

                                                Waking up the day after my vaccination, my right arm was so sore I could barely lift it over my head. I also had minor chills and fever but that cleared up after I took acetaminophen. By Friday (two days after my vaccination) the soreness had reduced but I had developed a 4&#34; x 3&#34; rash around the injection site. It was both itchy and slightly painful, but not enough that I felt the need to take a painkiller. Today (five days after my vaccination) it has finally receded away.

I was working at the time and went to my local EMS station to get checked out. They checked my blood pressure and blood sugar. Blood pressure was normal but my blood sugar was low, around 68. They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

                                                Patient describes dizzy from panic attack/anxiety and lowered himself to the floor. Patient said he would be okay, it has happened twice before (before Dr. appointment). We helped him to a chair right next to him, I took his blood pressure (around 99/70). It was normal range, but low for the patient, he reported. We waited about 15 minutes and he said he was feeling okay and did not want EMS. We had the manager of the store take him home.
