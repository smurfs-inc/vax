                                                At approximately 2 PM on Wednesday the 10th, I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and feverish. Color drained from my face and I also began to lose track of the conversation I was having. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace of the conversation and eventually realized I couldn&#39;t remember what we were talking about. Looking back on the event now, I could only remember what was happening for around. 2 minute span before I forgot it. After losing my ability to form new memories, I began to lose old ones. I would look through pictures and not recognize faces, listen to songs and not remember the artists, and lose entire gaps of my past. My parents described my memory loss as that of a concussion but, to be frank, I don&#39;t remember much of any of it. All of my past memories have returned, but I still have yet to regain my memory from 2 PM to 10 PM of that day.

He soon regained consciousness (within about a minute) and was observed/attended to. 911 was called immediately as a precaution, and paramedics monitored his vital signs slowly helped him into a chair. He drank some water and a little electrolyte drink. He did not want to seek hospital treatment, and paramedics left.  He stated he was experiencing nausea while sitting in the chair, and said he started to feel like he was going to faint again.  Again 911 was called and paramedics attended to him, but he did not faint again. After resting in a chair and drinking some more water and some electrolyte drink, as well as cold compresses on his forehead and the back of the neck, he was eventually escorted by two store employees on a motorized scooter cart to his parent&#39;s car and went with his parent home (he did not want to seek hospital treatment).

                                                This patient had some dizziness after the shot and was apprehensive in receiving it. He claimed he felt dizzy and in seconds had slumped off of his chair. He was unresponsive for a few seconds only about 5-10 seconds and we gave him an IM Benadryl as a precaution. He awoke complaining of a funny feeling in the mouth and tongue but had no rash or redness or swelling to indicate an allergic reaction. We decide to monitor closely for an escalation of symptoms but to have a EpiPen handy, and call an EMT unit. His blood pressure was low at first at around 107/68  then quickly come up in about 10 minutes to 130/80. With no other issues we believe he had a vasovagal syncope but wanted the ER to make sure we were correct. I called and checked on him after he was at the ER. and the nurse stated that he was doing very well and that they had seen this happen with the vaccine at other site locations.

                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.     History obtained from:  ? patient                    ? outpatient clinicians  ? family                                  ? staff at facility  ? other                                   ? review of medical record as summarized below   Pt unable to provide reliable history because: ?

On further questioning after patient was responsive, he states that he had not eaten prior to coming for his vaccination.  He has only received a handful of vaccines and has never had the flu vaccine so he is unsure of his reaction.

Encouraged him to stay hydrated and to utilize Tylenol if fever, pain, or aches. Patient was alert and oriented when he left the vaccination room. After sanitizing the room for the next member, preparing the next member&#39;s shot, came out of the room to announce the next member and found the original patient face down on the floor of the warehouse. Witnesses stated he had fell to his knees from a sitting position and then hit his head on the floor with no more then 2 minutes going by (most likely less then 1 minute). Had the patient lay on the ground with legs elevated while he came to. Offered patient water and ice pack. Patient was able to call his parents, which I stayed by his side, until they arrived.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

                                                Vaccine was administered to patient.  Within 10 minutes of administration, the patient had an episode of syncope and fell out of his chair.  I immediately went out to help the patient and a technician called for EMS.  The patient woke up within 2 minutes and reported feeling dizzy, tired, and numb. While waiting for EMS to arrive, the patient was situated in a sitting position and I continued talking to him to keep him awake. EMS assessed him and took him out to the ambulance to wait for a relative to come.  It is unknown if the patient went to the emergency room or not.

Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the Moderna vaccine, this writer was called to the patient room by other staff.  The patient was extremely confused and not speaking to anyone.  He was gazing to the left and not making eye contact with this writer, who was loudly talking to the patient.  Multiple attempts were made to get the patient&#39;s attention with no success.  The patient then began to involuntarily raise his bent left arm in front of his face and then back down to his side.  In this writer&#39;s opinion, the patient was having a silent seizure.  This writer sat with the patient, who became aware approximately 15 seconds later.  He was able to answer questions and was quickly reoriented.  At this point this writer had the staff call 911 for further evaluation.  After answering basic questions appropriately., this writer gathered vital signs on the patient .  The first set of vitals were:   bp 88/48, pulse 60, respirations 14/min, oxygen saturation 93% on room air, temp 98.5.  After small conversation with the patient, another set of vitals were taken:   bp 94/70, pulse 68, respirations 15/min, oxygen saturation 95% on room air, temp 98.8.  We then had the patient drink some water, then had him lie down in the patient room until EMS arrived.  By the time they arrived, the patient was completed reoriented and laughing with office staff.  EMS evaluated the patient and deemed him safe to go home with his friend driving.  This writer walked the patient to the car to assess balance and coordination.  This writer informed the patient and his friend to call 911 if symptoms returned.  The patient agreed.

A couple of minutes later, I heard the gate rattle and rushed over to lower him to the floor gently.  I called out to employee and customer to call 911.  Then he woke up probably within 30 seconds.  I had him continue to lie there and talked with him.   He set up once for a couple of minutes and said he still felt light-headed so i had him lay back down and continued to talk with him.  Then paramedics came in and took over.  They placed him on a stretcher and took him, while he was still conscious while leaving.

                                                Patient reports routinely having spells of syncope with injections and still insisted on receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Gave injection into left deltoid. Had patient scoot up to table in immunization room with both legs fully under the table just in case there was an issue. I set the timer for 15 minutes and left him in the immunization room with his girlfriend, who also received a vaccine. A few moments later the girlfriend asked for our help stating he was feeling like he was going to pass out. I went into the IMZ room and checked with him. At the time, he was sweaty with a rapid hearbeat. I instructed him to take some deep breaths and went to get a cold paper towel to apply to his head. When I returned he had passed out, not responsive but still breathing, in his chair and his girlfriend was holding his head in her hand. We gently lowered his head to rest on the table while another associate called 911 per girlfriend&#39;s request. He began moaning a few moments later and was able to talk to us. He was very hot and sweaty, light headed and breathing rapidly. We applied a cooling pack to his forhead as he continued to lie his head on the table. He then said he might feel more comfortable lying on the floor. We assisted him to the floor, elevated his feet on a chair and placed his head on a roll of paper towels. At that time the paramedics showed up and said his blood pressure was fine and he was just having some hyperventilation. The paramedics got him back up in the chair and his girlfriend got him some apply juice. After about 30 minutes he was talking fine, shaking had stopped and his breathing a temp went back to normal

                                                Patient was seen in my office on 1/15/21 due to a reaction from the  covid. Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

                                                My left arm was sore starting a few minutes after the vaccine. This soreness last through that night. When I woke up the next day, my arm was extremely sore and I was very dizzy. Additionally, my pulse felt fast but my heartbeat seemed to have less strength. My breathing felt more shallow like I wasn&#39;t getting as much oxygen from the air that I breathed in as I should. For the first two weeks, the dizziness was very strong. Now, at the three-week mark, it is more manageable and life is somewhat returning to normal. I visited an ENT doctor and their diagnosis was that my dizziness was not being caused by a preexisting medical condition.  Their prediction was that I would be fine, though looking back, I downplayed the severity of my vertigo. At its worst, I felt that, when I went for a walk outside, the surface was the Earth was violently spinning through space, with me stuck to the surface. It felt paralyzing. My body felt almost stuck in shock. I was afraid I would be stuck with this dizziness for the rest of my life since it was so long-lasting. Now, I am taking ginger pills and am watching my sodium intake. I feel better but am extra vigilant about taking ginger and not stressing myself too much. I do not plan on getting a second shot since some of my symptoms mirror those of anaphylaxis.

                                                Around 11:30pm I started to get chills and my teeth started to chatter. At the same time my body was shaking slightly. I was laying on the couch during the start of it for the above events, this lasted for about 20&#43; minutes. Then I tried to get up to go to bed. I was shaking very badly at this point, teeth chattering a lot and I was very cold. I tried to use the bathroom and I couldn&#39;t even stand still to use the bathroom. My chest was also tightening and it was hard to breathe.   I went to bed to lay down and I was practically hyperventilating for about 15 minutes at a time and I would stop for a minute then it would start up again. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn&#39;t because I couldn&#39;t breathe and my chest was closing in, it felt like.   I called my parents in and they sat with me and gave me ibuprofen and benedryl. I started to feel better after about an hour. During that time, though, my body was extremely hot (but no fever) but I was still cold and had the chills. My head also was hurting like a headache and my eyes were really hot too. It was hard to get air and if I sat up I would get dizzy.

Episode lasted roughly 15 seconds at which point patient regained alertness. It was determined no epinephrine etc was needed. Pt was observed following episode until he was clearly okay to leave on his own accord, and no further medical attention would be necessary. Discussed follow up with PCP post event and to discuss appropriateness of receiving second dose.  Out of an abundance of caution, contacted patient later in the evening (about 1.5 hrs later) at home to check up and make sure he was still okay.

At 1am-2am, I could not move my left arm and my fever was 103.3F. I contacted urgent care who told me to take Ibuprofen as pain medication.  My symptoms did decrease although I still have today difficulty sleeping and sweat at night which I did not have before the vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Pharmacist heard a loud thud, and customer yelled &#34;call 911&#34; 911 was called, and patient was given a pillow under his head, and a blanket covering his body. He was unconscious for about 5 seconds, then came to. He was able to answer questions correctly like his name, and what year it is. Management came to help and take care of patient also. EMT arrived and took patient&#39;s BP and blood glucose levels. EMT recommended a snack because patient had not eaten yet today. Patient was given cheetos and water.

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

Patient stood up fine after receiving it, but when he reached over to the counter to grab his keys and phone, he collapsed and hit the counter, breaking the counter off the wall on the way down. Patient remained conscious and sat up and leaned against the wall for around 20 minutes. He was sweaty but did not want us to call an ambulance. After around 20 minutes of resting, the patient looked much better, was no longer sweating, and was able to stand up just fine. He said he felt totally back to normal now, he absolutely did NOT want us to call an ambulance or a family member to help him. He said he was more than fine driving home. He looked much better and then left.

I also had minor chills and fever but that cleared up after I took acetaminophen. By Friday (two days after my vaccination) the soreness had reduced but I had developed a 4&#34; x 3&#34; rash around the injection site. It was both itchy and slightly painful, but not enough that I felt the need to take a painkiller. Today (five days after my vaccination) it has finally receded away.

                                                Earlier today, a Moderna patient at 3213 experienced a 15-30 second seizure after receiving his 1st Moderna vaccine. Shortly after sitting down for his 15-minute post immunization observation period, patient X began seizing resulting in him falling to the ground from a seated position to his left side and seizing for about 15-20 seconds. Patient was positioned in a left lateral recumbent position. Code white was called and EMT arrived on site within 10 minutes.   Patient&#39;s immunization questionnaire did NOT have any contraindications that would warrant he should not receive the vaccine. Patient reported no allergies to medications/past immunizations/foods and reported no seizure and/or neurological condition.   Once recovered and at baseline, patient reported having a light breakfast this morning and also having a needle phobia that may have played a role in his adverse response.   Shortly after recovering, patient was coherent and aware of person, place, and time. He remained weak and fatigue and BP readings from EMT indicated hypotension. EKG was normal.   Patient&#39;s mother happened to be waiting outside in the car. One of my associates was able to call her in and we updated here on the event.   EMT recommended, and patient agreed, to be taken to the hospital for further examination.

After 15 more minutes he felt fine and was able to walk out of the store.   Later in the evening he called the pharmacy and told us his arm and tongue were tingling.  He was instructed to seek medical treatment if the symptoms became worse.  We spoke to him later and he stated that his symptoms went away without the use of medications.

I was working at the time and went to my local EMS station to get checked out. They checked my blood pressure and blood sugar. Blood pressure was normal but my blood sugar was low, around 68. They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

                                                I started feeling lightheaded and dizzy. They kept me for an extra 30 min. They brought me a chair to put my legs up. My heart started beating fast. I couldn&#39;t stand up and was scared to walk, so I was put on a stretcher. My throat started to close up. I was put in an ambulance and my throat swelled more on the trip to the ER. They gave me Benadryl and Prednisone. I was there for about 4 or 5 hours. I was okay after that. I checked the CDC site and it said I couldn&#39;t take the 2nd dose.

Patient said he would be okay, it has happened twice before (before Dr. appointment). We helped him to a chair right next to him, I took his blood pressure (around 99/70). It was normal range, but low for the patient, he reported. We waited about 15 minutes and he said he was feeling okay and did not want EMS. We had the manager of the store take him home.
