                                                At approximately 2 PM on Wednesday the 10th, I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and feverish. Color drained from my face and I also began to lose track of the conversation I was having. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace of the conversation and eventually realized I couldn&#39;t remember what we were talking about. Looking back on the event now, I could only remember what was happening for around. 2 minute span before I forgot it. After losing my ability to form new memories, I began to lose old ones. I would look through pictures and not recognize faces, listen to songs and not remember the artists, and lose entire gaps of my past. My parents described my memory loss as that of a concussion but, to be frank, I don&#39;t remember much of any of it. All of my past memories have returned, but I still have yet to regain my memory from 2 PM to 10 PM of that day.

He soon regained consciousness (within about a minute) and was observed/attended to. 911 was called immediately as a precaution, and paramedics monitored his vital signs slowly helped him into a chair. He drank some water and a little electrolyte drink. He did not want to seek hospital treatment, and paramedics left.  He stated he was experiencing nausea while sitting in the chair, and said he started to feel like he was going to faint again.  Again 911 was called and paramedics attended to him, but he did not faint again. After resting in a chair and drinking some more water and some electrolyte drink, as well as cold compresses on his forehead and the back of the neck, he was eventually escorted by two store employees on a motorized scooter cart to his parent&#39;s car and went with his parent home (he did not want to seek hospital treatment).

                                                This patient had some dizziness after the shot and was apprehensive in receiving it. He claimed he felt dizzy and in seconds had slumped off of his chair. He was unresponsive for a few seconds only about 5-10 seconds and we gave him an IM Benadryl as a precaution. He awoke complaining of a funny feeling in the mouth and tongue but had no rash or redness or swelling to indicate an allergic reaction. We decide to monitor closely for an escalation of symptoms but to have a EpiPen handy, and call an EMT unit. His blood pressure was low at first at around 107/68  then quickly come up in about 10 minutes to 130/80. With no other issues we believe he had a vasovagal syncope but wanted the ER to make sure we were correct. I called and checked on him after he was at the ER. and the nurse stated that he was doing very well and that they had seen this happen with the vaccine at other site locations.

                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.     History obtained from:  ? patient                    ? outpatient clinicians  ? family                                  ? staff at facility  ? other                                   ? review of medical record as summarized below   Pt unable to provide reliable history because: ?

Encouraged him to stay hydrated and to utilize Tylenol if fever, pain, or aches. Patient was alert and oriented when he left the vaccination room. After sanitizing the room for the next member, preparing the next member&#39;s shot, came out of the room to announce the next member and found the original patient face down on the floor of the warehouse. Witnesses stated he had fell to his knees from a sitting position and then hit his head on the floor with no more then 2 minutes going by (most likely less then 1 minute). Had the patient lay on the ground with legs elevated while he came to. Offered patient water and ice pack. Patient was able to call his parents, which I stayed by his side, until they arrived.

He did not respond when we moved to him, but within five seconds he was awake and asking what happened.  He was alert and sat in a chair for 30 minutes with no adverse effects from the fall.  He noted he only slept 3 hours the night before the vaccine and had not eaten anything that day. The patient refused any further medical care.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                I called my insurance provider&#39;s RN hotline at the onset of dizziness, which was then followed by a bout of ear ringing and nausea. I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

I immediately went out to help the patient and a technician called for EMS.  The patient woke up within 2 minutes and reported feeling dizzy, tired, and numb. While waiting for EMS to arrive, the patient was situated in a sitting position and I continued talking to him to keep him awake. EMS assessed him and took him out to the ambulance to wait for a relative to come.  It is unknown if the patient went to the emergency room or not.

We asked patient to remain for a total of 30 minutes, after which he stated he felt fine to leave.

Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

Patient was ok as I returned to the pharmacy to prepare for the next vaccination. Pt left the waiting area to shop, then returned after about 2 minutes and sat down in one of our chairs. Pt then announced that he was feeling dizzy. I immediately tried to reach the patient, by the time I reached him he had collapsed to the floor. The patient was unconscious for about 1 to 2 minutes, I had my staff call 911. Then the patient regained consciousness. The paramedics arrived and checked his vitals and watch him. His father arrived and took him home. He was feeling ok when he left the store.

                                                Patient had parked in the COVID vaccine waiting area, and was observed to fall forward onto his steering wheel within a few minutes of parking by 2 other participants waiting in the car next to him. One of them immediately notified one of the parking lot volunteers who came and got me within 1 minute of this observation. 2 students and I came quickly to the open drivers side door and began talking to assess the situation. Mr. Bannister appeared pale, mildly diaphoretic (sweating) and slightly confused as to the passage of time, but was able to state and spell his name and talk coherently about his circumstances. He stated that he was not allergic to anything that he knew about, and that he had no prior history of similar reactions to vaccines or medicines although he had not taken any shots in several years. He noted that he had not eaten anything since breakfast (now mid-afternoon). He described himself as initially feeling weak, faint, and nauseated with his vaccinated arm feeling heavy and numb. He also reported that he had a sensation of blurriness before passing out, but denied any spinning sensation, visual loss or ringing in the ears. There were no obviously visible abrasions or bleeding on his face or forehead. The nursing students brought a chair, and we elevated his legs and gave him some water to drink during the time we were monitoring his vital signs. He refused a cupcake because of the nausea, but as time progressed he gained facial color and was more comfortable in conversing. His hands had equal muscle grip and strength, visible fingernail beds were pink and his capillary refill was less than 3 seconds. Towards the end of our monitoring, he did accept some nuts and M &amp; Ms to eat. A University Safety Medical Report was completed by the appropriate safety personnel. He was fully AAO x 3 at the end of our monitoring, and stated that if he felt better he would drive to his apartment (less than 5 minutes away) but would wait for his girlfriend to get out of class if he did not feel fully capable of driving. We encouraged him to eat something light when he got home, to use cool water/warm water soaks at his shot site, exercise his arm, and to take an NSAID for pain relief the next day. We recommended that he eat something light before his second shot (which had already been scheduled), that he bring someone with him the next time, and as a precaution to wait 30 minutes following the second shot. He left at 3: 15 pm driving his car without any apparent difficulties. An online report was completed for the incident 04/20/2021.

                                                I asked the patient to wait for 30 minutes in the waiting room after the vaccine due to his history of rash with the meningitis shot. 5 minutes after the vaccine the patient stood up and looked disoriented and confused. I asked him if he was ok and he said that we was dizzy and wanted water. I had him sit down. I had my coworker 911 and I got him a bottle of water. He was sweating but felt better after drinking water. He reported to the Firemen that he had not eaten or drank that day yet. I asked him if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. The paramedics arrived and they checked his blood pressure. They said he looked good and was ok to leave.

He was dealing with nausea and dizziness, and the following day, he went to work, although he was feeling a bit ill.  While at work, he was found to have a fever, so he was sent home.  He has been having hot and cold flashes since then.  He has had a poor appetite.  He has had a dry mouth and trouble sleeping.  One day prior to admission, he then developed a chest pain that became constant and persisted, so he came into the emergency department on 05/19/2021 for further care. He has developed myocarditis after receiving the first of his Moderna Coronavirus Disease 19 vaccines.

He was instructed to sit and before we could help him into a chair he lost consciousness and fell. His fall was somewhat controlled by the technician. I then assessed the patient and determined he had a vasovagal episode and lifted his legs, he returned to consciousness within 10 seconds of raising his legs. I then allowed the patient to lie on the floor for approximately 20 minutes after which he felt better and returned to sitting . He then sat for about 15 more minutes until a family member was able to arrive. The patient reported no other adverse effects other than dizziness, lightheadedness, some trouble hearing and tingling fingers.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the Moderna vaccine, this writer was called to the patient room by other staff.  The patient was extremely confused and not speaking to anyone.  He was gazing to the left and not making eye contact with this writer, who was loudly talking to the patient.  Multiple attempts were made to get the patient&#39;s attention with no success.  The patient then began to involuntarily raise his bent left arm in front of his face and then back down to his side.  In this writer&#39;s opinion, the patient was having a silent seizure.  This writer sat with the patient, who became aware approximately 15 seconds later.  He was able to answer questions and was quickly reoriented.  At this point this writer had the staff call 911 for further evaluation.  After answering basic questions appropriately., this writer gathered vital signs on the patient .  The first set of vitals were:   bp 88/48, pulse 60, respirations 14/min, oxygen saturation 93% on room air, temp 98.5.  After small conversation with the patient, another set of vitals were taken:   bp 94/70, pulse 68, respirations 15/min, oxygen saturation 95% on room air, temp 98.8.  We then had the patient drink some water, then had him lie down in the patient room until EMS arrived.  By the time they arrived, the patient was completed reoriented and laughing with office staff.  EMS evaluated the patient and deemed him safe to go home with his friend driving.  This writer walked the patient to the car to assess balance and coordination.  This writer informed the patient and his friend to call 911 if symptoms returned.  The patient agreed.

A couple of minutes later, I heard the gate rattle and rushed over to lower him to the floor gently.  I called out to employee and customer to call 911.  Then he woke up probably within 30 seconds.  I had him continue to lie there and talked with him.   He set up once for a couple of minutes and said he still felt light-headed so i had him lay back down and continued to talk with him.  Then paramedics came in and took over.  They placed him on a stretcher and took him, while he was still conscious while leaving.

                                                Patient reports routinely having spells of syncope with injections and still insisted on receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Gave injection into left deltoid. Had patient scoot up to table in immunization room with both legs fully under the table just in case there was an issue. I set the timer for 15 minutes and left him in the immunization room with his girlfriend, who also received a vaccine. A few moments later the girlfriend asked for our help stating he was feeling like he was going to pass out. I went into the IMZ room and checked with him. At the time, he was sweaty with a rapid hearbeat. I instructed him to take some deep breaths and went to get a cold paper towel to apply to his head. When I returned he had passed out, not responsive but still breathing, in his chair and his girlfriend was holding his head in her hand. We gently lowered his head to rest on the table while another associate called 911 per girlfriend&#39;s request. He began moaning a few moments later and was able to talk to us. He was very hot and sweaty, light headed and breathing rapidly. We applied a cooling pack to his forhead as he continued to lie his head on the table. He then said he might feel more comfortable lying on the floor. We assisted him to the floor, elevated his feet on a chair and placed his head on a roll of paper towels. At that time the paramedics showed up and said his blood pressure was fine and he was just having some hyperventilation. The paramedics got him back up in the chair and his girlfriend got him some apply juice. After about 30 minutes he was talking fine, shaking had stopped and his breathing a temp went back to normal

When I brought the water to him he was very pale and said he felt like fainting.  We had him lay down and elevate feet which helped him feel better but was still hot so I applied a cold ice pack on head to help him feel less hot.  After about 10-15 minutes he felt better and stayed with us for about 45 mintues until he felt well enough to drive home.  I checked on him about 2 hours later and he was feeling much better.

He went to work and began to feel worse.  His co-workers noticed that he was not completing his paperwork correctly and he struggled doing his daily tasks.  He stated he felt like he was going to pass out and was out of breath.  His supervisor sent him home.  He attempted to drive home and swerved off the road.  He parked his car and got a ride home.  He slept for several hours.  He stated he is feeling better this evening.  Now he has a headache, but does not have dizziness, unsteady gait, or feeling like he will pass out.  I advised him that headache is a possible side effect of the vaccine, but the other symptoms are uncommon.  I asked him to seek medical attention if the symptoms come back.  He voiced understanding.

                                                Patient was seen in my office on 1/15/21 due to a reaction from the  covid. Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

                                                My left arm was sore starting a few minutes after the vaccine. This soreness last through that night. When I woke up the next day, my arm was extremely sore and I was very dizzy. Additionally, my pulse felt fast but my heartbeat seemed to have less strength. My breathing felt more shallow like I wasn&#39;t getting as much oxygen from the air that I breathed in as I should. For the first two weeks, the dizziness was very strong. Now, at the three-week mark, it is more manageable and life is somewhat returning to normal. I visited an ENT doctor and their diagnosis was that my dizziness was not being caused by a preexisting medical condition.  Their prediction was that I would be fine, though looking back, I downplayed the severity of my vertigo. At its worst, I felt that, when I went for a walk outside, the surface was the Earth was violently spinning through space, with me stuck to the surface. It felt paralyzing. My body felt almost stuck in shock. I was afraid I would be stuck with this dizziness for the rest of my life since it was so long-lasting. Now, I am taking ginger pills and am watching my sodium intake. I feel better but am extra vigilant about taking ginger and not stressing myself too much. I do not plan on getting a second shot since some of my symptoms mirror those of anaphylaxis.

                                                Pt Fainted shortly after receiving vaccination. Pt came for a moderna covid vaccine with his friend, both first doses. Pt said he &#34;fainted recently&#34; from a shot where he fainted &#34;for a couple minutes&#34; according to his nurse, and he was sure it was psychologically induced by anxiety. He said he was more mentally prepared this time. After I gave the dose to him and his friend, he got lightheaded and slowly started losing consciousness in his seat after a few minutes.   Pt was alert and responded to our questions. I quickly stepped out to give the pt a bottle of water, and upon coming back to the IMZ room, his friend said he urinated himself. He was less responsive, but still alert. I notified the technician. He started to turn pale and felt more cold. He pulse was weak. I encouraged the pt&#39;s friend to keep him alert while we call EMS. I reminded the pt to keep breathing.   The technician called EMS, and I stayed with the patient to kept him calm, but alert until EMS arrived. Pt slowly felt better after a few minutes (color return, and temperature normalized). Pt said he was okay, and he was able to walk. EMS arrived and tested blood sugar; he was within normal range. Pt did not need EMS service, and went home with friend.

He looked fine and sat looking at his phone for approximately 5 minutes. He then  stood and walked to pick up window and asked if it was normal to have stomach pains. I said no and asked if he felt dizzy. He said &#34;no&#34; then turned to go back to his chair. As soon as he turned he said &#34;now I feel dizzy&#34;. I told him to return to his chair and he suddenly crumbled to the floor. I had my technician call 911. After 1 to 2 seconds of being unresponsive he suddenly came to. I had him continue laying on floor for a couple minutes and then he got up on his own and went to the chair. We gave him a cool towel for his neck and had him lean his head forward and down onto a chair placed in front on him.  The paramedics came within minutes and found him to be OK.  After they left he continued sitting in the chair for approximately 10 more minutes while talking on the phone (to his parents, I think). He then left stating that he was now OK and that it probably happened because he was nervous

                                                Around 11:30pm I started to get chills and my teeth started to chatter. At the same time my body was shaking slightly. I was laying on the couch during the start of it for the above events, this lasted for about 20&#43; minutes. Then I tried to get up to go to bed. I was shaking very badly at this point, teeth chattering a lot and I was very cold. I tried to use the bathroom and I couldn&#39;t even stand still to use the bathroom. My chest was also tightening and it was hard to breathe.   I went to bed to lay down and I was practically hyperventilating for about 15 minutes at a time and I would stop for a minute then it would start up again. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn&#39;t because I couldn&#39;t breathe and my chest was closing in, it felt like.   I called my parents in and they sat with me and gave me ibuprofen and benedryl. I started to feel better after about an hour. During that time, though, my body was extremely hot (but no fever) but I was still cold and had the chills. My head also was hurting like a headache and my eyes were really hot too. It was hard to get air and if I sat up I would get dizzy.

Episode lasted roughly 15 seconds at which point patient regained alertness. It was determined no epinephrine etc was needed. Pt was observed following episode until he was clearly okay to leave on his own accord, and no further medical attention would be necessary. Discussed follow up with PCP post event and to discuss appropriateness of receiving second dose.  Out of an abundance of caution, contacted patient later in the evening (about 1.5 hrs later) at home to check up and make sure he was still okay.

He was conscious the whole time but didn&#39;t remember if he got the shot. 911 was called and I observed him while we waited for them to get here, he was never taken to the hospital. Paramedics observed and released him . Patient said he always gets nervous when he gets any type of shot or blood drawn and this type of situation has happened in the past. This was unknown to us when administering the vaccine.

I had nerve damage to my tongue from oral surgery so I dont know if its related. I started to develop vertigo today the 15th around 1pm. Vertigo has come and gone on waves. Have had a mild headache all day as well. In addition Ive had alot of trouble concentrating.

                                                Around 3 pm on 4/14/21, I started to feel very tired and I started to get a headache. Around 6 pm, I started to experience lower back pain and my legs began to throb and my whole body became very sensitive to touch. I took tylenol or ibuprofen every 4 hours for the rest of the night. This went on until Thursday 4/15/21, when the dizziness and throbbing headache started. Every time I would stand up I would become off balanced and need to hold on to something. I was still experiencing the lower back pain, leg throbbing and skin sensitivity but the dizziness and headache became much more intense. Around 9:30  pm on Thursday, I felt like I was hallucinating and was experiencing euphoria along with a fever. I did not sleep the night of 4/15 into 4/16. I was sweating profusely with a throbbing headache that would cause spinning when I would stand up. Around 3 am on 4/16, I fell asleep until around 4:30 am when I woke up in a pool of my own sweat. The body aches, leg pain and skin sensitivity went away along with my fever. Throughout Friday 4/16, I had a throbbing headache and was dizzy with no relief. This continued into Sunday 4/18 when I started to feel some relief. My headache was pretty much gone but the dizziness is still very much there. I have also an experienced elevated heart rate and respirations throughout the last 5 days.

                                                A little under 48 hours after receiving second Moderna injection, I woke up with vertigo. I have never had vertigo before. The room was spinning horizontally and it would subside after sitting up for a short while. Once it subsided when I was sitting up, I laid down and the spinning began again. I got into the shower (dumb idea) and the spinning was no longer occurring, but I still felt off-balance and got a bit nauseous. It was at its worst for the hour after I woke up, but gradually has subsided since then. I did some vertigo relief maneuvers and they&#39;ve helped, but I can tell I&#39;m not 100% back to normal as of writing (11:54am). I would say I&#39;m 90% back to normal. This could be a freak occurrence, but since I&#39;ve never experienced vertigo before, I have a feeling the vaccine I received two days prior may have something to do with it.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Asthma and Eczema.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea). On 09-Apr-2021, DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea) had resolved. At the time of the report, DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) and COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, Colonoscopy: abnormal (abnormal) it appeared to be an &#34;ulcerative colitis&#34; on the entire colon.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medication mentioned topical cream NOS for eczema.  Treatment information mentioned IV Methylprednisolone and Metamizole. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Company comments This case concerns a 22-year-old female hospitalized with serious unexpected events of diarrhea hemorrhagic and colitis ulcerative, nonserious unexpected dizziness, malaise, and expected pyrexia, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea. Event onset 24 hours after second dose mRNA-1273. Serious event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

When I got to him, he was unresponsive, but within seconds he became alert. He said he had a history of passing out after medical procedures (when seeing a md after finger surgery). He layed down for about 20 minutes, then sat back in chair. About 30 min after passing out, he said he was dizzy and passed out a 2nd time. He became alert after about 10 seconds. He was here about 30 more min then felt ok and left.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna vaccine. After receiving the vaccination and while waiting 15 minutes, the patient became extremely light-headed and passed out out of the chair. Patient immediately regained consciousness and was helped back into chair by myself and his brother. Patient was still dizzy. I immediately told one associate to call 911 and another associate was able to call for management. Afterwards, I told an associate to go grab the patient a water and some hard candy to elevate his blood glucose. I confirmed that the patient has not had seizures in the past. The patient stated that he had not eaten very much today (just a smoothie) and wasn&#39;t adequately hydrated. I stayed with the patient the whole time until the paramedics arrived and were able to test his vitals. The patient was eventually cleared to go home and went home with his brother.

                                                * Tuesday, March 16th, I received my first Moderna shot. No immediate symptoms, felt fine. * Thursday, March 25th (9 days post-vaccination), I was sitting at my desk and experienced some kind of visual distortion (my computer monitor bounced up and down 4 times in quick succession, even though I was perfectly still). Got up from my desk and laid down, and it went away. * Tuesday, March 30th (two weeks post-vaccination), I started experiencing persistent dizziness/imbalance. It was manageable for the first couple of days, and I still went about my daily activities. * Thursday, April 1st, symptoms got noticeably worse. I had a really bad episode of vertigo/dizziness in the afternoon. This spell of bad symptoms lasted until Saturday evening/Sunday morning. I wasn?t falling down, but I would describe it as akin to being on a boat in rough seas or a plane flying through a storm. Pressure in head and ears was intense. I?ve had longstanding tinnitus, but pitch/volume definitely seemed to change somewhat. My neck was incredibly stiff, and my throat felt somewhat ?tight? (tonsils or lymph nodes in neck felt enlarged). Took ibuprofen and Benadryl on and off over next several days. * Tuesday, April 27th, symptoms are ongoing. Still having imbalance, dizziness, and non-spinning vertigo, though less severe than previously.

When I got to him he was sweating and his arms were twitching. Even though he was alert, he was struggling  to straighten his arms. I made a 911 call and then administered one dose of epipen then within  a minute he thanked me for the epipen and he said he is feeling much better. Finally the paramedics came in and asked him if he still wants to go for further checkups. He agreed and left the store with the paramedics.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Pharmacist heard a loud thud, and customer yelled &#34;call 911&#34; 911 was called, and patient was given a pillow under his head, and a blanket covering his body. He was unconscious for about 5 seconds, then came to. He was able to answer questions correctly like his name, and what year it is. Management came to help and take care of patient also. EMT arrived and took patient&#39;s BP and blood glucose levels. EMT recommended a snack because patient had not eaten yet today. Patient was given cheetos and water. EMT stayed to monitor patient until his vitals returned to normal. Patient told EMT that he has fainted about 8 times previously after giving blood, but never after receiving a vaccine. Came to pick him up so he did not have to drive home. Patient stated he had chipped his tooth  when he fell from the chair.

EMS arrived and conversed with patient, took vitals, and recommended him to go home and rest as he was finally feeling better; overall, it took roughly 3 hours for symptoms to completely fade.

Gave patient water &amp; stayed with him, because &#34;he might faint&#34;.  Blood pressure was taken.  Initially was low, subsequent readings improved.  No Epipen was given.  He was talking &amp; seemed to be improving.  He was nervous, so 911 was called.  He was much better by the time the EMTs arrived.  The entire event including EMTs was @ 20 minutes.  He felt well enough to shop in the store after.

I helped the patient out of his chair and onto the floor. I retrieved an instant cold pack and prepared it. When I returned to the patient 45 seconds later, he said the coolness of the ground helped. He did not feel dizzy anymore but his fingers were still tingling. I gave him the cold pack to place behind his neck and provided him a bottle of water. I had him lie prone for another 5 minutes. When I re-assessed, he was no longer feeling any negative symptoms and he no longer looked pale nor felt clammy.

                                                About 8-10 minutes after injection, he was talking with a colleague in the observation area and  became dizzy and sat down. Then got &#34;really hot&#34;, then everything went black&#34;. Next thing he remembers is  2 colleagues assisting him to ambulate to ambulance. States his vitals were fine in the ambulance and at the hospital. IVF were given en route to hospital. Reports he &#34;never eats breakfast&#34;.  He was observed for ~ 2 hours at the hospital and released.

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

Patient stood up fine after receiving it, but when he reached over to the counter to grab his keys and phone, he collapsed and hit the counter, breaking the counter off the wall on the way down. Patient remained conscious and sat up and leaned against the wall for around 20 minutes. He was sweaty but did not want us to call an ambulance. After around 20 minutes of resting, the patient looked much better, was no longer sweating, and was able to stand up just fine. He said he felt totally back to normal now, he absolutely did NOT want us to call an ambulance or a family member to help him. He said he was more than fine driving home. He looked much better and then left.

                                                Waking up the day after my vaccination, my right arm was so sore I could barely lift it over my head. I also had minor chills and fever but that cleared up after I took acetaminophen. By Friday (two days after my vaccination) the soreness had reduced but I had developed a 4&#34; x 3&#34; rash around the injection site. It was both itchy and slightly painful, but not enough that I felt the need to take a painkiller. Today (five days after my vaccination) it has finally receded away.

                                                Earlier today, a Moderna patient at 3213 experienced a 15-30 second seizure after receiving his 1st Moderna vaccine. Shortly after sitting down for his 15-minute post immunization observation period, patient X began seizing resulting in him falling to the ground from a seated position to his left side and seizing for about 15-20 seconds. Patient was positioned in a left lateral recumbent position. Code white was called and EMT arrived on site within 10 minutes.   Patient&#39;s immunization questionnaire did NOT have any contraindications that would warrant he should not receive the vaccine. Patient reported no allergies to medications/past immunizations/foods and reported no seizure and/or neurological condition.   Once recovered and at baseline, patient reported having a light breakfast this morning and also having a needle phobia that may have played a role in his adverse response.   Shortly after recovering, patient was coherent and aware of person, place, and time. He remained weak and fatigue and BP readings from EMT indicated hypotension. EKG was normal.   Patient&#39;s mother happened to be waiting outside in the car. One of my associates was able to call her in and we updated here on the event.   EMT recommended, and patient agreed, to be taken to the hospital for further examination.

He was instructed to seek medical treatment if the symptoms became worse.  We spoke to him later and he stated that his symptoms went away without the use of medications.

He had a brief seizure while on the ground and someone called for help. I ran over and yelled for someone to call 911. He stopped seizing and stood up when he came to. I supported him and asked him to have a seat. He sat down and I asked how he felt and if he would like food or water. He said he felt okay but accepted the food and water. At that time, firefighters that had been shopping in the store arrived and started interviewing the patient. They took his pulse and blood sugar levels. Medics arrived and he continued to be monitored. After several minutes, he refused the ambulance and said he was feeling good enough to leave.

Pt reported to the RN that he was feeling dizzy (Client reported feeling dizziness after receiving his first dose as well.).  Pt also complained of piercing headache above his left eye and pain on the right side of his neck. The pain radiated down his entire left side of his body. The pt also felt tingling in the arm he received the vaccine in.  Vitals were initiated and water was provided to the pt. Ice packs were applied to the patients forehead and nape of the neck where he felt the pain.  Vitals NOT within normal limits. O2 saturation fluctuating and blood pressure was a bit elevated.  Pt reports having a history of hypertension, but could not accurately recall having taken the medication that morning. EMS was activated at 3:35 PM because the pts O2 saturated was fluctuating dangerously and interventions were not successful in relieving the patients symptoms.  Vitals were taken approximately 10 minutes apart. Vitals were not WNL. Pt continually reported that the pain was increasing and beginning to feel unbearable. It was noted that the patient had increasingly poor circulation in the arm he received the injection. O2 was taken on the opposite arm and saturation levels appeared normal.  EMS at 4 PM. Vitals were taken, all WNL. Patient left with EMS at 4:05 PM and was transported to Hospital.

                                                I received dose #1 of COVID and planned to walk through the store to shop. While walking passed the observation chair, I began to feel dizzy and decided to sit down. After I took a seat, I immediately began to feel numbness in my arm which spread to my entire body. I was also feeling a piercing headache with ringing in my ears and my dizziness was extreme. At this point I called for help to the individual who had administered my shot as I had feared I would have fainted. I was in this extreme state for approximately 3-5 minutes. The individual at the pharmacy then checked in on me, gave me a bottle of water and after drinking it I began to feel better. I was then able to walk around and buy some food. Approximately 20 minutes after that event and eating and drinking some food, I felt like I was back to normal. I am writing this 5 hours later, and I currently feel normal, with some soreness in my arm I received the vaccine in.

                                                Pt was sitting in post-vaccination area for his 15 minute observation time when he passed out after a few minutes. He had fallen onto the floor beside his chair. I immediately went out to pt. His eyes were fluttering. I shook pt and asked if he was okay. Pt opened his eyes and sat up seemed disoriented and said that he felt nauseated. I told pt to lay down on his back and elevate his feet on the chair, and told my technician to grab a bucket, an ice pack, and to call code white. We applied the ice pack to pts head. A member of management and an EMT who happened to be in the store reported over very shortly. Pt said he did think that he hit his head and his head did hurt. We asked the pt if he wanted us to call an ambulance. Pt said no, he was feeling a little better and he just wanted to wait a little bit and then finish his shopping. Pt was feeling better and was able to get back into the chair and sit. Pt appeared pale and we got him a drink of water. Pt sat and rested for sometime and after about an hour he said he was okay and was going to finish his shopping.

Stated that this &#34;always happens when I get shots or IVs&#34;. I double checked the consent and this was not disclosed to the pharmacist prior to injection. Held patient for 45 min, he refused an ambulance or more medical care, and he left. At time he left he stated he felt back to normal completely.

They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

I couldn&#39;t stand up and was scared to walk, so I was put on a stretcher. My throat started to close up. I was put in an ambulance and my throat swelled more on the trip to the ER. They gave me Benadryl and Prednisone. I was there for about 4 or 5 hours. I was okay after that. I checked the CDC site and it said I couldn&#39;t take the 2nd dose.

Patient said he would be okay, it has happened twice before (before Dr. appointment). We helped him to a chair right next to him, I took his blood pressure (around 99/70). It was normal range, but low for the patient, he reported. We waited about 15 minutes and he said he was feeling okay and did not want EMS. We had the manager of the store take him home.

Immediately after being vaccinated, I grew dizzy and felt my vision fading. I asked for some water and waited. Three minutes after vaccination, I lost consciousness and forcefully fell on the floor, scraping my head and biting the front of my tongue. I was immediately wheelchaired over to a nearby bench and tended to by a nurse and two doctors. I was sweating profusely, had a low heart rate and chills, and felt tired. After forty-five minutes, a bottle of water and a can of orange juice, I had recovered and was dismissed. I already had a ride waiting to take me home.

                                                Pt has received second dose of the Moderna series. He had completed his fifteen  minutes of observation and after standing to leave, he collapsed onto the floor hitting his head at 1152. Myself,RN rushed over and began to evaluate condition.  Pt was oriented x4 and stated he had become light headed after standing. Stated that his head hurt from hitting it on the floor. Began monitoring vital signs. Initial VS showed BP of 138/82, Pulse of 83, and respirations at 14. Applied oxygen per nasal cannula until we could monitor oxygen level which was found to be 96%. After continuing to  talk with pt, he again passed out while still laying down. We were able to awaken him and he was still oriented x4. . Second VS  at 1159 showed BP of 130/82, P 82, and 02 of 96.  Pt reported his history of seizures. Continued to monitor. Third set of VS at 1204 were BP 124/78, P 78, R 12, 02 96. Police arrived at 1205 and ambulance arrived at 1209. Pt refused to be taken in  by ambulance and continued to converse. We sat pt up to sitting position. At 1207, BP was 124/80, P 79, and 02 96. He was then moved up to sit in chair but after sitting there at approximately 1215, pt again passed out but was supported by the EMT.  After regaining consciousness, he then agreed to be transported to hospital via ambulance.

A minute or two later at most, we heard his mom yelling for us and I could see him kind of slumped over while she kept him sitting up. I ran out with an EpiPen and saw him on the bench, slumped forward but coming to - he was able to speak with us and answer questions (his name, DOB, today&#39;s date, where he was). He was dizzy and his face was pale and sweaty, but he said otherwise he was okay. We provided him water and Gatorade, which he drank and said it helped. We had them stay for 30 minutes from that point to monitor for improvement, and there were no further issues. We checked in with them before they left, and the patient said he was fine and back to normal.

While the pharmacist was checking his blood pressure (approximately 2-3 minutes following the vaccination), she notices the patient was starting to look pale and shut and squint his eyes as if he was having trouble focusing his vision.  The pharmacist questioned the patient to make sure he felt ok, and the patient said his vision was going black and he was  getting dizzy and lightheaded.  The pharmacist moved nearby objects out of the way to prepare to lay the patient on the ground. When returning to the patient, he was staring blankly, hunched over, unresponsive, no pulse felt on a 5 second check, and had rheum dripping from nose and eyes. At 12:50pm the pharmacist instructed technician to call 911. Patient was lowered to the floor in the supine position where he remained unresponsive and no pulse could be felt on a 10 second check, but chest rise could not be evaluated as patient started to have convulsions.  Convulsions ceased after approximately 15 seconds and patient started groaning and moving his head and said he could hear but he couldn&#39;t open his eyes yet. Patient remained supine and the Pharmacist continued to carry on conversation with patient until EMS arrived at 12:57pm to evaluate patient. EMS attributed  the instance to syncope related to the vaccine.  The patient denied ambulatory care to the hospital for any further evaluation.

                                                I woke up with pressure on my chest and pain on my left arm around the elbow. After a couple of minutes, I began to have a lot of cold sweat, and both the pressure in my chest and pain in my arm began to increase. Then I began feeling a tingling sensation on my neck/chin. After that, I felt lightheaded and decided to go to the hospital. At my arrival to the ER, I was given aspirin and heparin. I got a couple of EKGs and a chest X-Ray, as well as some blood work. I was then transferred to the medical center, where I had some more blood tests and EKGs done. I was also treated with Indocin, Lipitor and Aspirin. At around 9PM, I began feeling the pressure on my chest again, although with decreased intensity. I was given morphine and the pain went away. This event repeated at around 10AM next morning with the same outcome. After that I got an Echocardiogram, and began to be treated with Metoprolol. No other pain events happened for the rest of my stay at the hospital. On the next morning, April 26th, I was taken to an angiogram to rule out Coronary Dissection. After the test, I was discharged with a prescription for Metoprolol.

                                                Pt said he was disoriented , lightheaded and dizzy. We had him sit to observe him. He was flushed all over body and cold to touch. He stated he was feeling nauseous. I led him to a private space and had him lie down. He stated that his lips were tingling.  I gave him 25mg liquid diphenhydramine and continued to observe. He said throat was very dry and feeling worse. I contacted 911 and they came to the clinic to evaluate the patient. They checked blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate and rhythm. At 5:25 he decided he was feeling a little better and he refused transport by the ambulance. We arranged for an emergency contact to come pick him up.
