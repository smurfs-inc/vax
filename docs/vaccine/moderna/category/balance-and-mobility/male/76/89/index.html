Extreme pain in area of left arm/shoulder where the vaccine was given. Arm severely ached for 48 hours in any position, was very tender/painful to touch, and difficult to use or move. I&#39;m pretty tough where pain is concerned with past injuries (broken leg in 17 pieces, severely sprained ankles, broken ribs, broken tail bone from horse accident. This vaccination arm pain was right up there with the worst.

                                                I woke in the night on Monday, Feb. 1 to use the bathroom and when I stepped out of bed I felt a sharp pain in the outside ball of my right foot. I thought I had stepped on a needle. I could not step on that side of the foot as I walked without sharp pain. I immediately searched for what might be in my foot and found  nothing.  The pain continued through the night and into the morning.  My shot was in the left shoulder. I have concluded this is a neurological reaction (nerve pain) from the vaccine (Moderna). Never had this pain before.

I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

Everything  checked out ok, except my blood sugar was slightly low.  I quickly soon felt better, and resumed my volunteer shift. I don&#39;t know if the vaccine was related to this incident, but felt it best to report it to you.

But then a fever, chills and aches the day after vaccine. Two days after, still febrile and feeling worse and experiencing shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Fatigue, fever and lightheadedness continue for three more days. On the 6th day post-vaccine, taken to ER and admitted to hospital with a pneumonia and blood counts dangerously low. Received 3 blood transfusions and is receiving 2 different IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Still in hospital and waiting to see how blood counts go. I can?t say the vaccine CAUSED this, but it all happened rapidly, immediately following the vaccine.

This continued about 1 1/2 hrs. then he could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom; thus wetting himself multiple times during the night; Patient was restless for about 5 hrs. but still could not get up even with me (his spouse) trying to help.  He also could not understand how to help move his body to keep from falling out of bed (never fell out but I could not get his entire body on the bed until our daughter arrived around 9:30 am.  It took our grandson who is 6&#39;5&#34; tall &amp; 275 lbs. to help get patient up and walked him into our sunroon.  throughout the day, patient could not stand without help &amp; continued to urinate on himself.  He could, however, feed himself breakfast &amp; lunch.  At 7:30 pm grandson and daughter had to walk patient into bedroom.  patient could not walk without us telling him how and pushing his feet forward.  It took both grandson and daughter to pull him onto the bed as he collapsed when he got to the bed.  Patient slept until approximately midnight. at that time our daughter helped him to the bathroom and helped to change his underwear and tshirt which was wet from having a fever.  Afterward, patient was able to go to the bathroom by himself but was very tired.  He was able to walk outside with the help of a cane on 2/5/21 2 pm.  On 2/6/21, patient complained of his back hurting and itching.  We discovered he had shingles!  Not a full body rash but shingles on his left side around his waist.

Patient&#39;s doctor was called and at 5:30 pm patient was told to go to the hospital.  Doctor thought patient could have had a mini stroke.  Patient arrived at hospital at approximately 6:30 pm and underwent stroke test, COVID test, blood work; chest xrays and brain scans.  All were negative.

                                                I had my (Moderna) first dose yesterday.  Within ~6 hour the soreness level of the shoulder joint (but not especially the site of the jab) zoomed up to intense.  So much so, that simply lifting my arm slow-motion to the level of my eyes caused intense pain spasms.  Last night and this morning were equally severe.  Within the last hour or so, the pain level has diminished a bit.  NOTE: I know how people rate pain is super subjective.  In my case working as a geologist in a quarry a number of years ago, I was struck and pinned by a large boulder.  The ER crew would not give me a pain killer, so that they could monitor how the Jaw of Life was working (it broke, the boulder was too heavy), so I not surprisingly passed out several times from the pain level before being extricated.  Needless to say, this compound fracture of the tibia and fibula accident was a 10 of 10 pain level.  Yesterday&#39;s CV-19 jab pain level was an 8-9 of 10.  Nothing I read before yesterday&#39;s jab, Fauci et al, prepared me for this pain level.  So, is this normal???  My POV is, I think, atypical in this matter of pain. Should I be concerned about a return to normalcy right now (today / tomorrow) as well as for the second dose??  I HOPE THAT A MEDICAL PERSON WILL RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL - NOT SOME BOILER PLATE WORDS.

After a week of this the pain settled into my left hip. On the 9th day of pain and difficulty walking went to see my PCP. Treated me for bursitis of the left hip with a steroid injection to the left hip joint. Pain has gotten better but still painful. The vaccine was given at Urgent Care. Post vaccine visit was with PCP

After about 30 minutes he was able to sit up, stand and walk with a walker and assistance. generally has difficulty walking, but the concern was the rigidity and inability to bend for such a long period of time. After that he seems to be the same as he was prior to the vaccine.  Also, on 2/22/21 shortly after getting his vaccine he had a tremor in his hand (not sure which one) which stopped shortly after getting the vaccine.

Currently alert and resting.  States that patient had his 2nd covid vaccine yesterday AM and then develop chills and clammy skin last night.  Symptoms worsened today and patient became weak and fainted.  Was unconscious for about 5 minutes and while unconscious, mouth was open and drooling and became incontinent and eyes rolled back in head.  Is awake and alert now, but still weak and only able to take 1 or 2 steps.  No chest pain or breathing difficulty and no fever.  Feeling very nauseous.  Caller requesting prescription for zofran.      Yesterday AM 2nd vaccine. Last night chills. This AM feeling weak. Today at 11am he felt weak with ambulation. He fainted. Was unconscious for 5 min. Had drooping of the face. He was unresponsive during this time. Had incontinence of urine. Then became awake but very weak still. Only able to walk a few steps. He is communicating. No chest pain. No current fever. No shortness of breath. BP 107/75 with HR 70. He has been very nauseated. He is drinking only small sips of water. Does not seem like a usually COVID-19 vaccine reaction. Given the LOC with urinary incontinence and sustained weakness, I advised ER evaluation to rule out neurological issues. Pt&#39;s daughter in agreement. They will go to ER.  From Emergency Department:  Patient presenting with chief complaint of syncopal episode which was witnessed by his wife.  He reported the got dizzy and lightheaded and then passed out while seated.  The reported duration of his loss of consciousness was somewhat inconsistent, unclear how long he passed out for, there was however no postictal state.  He was not noted have any shaking or seizure activity, he did have an episode of urinary incontinence.  He has not been feeling well ever since receiving his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.  By the time of my exam patient states that he is completely asymptomatic, he states he is feeling much better after receiving IV fluids.  His lab work is remarkable for a slightly low sodium, compared to his previous levels which were many months ago.  Unclear of the acuity of this, although upon further discussion with the patient he has been drinking large amounts of water since his vaccine trying to stay hydrated.  I advised him to substitute to some electrolyte balanced fluids and to have his sodium rechecked by his PCP to ensure that this is transient.  With negative testing and resolution of his symptoms he is stable for discharge home.  Close return precautions were given.

He did call his doctor who was not available, spoke to the nurse and advised to go to the hospital.  He is weak and cannot drive so he did not go to the hospital.  He slept the rest of that day and the following day.  Then when he saw his doctor about 2 days ago, he described his reaction and told to report the reaction and that he would report it himself.  He was advised not to take the 2nd vaccination.  He is no longer having the heavy reaction, his muscles are aching and his vision is  blurred, especially on his back and the shoulder.   His doctor did do blood work at the office visit.

By noon felt lethargic and slept the remainder of day. He experienced incontinence while sleeping. He had trouble walking, and could not make it to the bathroom without support. While in the bathroom he went to the floor, (did not fall), could not get up. I had him crawl on his hands and knees to the living room. It&#39;s a though his muscles went soft. Remained lethargic the remainder of the day. Did not see a doctor.  Stayed at home and waited for symptoms to pass.

A neighbor is experiencing very SIMILAR symptoms. He is also 77 years old, and had his MODERNA booster shot about a week or so before I had mine, and we chatted this morning, so I concluded that our symptoms APPEAR to be related to the MODERNA booster.

                                                Neurological, including trigeminal neuralgia and one Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms.  Tried to complete online at library on 2/24/2021 but timed out at 20 minutes.  Item #18:  CDC asked to report any Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms (also trigeminal neuralgia is related to BP).  48 hrs post vax, mid-afternoon Sat, Feb 6th: Suddenly unable to comprehend book I was reading;  and  there was a physical sensation of irritation just inside my skull, wrapping around my brain (meninges?) -  it did not intrude into brain.  Felt lack of &#39;presence&#39; in room.  Slightly unstable on my feet.  Believed these were related to vaccine, would soon abate, but, also, that this would be no way to go through life!   These lasted 2-3 hours.  (I neither drink alcohol or take recreational drugs.)  About that time, a &#39;twinging&#39; precursor to trigeminal neuralgia began   uncertain whether it was TN?  Recurred every 3 hrs.  But then awakened at 6:30 a.m. by two painful TN jabs, repeated more strongly at 9:40 a,m.  At about 12:30 pm, return of light &#39;twinging&#39; sensation, then nothing  no recurrence.  3rd TN episode in 3 years, the briefest, the only one not requiring oxcarbazepine.  Checked for Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms (which I&#39;ve never had):  The left side of my mouth wasn&#39;t producing any saliva at all  none.  This improved very slowly, continuing for 5 or 6 days; by far the longest lasting symptom.  About Monday, the 8th, experienced an expanded  time warp driving to library  took forever to reach two roundabouts.  Lucid, alert, vision &amp; reactions normal.  Speed was a mile or two above limit.  No euphoria or nystagmus.  At library, conversation and work seemed normal.  Around the same time I had about an 18 hour complete memory loss with regard to medications.  Two dose periods in succession.    On Monday, Feb 8th, I called our 4 day a week neurologist.  He said the symptoms    were an immune response to the vaccine but that he&#39;s never seen them together before.  It was scary.  I&#39;m not going to take the second dose at this time.  And will depend upon PCP.       Filling out this form because you&#39;ve asked about any adverse reaction related to Bell&#39;s Palsy (which TN is closely related to).  I wonder how many others have experienced trigeminal neuralgia symptoms following vaccination?  It&#39;s a cumulative disease and devastating in advanced forms.  :-(

                                                Patient awoke the morning of March 5th feeling weak, fatigued, and unsteady. He went to his primary care provider 5 days later on the 10th of March, as his symptoms were not improving. He told his PCP there that the past few days he was suffering from unsteady gait, walking around like hes &#34;drunk&#34;, and bouncing off walls. It was thought his symptoms were caused by a low serum potassium value, so he was given a rx for potassium. 3 days later the patient presented to the emergency room where his problems persisted. He was still having trouble keeping balance when he walked around. One of the providers treating him reached out to neurology, who recommended that the patient be started on high dose steroids followed by a prednisone taper for tranverse myelitis, The patient was then admitted and treated at Hospital.

By the afternoon, he was so weak he could not lift himself out of the chair. Even with the help of another person, he was too weak to stand. I called for emergency help. He had a fever of 101, was vomiting, very disorientated, confused, could not understand what people were saying to him. At the hospital he continued to feel disorientated, had nausea, dizzyness, a headache, a fever of 104, was dehydrated. He was admitted to hospital and spent one night. Once home, he has begun to regain strength and other symptoms have diminished. Four days after coming home he is feeling stronger and more back to normal.

                                                At this point I am going to give you an account of my past 14 months health and how I know it is related to the covid virus.   i am sure i have had long covid  from december 2019 or january 2020 to the present based on symptoms i incurred on these dates. On my first night I ended up vomiting my guts out at 2:00 in the am. The following 2 weeks I had constant diarrhea.  At the end of those 2 weeks,  i ended up in emergency room. And this all happening when  i haven&#39;t&#39; vomited in over 30 years.  vital signs and blood work were good at the hospital and the drs were confused as to why i felt so bad. i returned home the next day where our permanent home is,  and 3 months later the covid thing surfaced. at first being thought of as a respiratory disease. then in the past months it is surfacing that it may now be considered a gastrointestinal disease that progresses to a respiratory disease. after checking the five main symptoms of long covid i discovered that i have at least 3 of the 5  common symptoms for this. Those being extreme fatigue, joint pain, and cough. In addition to the long covid symptoms, I have encountered tasting issues on and off again.  I have had many discussions with my primary care doctor, and no results or conclusive information came from my inquiries. Then on feb 12, 2021 I got my first moderna shot. About 2-3 weeks later I encountered a sharp pain in a muscle in my neck left side. Shortly thereafter I got very light headed. Then another  week later while  driving a motor home, I encountered a frightening experience with my eyes, and the neck pain and soreness was still there. My vision was very blurred and I was seeing double vision at different angles. I ended up at the medical center and was admitted for 4 days. Before I was admitted, I saw a local ophthalmologist here and he diagnosed me with a condition known as ?edema in optic nerve, inferior, consistent with optic nephropathy?. The symptom I had to get me to the doctor was I was losing eyesight in my left eye. After hd steroid treatment for 4 days, and a plethora of tests, including spinal tap, multiple mri?s, and probably over 20 blood tests (11 at one draw), I was released 3-18-2021 and still can?t see above the equator line of my left eye. And I also am extremely sensitive to light. I also have sensitivity inside my eye as best described as a soreness, especially when I try to look upwards. I have a follow up appt with the ophthalmologists that I first saw that advised me to get to the hospital. And that is on mar 26th 2021.  to mention another point of interest, my granddaughters boyfriends mother is a charge nurse at the emergency ward at the hospital, and she has said that they also have recently encountered emergency patients, who have recently received moderna, and are also having issues with eye problems. What problems in particular, I haven?t a clue at this time.  This is at the very least, extremely alarming to me, and I have no idea whether I may completely lose all function of my left eye., or not. But I adamantly feel this should be investigated by the cdc and any and all other agencies that should be involved.  I would be willing to have further discussions via phone or whatever to help you out with an investigation.

                                                Hallucinations; Dizziness; Fatigue; Nausea; Vomiting; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning her husband, a 77-year-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On an unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 01 Mar 2021, approximately three days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 03 Mar 2021, after second dose of vaccine, the patient experienced nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, and hallucinations. The event hallucinations were considered to be medically significant. The patient was also not been out bed for seven days. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not applicable.    The outcome of the events, hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events (dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding these event (hallucination) has been provided at this time. Medical history and concomitant medications are required for assessment. However, further information has been requested. However, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting are expected for mRNA1273.

Cream reduced itching for approximately 4 to 5 hours after each application.

Rolled out of bed, could not stand up or hardly walk to the bathroom.  Felt very faint, had to hold onto wall.  Was very sweaty, running temperature, cold sweats.  Just kept getting worse and thought about going to the ER and then decided to put it off until talking to somebody.  Called 2-1-1 and the lady told her that it was part of the side-effects to it.  She told her to call her doctor, and they were not in on the weekend.  This morning, the doctor called and asked if she had Corona, his other doctor retired and got this one the first of January.  Took 3 months to recover from the COVID and was on antibiotics, and told her because he have antibodies.  Feeling better, still having some achiness.

I found him bent over a chair in the bedroom @ 3 am and he couldn&#39;t straighten himself out. He needed help to go to the bathroom. He was very off balance. He hit his head into a cabinet that is above the toilet. I had to hold him  up as he used the toilet. He also had a problem getting back into the bed twice.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I was &#34;out&#34; for ~2 minutes, according to my MD wife. After 2-3 minutes ,I felt fine and went and played tennis 15 Minutes later. I don&#39;t think that I have never fainted in my life time. I take no prescriptions for anything. I do still have a sore shoulder from the fall, since I was sitting in a &#34;Bar stood&#34; at a counter at the  time  of the fall.

He did not have the core strength to even help him sit up. Sometime after he was assisted back on the couch around 4:30 am  he must of got back up and attempted to go to restroom because he was found on the floor with his arm and face resting on the love seat which looked as if he was trying to pull himself up. His wife found him in the morning around 11:00 am and he had been died for some time according to EMS. His death was unexpected. Even when contacting his doctors they were confused as to why he had passed away.  No autopsy was done but as of this moment he has not been cremated yet and is at Funeral Home.

                                                I experienced this rather immediate unexpected gradually increasing dizziness with impaired balance while walking at accustomed pace over approximately 12-15 minute time period.  I was compelled to leave the track and lay down on an exercise mat where fortunately my wife came by t Within half hour of this attack i coiuld not stand and walk independently without support. My first time to a hospital ER  in my 78 years of life. Recommended for observation and additional tests I stay overnight in observation unit. Diagnosis appeared to be perplexing for physicians.  My wife  came by to assist me in standing , walking to the car and driving me to nearby ER. What happened to me was a frightening, anxiety-producing and dangerous situation. I could have easily fallen with substantial head or other bodily injury. Being in excellent health and with nothing else unusual having occurred recently to affect my general health (no changes, no illnesses), I cannot help conclude this episode was a serious adverse reaction to my 2nd Moderna vaccination.  I now consider what happened on 3/28/21 a &#34;Vestibular Attack&#34;. I think possibly my body for some reason related to the vaccine might have been attacking itself, if that makes sense to scientists.  I hope this doesn&#39;t happen to others. I am not anti-vaccination. But individuals should be warned about this possible dangerous reaction or adverse side effect, which in my case did not occur immediately after the 2nd Moderna dose. I&#39;ve complained to the hospital that possibility of severe dizziness with extreme loss of balance being related to recent Moderna 2nd vaccination was NOT discussed or commented.

                                                7 hours after the vaccine tiredness and mild nausea started.  Approximately 26 hours after the vaccination extreme dizziness occurred and he lost consciousness for a few  seconds.  He was clay and completely lost his coloring . His son is a retired HCP and we took vitals and within 30 minutes after drinking electrolytes he was back to normal.  We believe he was dehyrated. He has had vertigo in the past and has a pacemaker.  His blood pressure was taken in 3 positions and within less than 30 minutes after having him hydrate all symptoms subsided.  I emailed these symptoms to his Medical Doctor.  We also had him use his pacemaker monitoring system to send a report to his healthcare specialist.

                                                Currently waiting for dental work (crown removal and replacement to treat cavity).    2/18/21 Started to experience toothache (R) which got worse as the day progressed.  Tylenol didn&#39;t help.  Took one tab of Percocet (5-325) to allow me to sleep.    2/19/21 Contacted dentist and was prescribed Penicillin VK 500 mg. Started Penicillin around 3 pm.   2/19/21 ~6 pm onset shakes, chills, sweating, low grade fever (~100.2), nausea, headache, weakness,  difficulty in standing.  Took more tylenol, lay down, fell asleep for approximately 3 hours. Woke briefly took my nighttime meds (atrovastatin, metoprolol, ranolazine, baby aspirin.) Additional information for Item 18:  2/20/21 Felt better when I woke up.  Temp normal. Ate breakfast.  Mild stomach ache. Around 3 pm onset of sweating and chills, shakes. Low grade temp (~100)   2/22/21 Fully recovered.  No lingering issues.  Not sure whether what I experienced is related to the Moderna vaccine or a reaction to the Percocet I took to alleviate the severe pain associated with my toothache.

He fell on the floor and was unable to get up.  His face was very flushed and he broke out in a sweat several times.  We had to have fire dept come and pick him up off the floor.  He was able to get around a little bit with a walker, but spent most of the day in bed and was transported to bathroom by wheelchair.  He was also a bit confused.  He had very little appetite and was unable to eat very much.  At dinner time, he ate a little bit of soup and when he stood up at the table, fell again onto wood floor.  We had to call fire dept to pick him up from floor and EMT&#39;s/ambulance to come out and check him over.  VItals were all normal.  He was just a little bit better on the next several days.

                                                By 3:00 he had a whole body chill.  He was then incoherent, lost all control of all body muscles and was incontinent both bladder and bowel.  He continued as such when Dr. said to give him Prednisone along with the Benadryl he was receiving every six hours starting at 3:30 p.m. 3/8/2021.  He was given a Prednisone at 4:00 p.m. 3/9/2021 and again at 8:00 p.m. on 3/9/2021 along with his Benadryl.  He was unable to ambulate or even turn his body over in bed.  He was able sip water and sports drink but ate nothing since noon on 3/8/2021.  It wasn&#39;t until early Sunday morning that he was able to move his legs and get to a walker and use the toilet.  He slow, very slowly has improved since then.  Late Sunday he was able to get up, and sit in a chair.  Later he was able to take a sit down shower and shampoo and   be an to feel &#34;nearly human&#34; again.  He has slowly progressed since then and Monday morning was able to navigate by himself and to descend and ascend a 13 stair step to the basement.    In discussing the 24 hours he spent in bed he was unaware of any of the things going  on such as not being able to move, but knew he was in pain if he moved his legs.  He also had a temperature of 102.3 which rose to 102.9 and then with cold compress on his forehead and time his fever dropped to 95.4 and the back up to a normal of 97.5.  These are similar symptoms he had after the first injection of the Covid 19 Moderna vaccine and he had had a similar reaction in 2017 from the first flu shot he ever had in his life.  He felt he needed to take this vaccine in order to be able to &#34;have a life&#34; even though we assumed he would have such a bad reaction.  He is slowly improving and if it is like the first injection it will take him nearly two weeks before he can ambulate at the level he was before the vaccination.  Still, he is grateful to Center for being so proactive as to have available the vaccine and it being more convenient for cancer patients than waiting in line at a mass inoculation center.   He would appreciate an acknowledgement that this information has been received and could possibly passed along to help others in his situation.  Thanks.

                                                He woke up the next day after the vaccine he did not know where he was and was confused.  He did not take his medications, did not remember to take it.  He came out to his wife and she heard some noise and he looked over to the dog dish to refill it and didn&#39;t refill it as he usually does.  Just a lot of forgetful things that he did.  He had dizziness and was hanging on the door frame and went to bed, and told his wife that he did not know anything and did not know what he was doing.  They took him to the doctor and was seen by the doctor who checked his VS and said that he was okay, and told them that he was having a reaction to the vaccine, and was starting to come around and remembering things while he was in the doctors office.  They were advised to take him home and let him rest, and he did and didn&#39;t eat until last evening.  He had the same reaction that he had when he had the COVID virus.  He knew everything this morning and back to his baseline.

                                                Patient is an 79 year old male who had his 2nd Moderna vaccination in his dominant right arm Thursday afternoon.  Upon awakening Friday morning, he had difficulty walking.  His legs were strong enough to hold him, but he was unstable.  He also had some numbness on the palmar surfaces of some index and middle fingers of his left hand.  His speech was somewhat garbled, but when his wife would encourage him to repeat himself, he could enunciate more clearly.  He had some nonspecific difficulty swallowing.  He attributed this all to adverse reaction to the vaccination, which would pass...  Friday mid day his wife took him to the barber, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  Later in the day on Friday they went for car ride, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  He had no other episodes of nausea.  He had no fevers or chills.  He had no visual disturbances.  He had no other numbness or paresthesias.  He was aware of no clear weakness.  Finally today, the gait instability persisted and the numbness in the left hand, so he came to the ER for evaluation.   Patient is currently recovering in the hospital

He was on the floor as he slid off the bed and could not push himself up on his arms, and got worse and worse.  He went up to bed, and his son had to come over and help him into bed as he was not even able to lift his legs to get into bed.   Then at 3:00 AM this morning he could start walking again.  Now this morning he is a little wobbly and otherwise getting better.  He did take 2 Tylenol.  No soreness around the injection site, just the extreme weakness.

Someone watched him, concerned, because he was walking very slowly (normally has a slow gait because of leg braces and toe amputations so I don&#39;t know if it was unusually slow).  The woman saw him fall and she ran to help-administered CPR immediately-and told me he died instantly. Medics tried to resuscitate and failed to bring a pulse.  (My husband left our home around 11:15 to drop a package off at store. The store is one mile from our home. At around 12:30 a deputy came to my door and when I saw him my knees buckled.  I knew something horrible happened.

He was taken by ambulance to the local hospital and treated with fluids I believe.  After regaining strength, he went home and was given meclizine for nausea and dizziness.  He was told to keep up fluids and rest.

                                                The following day I had soreness in my left shoulder. Then two days after that the 11th I had a really bad headache. The following day I started feeling like my equilibrium was out of balance. I can not even walk a straight line. The headache and soreness in my shoulder went away but I am still experiencing equilibrium issues.  This is making it hard for me to walk. It feels I have been on ship. I called in to my ARNP this morning; She and I are waiting on a return call from her.

                                                On 02/17/2021, patient received the second dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine in the left arm. Approximately 3 days post-administration, patient developed pain, swelling and erythema of the shoulder extending to the posterior/proximal anterior sections of the arm. Patient was unable to move arm due to swelling and presented to the Medical Center Emergency Department on 02/22/2021. A CT of the extremities revealed cellulitis, myositis, and possible fasciitis without abscesses. Subsequent MRI found myositis and cellulitis without evidence of osteomyelitis. Patient began to develop erthematous blotches and an Infectious disease consult was placed. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin). After cultures were obtained, patient was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. Two sets of blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics and a left arm swab showed no growth (finalized). On 02/26/2021 patient underwent incision and debridement of left arm with findings of edematous soft tissue without abscess or necrosis. On 02/28/2021 all antibiotics were discontinued per Infectious Disease provider due to lack of concern for infection.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included xylometazoline hydrochloride, simvastatin, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, metformin, lisinopril, propanol, hydrochlorothiazide and levothyroxine.  On 01 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: Unknown) intramuscularly on right upper arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 01 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: Unknown) intramuscularly on left upper arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 02 Mar 2021, the patient experienced arm pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, medically significant event of passing out on the driveway, could not get up and tremors in hand.  Treatment for the event included nausea medication.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, arm pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, passing out on the driveway, could not get up and tremors in hand was resolved on 06 Mar 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.  Fever, nausea and vomiting are consistent with the product safety profile.

Basic labs were unremarkable. COVID negative. CXR negative. He was given Tylenol for fever and admitted under observation. He remained afebrile and heart rate remained controlled with home Cardizem dosing. Cardiology was consulted who will refer him to their clinic to establish routine care with their service.

                                                Client is elderly and has reduced mobility status. Client was ushered up into the bleacher seating at the vaccination site following the dose administration, and upon sitting down was experiencing shortness of breath (reported by the client to be from walking up the stairs). Client pulled out personal inhaler (albuterol) and self-administered a dose. Responder noted pallor and increased difficulty with speaking for the client, but client&#39;s breathing returned to a regular rate and rhythm in the minutes following albuterol administration. Client&#39;s pallor resolved. The client refused emergency medical services twice, and refused having his vitals taken. The client was monitored visually by responder until deemed appropriate for discharge from the observation area. When the client ambulated down the stairs, Responder noted unsteadiness in gait. Once the client was safely at the bottom of the stairs, a wheelchair was retrieved for the client so that the client could safely exit the facility. Client accepted the wheelchair at this time. Client refused a vitals check a second time at the checkout station, per responder.

                                                3 days after getting first Moderna vaccine, he experienced dizziness and falling. He fell at least 3 or 4 times and is now using a walker to prevent falls. He had not used a walker before. He had not seen his doctor,but was encouraged to make an appointment to see if he has fluid in his ears, etc. He reports no nausea or broken bones. I will foolw-up with him at the end of this week to check progress. He states some improvement.

                                                Stroke.  I do not know if the vaccine was related or not, but the patient had a stroke and falls on 2/17/2021 and 2/18/2021 and was found to have two strokes.  He does have atrial fibrillation, but with the proximity to the second vaccine, I cannot tell if they are just related temporally or if there is a true risk.  Another patient at this facility had a stroke within same time frame post second Moderna vaccine, but not my patient, so I do not know if that was reported.  Due to new nature of this vaccine, I felt it important to report this event for further investigation.   Again, I am not sure if it is a true adverse reaction of the vaccine or not.

                                                Daughter calling to ask about side effects of COVID vaccine? She said her 83 yr old dad got the COVID- 19 yesterday and overnight he became confused, had severe weakness, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, and became feverish.  She said mom said they both got first dose of COVID vaccine yesterday around noon- then last night he started to feel unwell. Around 2am- her mom said her dad- became very weak, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, confused, started coughing, he had chills, felt feverish. She said so concerning by 4am her mom called EMS who came and took him to the Medical Center.   She said he had pretty severe case of COVID in December that he need hospitalized for-she said  he as really weak, foggy headed at that time, kind of out of his mind- she said was told that is how he was acting last night.   After being seen in ED and getting put on some fluids and then antibiotics he now seems to be acting more like himself. They hydrated- have some concerns about possible pneumonia dx so they started him on antibiotics- was told this might be due to his rxn post &#43; COVID vaccine - which is what prompted her to call today.   He is supposed to follow up with his PCP doctor.  He seemed better when he got home this morning- she said just left him a little bit ago after eating early lunch with him. She is not sure if getting him hydrated &amp; sent home with antibiotics is what helped or just time since now about 24 hours post vaccination dose.  Confirmed he has had no prior rxn to any other vaccines in the past.

                                                10 days after my shot both of my shoulders became extremely sore, I could not use my arms with out feeling extreme pain. After about four hours the  pain was reduced enough so that I could continue my daily routine , however the shoulder pain continues. About a week ago my hips began to hurt  when I walk sat and stood up. The pain in hips is about half of what is in shoulder.I have taken Ibuprofen and Extra Strength Tylenol but have no felt any relief.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 031620A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient experienced little bruising in the arm. On 12 Feb 2021, the patient was a bit off. On Sunday, 28 Feb 2021, in the evening, the patient got cold, and within minutes his entire whole body was in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe were in pain. It felt like it was invaded with COVID. He went to hospital and got tested for COVID, Strep throat and Flu, and all three test results were negative. On an unknown date, the patient experienced tightening in his throat muscle and he went to the hospital where he was admitted.  While there, they did every possible test, chest MRI, Neck MRI, all possible viral tests, and rapid and full COVID test.  The rapid and full COVID tests came back negative.  Results for chest MRI, neck MRI and viral tests were not provided.  The hospital also performed a blood culture for bacteria. Results were not provided.  The patient was unable to move much, his blood pressure and oxygen were a little unstable. On 06 Mar 2021, the hospital did a major blood test which came back negative and the patient was released from a hospital. He stated that he was still weak in terms of walking and coughing. He stated that he recently bled due to taking blood thinner.  Treatment included major antibiotic treatments and steroids for pain during the hospital stay. The patient was still taking prednisone at a tapering dose.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The events of weak in terms of walking, coughing were unresolved, while the outcome of the events of tightening in his throat muscle, unable to move much, unstable blood pressure, unstable oxygen, bled due to blood thinner, Bruising in arm, cold, entire body in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded.  Myalgia and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine

Every time I opened my eyes the area began spinning again.  I had a fever and sweated heavily for about 1 hour.  I took two aspirin with a glass of water.  I had a short nap, lying on the ground, when I woke up the fever was gone and I started having chills.  After about 30 min, my dizziness was less, but I still could not walk.  I started sitting up and scooting backward into the house, which took about 30 min to get into the house.   I  laid on the floor, was still having chills, so covered up with many blankets. About 8pm, 5 hours after first getting dizzy, the chills were gone and I was able to get up and get in bed.   About 10 pm I took 2 asprins and went to sleep.I had to get up

                                                Patient presents today with his wife and son. He was recently hospitalized having developed a fever the day after his Covid vaccine 1 with associated confusion and some ataxia. He was admitted to the hospital overnight where an MRI scan suggested no acute change showing only moderate cerebral atrophy and some small vessel occlusive changes. He tested positive for Covid by PCR in the emergency department on 1/22. His oxygen saturation was stable. He did have a fever and describes falling off the toilet because of some generalized leg weakness and uncoordination. He has had some chronic left greater than right upper extremity sensory loss following prior cervical spine stenosis requiring urgent surgery in 3/2019. He has had some chronic left foot drop as well. He reports being somewhat deconditioned having spent some time in bed to the above episode but is now ambulating with a cane at home and has occupational and physical therapy in place. He has been mildly dyspneic on exertion above baseline but attributes this to some deconditioning. He did have an episode of lower dental pain with ambulation in the office that was more than usual though denies associated chest pain or pressure and has had no jaw or shoulder pain with exertion. Review of systems is negative for headache.

                                                On Tuesday after receiving the vaccine Lowell fell out of bed and was unable to get up. I called 911 and the EMTs helped him up into his wheelchair. Since he has Parkinson&#39;s and has balance problems he is unable to stand on his own for very long. All day Tuesday he was incoherent and fell twice in the bathroom where on the floor he was incontinent of his bowels. Later in the day he was incontinent of urine while sitting in his chair and was unaware of it. Two days later he says he doesn&#39;t recall any of that but his cognition seems to be better now. I think this should be a warning for Parkinson&#39;s patients.

                                                I am a four-year resident of facility and have never experienced a serious illness or traumatic injury in all of my adult life (I turn 86 this year). So on January 23rd I received my initial shot of the Moderna vaccine, for which I experienced no reaction, whatsoever. One month later I returned to hospital for my Moderna Booster shot on Saturday, February 20. I felt a few chills that evening, with nothing to speak about, but awoke on Sunday morning feeling so ill that I could barely sit up in bed. I borrowed my wife?s walker and managed to make it to and from the bathroom, and got back to bed again, whereupon I called my son, an emergency-room physician, who told me to take two Advil tablets (or its equivalent), and welcomed me to the club. I stayed in bed through the rest of Sunday and continued to sleep and rest throughout Monday morning, only feeling well enough to get out of bed without assistance by noon on Monday, thereby missing the February meeting of the monthly meeting that had been scheduled for that morning (and for which I had regularly been a member of and had attended every meeting for over three years). My personal takeaway from all this was that ?the cure was worse than the disease.?

                                                Immediately after injection, I developed a headache and slight dizzyness.  I returned home in 45-60 minutes and found that I had a significant increase in my blood pressure.  Normally, 115 -120 mm Hg systolic and 75 - 80 mm Hg diastolic; when I returned home, my blood pressure was 150 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic.   The blood pressure has gradually returned to normal over 3 days.  Tachycardia has also been present (110 bpm), but has returned to normal of 70 - 75 bpm.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately 10 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 10:00 pm with severe left hip pain. His left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), and he took 2 ibuprofens then went to bed.   On 10 Jan 2021, he was still in pain with a low grade fever of 98.8 which is 1 to 2 degrees higher than normal for him. He reported using his wife&#39;s walker to ambulate and took 4 ibuprofens which helped his hip.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was still in pain, had a limp, and ran a low fever until the afternoon. Treatment for the events included ibuprofen.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the event, low grade fever, was considered resolved on 11 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), low grade fever and limp, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events of low grade fever, gait disturbance and severe left hip pain are temporally associated with the administration of mRNA-1273 and a causal association cannot be excluded. Fever and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the product.  The event of paralysis is considered unlikely pending additional information.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not included. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 27 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 06 Feb 2021, approximately 10 days after the patient received the vaccine, he experienced a fast heart rate, dizziness, cold body temperature, and atrial fibrillation. (The wife reports that they purchased an EKG machine, and this is what the machine showed them. Unaware if he had this before the vaccine or not.)  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was unknown.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cold body temperature, dizziness and atrial fibrillation, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the event occurred 9 days after vaccine administration and very limited information regarding this patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were event is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Further information has been requested.

                                                Weakness and some dizziness started about 1  1/2 hrs after shot was given.  It lasted the rest of the day the shot was given and continued on the next day, 01/12. The feeling was far from normal for me.  Better this AM, 13th.  Called Moderna on 1/12 and they said  this was not unusual.

                                                The day after vaccine 01/14/2021, he had no strength once so ever in his body. We had to have help from a man and a women to help get him on the toilet, off the toilet, to sit him up on the couch, getting in and out of bed. He could not function on his own. It effected him mentally. Right now he couldn&#39;t even that this happened. On the 15th he seemed normal. But now like a week later his memory and strength was bad. Today he is not that bad. It seems to be coming and going with the problem mentally. I took him to the doctor today.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  The patient received the first dose of  mRNA-1273 (lot number 029L201A) on 14 Jan 2021.   On 11 Feb 2021, the  patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 030M20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt unwell for a few days, and couldn&#39;t walk or talk.  On 16 Feb 2021, the patient was admitted to the ICU for 7 days. Then, moved to rehabilitation and remains there. Wife stated that she wants Moderna to reach out to them with regards to compensation or whatever can be done. She is OK for safety follow-up.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events. Therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome for the events of feeling unwell (malaise), couldn&#39;t walk (gait disturbance), and couldn&#39;t talk (speech disorder) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Further information has been requested.

Pt reports that he was outside loading a trailer when he suddenly felt lightheaded and like he was going to pass out. Pt also enorses nausea, denies vision changes. Pt lowered himself to the ground and called his son to help him and take him to the hospital to be assessed. Pt reports that he frequently has episodes of lightheadedness in the mornings for the past 5 years, but they have been increasing in frequency and this episode was the worst he has ever had. On arrival to the ED he continues to have generalized weakness and is unable to sit up and feels unsteady on his feet.

He has begun to have mild memory changes after suspected COVID illness (covid testing negative) in November, but daughter of patient, with whom he lives, states that his memory and orientation now significantly changed- he seems to have forgotten the last &#34;3 years&#34; of memory.  Presented to ER 1/16/21 as she checked his O2 and found him to be hypoxic in 60s. He is being treated for possible CAP with underlying perviously undiagnosed ILD vs post-covid lung changes (per pulmonology), and his energy and ability to walk have returned but memory is significantly impaired, confabulating and oriented only to self despite good oxygenation on 5L O2 by NC.

Comes to the emergency department today after getting his 1st Monday and a COVID-19 vaccine at 7:30 p.m. and about 5 minutes after while sitting down developing significant diaphoresis, nausea, dizziness and feeling very warm.  The symptoms lasted for about 15 minutes and then resolved.  Since then the patient has felt a little off in his stomach but has not had any difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, chest pain, diarrhea, rash or itchiness.  With this episode the patient did not have any changes to his vision or feel like he was going to pass out.  Patient will be given 25 of Benadryl, 125 of Solu-Medrol, 20 of famotidine of concern for possible allergic reaction.  Additionally the patient will be given a small bolus of normal saline.  Given the patient&#39;s reassuring vitals and reassuring physical exam he will simply be monitored here were sure.  I do not feel any lab workup is necessary this point this is resolved episode seems either like a mild allergic reaction or a vasovagal episode.

Within a few hours, my left hand began to tingle and my right leg felt stiff. I experienced a loss of balance that made walking difficult.  For the next 24 hours I became very fatigued. But two days after the vaccination, I have begun to regain my strength.

                                                I did have and still have soreness of shoulder where I got the injection. That I can expect to stay. When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.

                                                I received a Moderna vaccine injection on January 19, 2021 at approximately 3:15 p.m.  Later that evening at about 7:40 p.m, I was suddenly hit with pain in my back like someone had hit me with a board.  The pain continued to surround the midsection in a swath of about 15 inches.  I felt like my muscles were failing me.  I made it to my bed where I started shivering and shaking uncontrollably feeling like I was having a seizure.  The shaking was sporadic, lasting about an hour. I was covered with a blanket and continued with liquids for dehydration and was given an Xanax to calm nerves. Later that night while attempting to sleep, I was perspiring and my heart was beating 90 to 100 beats hindering sleep.  Through the night I attempted to go to the bathroom but with absolutely no control over my arms and legs I was unable to stand.  Rolling off the bed and unable to pull myself back, I lay on the floor and pulled a cover over me.   At about 4:30 a.m. (Wednesday morning.) I was covered with another blanket and a pillow was put under my head.  I slept until awakened at about 11 a.m  My heart rate and oxygen level was chedked and appeared to be within normal range.  I was greatly fatigued, and light-headed. Continuing a regimen of liquids, I was fed a small amount of soup and some fruit. I ate nothing the rest of the day. I slept most of the day.  In the evening, I was fatigued and nauseated and spent 2-3 hours through the night on my knees in the bathroom attempting to vomit.   Thursday morning I was awakened around 11.a.m. and was barely able to lift my head.  I slept more until needing to use the bathroom and receiving more liquids. Two hours later I was able to eat only a half a piece of toast ? the first and only thing I was able to eat that day.  Early evening having no control of  my legs, I attempted to walk. It was difficult getting legs out of the covers, but I got up and walked a few feet with the help of a walker. However, an hour later (about 8:30) I went to the bathroom and was unable to pull myself up from the toilet and fell to the floor and crawl flat on my stomach to my bed.  I had no strength in my legs and arms and needed assistance from two people to put me on my bed. Periodic rapid heartbeat and fatigue caused restless sleep. Some strength began to return on Friday and with caution over the weekend, and support from a loving family, I appear to be making a slow recovery.  Checking with several family medical people working in hospitals, my experience with the serum seemed more extreme than most.  Therefore, it was felt that I should report some information on how the Moderna injection affected me that it may be of help to others. (Some of the above information was related to me as I was not always cognizant of conditions at particular times.) I am still puzzled, as members of my family are, as to what happened to me.  We would be grateful for any information that might be helpful for us to understand my situation as it relates to others that may have had similar experiences with the Moderna serum.
