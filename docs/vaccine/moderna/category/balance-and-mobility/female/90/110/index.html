She was admitted to the hospital - Initial NIHSS was 26 and CT imaging showed no acute hemorrhage but mild hypodensity of greater than 1/3 of the MCA territory (TPA not recommended).  CTA did show distal L M1/M2 occulsion and she was transferred to larger facility for thrombectomy.  Unfortunately the patient had persistent severe neurological deficits after thrombectomy.  Was discharged home on hospice care and expired on 1/23/21.

Client reported she had to use the restroom, upon standing client, LPN noticed blood on client&#39;s pillow. After assisting with ambulation to her bathroom, LPN noticed blood covering the floor near her shower. After further assessment, blood appeared to me coming from the back of client&#39;s head. Vital signs assessed while she sits on the toilet.  BP: 128/92 O2: 89% on RA RR: 18 HR: 69 T: 99.1 Client reported significant dizziness, lightheadedness, and nausea. She reported unsteadiness when standing. Quarter sized lump with dried blood noted on the back of client&#39;s head. She does report left arm soreness, likely from where vaccine was administered. Ambulance was contacted while LPN assisted dressing client. Client was unable to recall the incident that occurred overnight, she did not utilize her call pendant during initial fall. Time of fall/incident unknown.

On 8:10am Sunday, heart beat ranged from 50 to 125 bpm, blood pressure dropped to 90/64. Doctor took me off all meds except Xarelto, said stay in bed, drink lots of fluids. I did not connect the symtoms to the vaccine at the time because problems happened after the 1st few hours, and I was too sick to think clearly. It was only when I read the side effects after 1-3 days, that I realized it could be from the vaccine. I worry about being deathly sick after the second vaccine shot, so I&#39;m reporting this.

                                                TIA diagnosis at hospital; Conscious after fall; Dizzy/ lightheadedness; Head bump (temple area and ear caused by hit sink during fall); A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 90-years-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced transient ischemic attack, fall, dizzy lightheadedness, and a head bump.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included transient ischemic attack; the patient experienced 3 events in 2020.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 030L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient experienced dizzy lightheadedness and a fall, resulting in a head bump in her temple and ear caused by hitting the sink as she fell. The patient was hospitalized following the fall and diagnosed with transient ischemic attack.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient received magnetic resonance imaging and a laboratory test.  On 27 Jan 2021, the lightheadedness and head bump had resolved.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not reported.   The outcome of the events, transient ischemic attack and fall, was considered resolved on 25 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, lightheadedness and head bump, was considered resolved on 27 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 90-years-old female patient with a relevant medical history of three TIA within last year, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Dizziness and Transient ischaemic attack and non-serious unexpected events of Fall and Head injury.  The events of occurred approximately 2 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 030L20A. Treatment details were not provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of TIA are considered significant confounders.

Patient&#39;s son tried to call her around 3:30 or 4 and there was no answer. Son called the facility where patient resided and staff went to check on her, where they found patient on the floor, conscious. Patient was communicating fine when they found her. It is unclear if she bumped her head when she fell, but patient deteriorated and was taken to ER where a CT was done and it was determined patient had a brain bleed as well as a UTI.

She states that any time she takes a step down (not up), she feels very dizzy.  She has started using a cane because of this which she is dissatisfied with.  This started after she got the second dose on the 10th of March, and has been continual for her since then.  She is not our patient and we do not have any real information about her except that she received both of her doses from the Health Department.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (left-arm), my mother began to have moderate pain in her left arm, particularly in the left shoulder area. The pain continued to increase throughout the afternoon, until it became so severe (10 on a 10-point pain scale) by 8:30 pm on 3/10/21 , that she could no longer lift her arm. She took 500 mg of Tylenol to attempt to relive the pain and went to bed early.   At 2:45 am on 3/11/21, she needed to go to the restroom, and I (daughter) had to assist her to get out of bed, as she had no use of her left arm due to severe pain in that arm. While seated on the toilet, she indicated that her arm was extremely painful and she felt that she was going to pass out and felt nauseated. Within a minute, she lost consciousness and  I called emergency services. EMT arrived within 5 minutes and stated that her blood pressure was extremely low and she needed to be placed on the floor.  They placed her on a gurney and took her to the ambulance, where they started an IV and took her to her local hospital.  I followed shortly thereafter, where she was taken to the ER. She was admitted to the hospital for observation and given Ativan (she refused any opioids) She was ultimately diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the pain in her left arm. Two days later, the pain has subsided.

                                                Mom has mild cognitive impairment.  She is well above average for a 93 year old. I live with her and she is highly functioning.    The day of her vaccine, she seemed very tired. The next day, she was exhausted. She had a hard time doing her normal activities. No fever. It was much more challenging for her to walk. She just couldn&#39;t get moving. It seemed to stay the same. I noticed she was having a harder time doing everything. Suddenly, her comprehension seemed to change. Within a week, she went from mild cognitive deficits to full blown cognitive impairment: not knowing how to take her pills, how to wash hands, how to use her watch/fitness tracker, to not removing her bottle cap to drink water, to having a hard time communicating. I called the Pharmacist where she had the vaccine, and they told me that this was not uncommon after the vaccine. They had been getting lots of similar calls. They haven&#39;t given out any second shots yet, and were not looking forward to it after everything they&#39;ve been hearing.  This is very frightening.!!!! Our Mom cannot be left alone now.  How long will this last????!!!!

                                                My mother fainted on the night she was vaccinated, early in the morning. She had gone to the kitchen to get a heating pad and felt faint while standing  She didn&#39;t make it to a chair, but fell and broke her hip.   While this could have been due to another health problem, my mother had never had a fall or a near-fall. it is concerning that very old adults are not warned to have someone with them after receiving the vaccine (for instance, overnight),  I realize that the vaccine has not been studied specifically in geriatric populations, but it is realistic to assume that there are substantial numbers of very old people living on their own, particularly in cities where there is no need to drive, and where food and other necessities can be delivered. There should be a warning to people that they should not be alone after receiving the vaccine.
