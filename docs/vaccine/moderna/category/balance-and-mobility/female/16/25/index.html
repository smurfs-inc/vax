                                                Approximately 7-8 minutes after receiving the vaccine, started to feel light-headed, thought she was going to pass out, and her heart was racing extremely high. The health care team at the site took her blood pressure, measured heart rate, gave her water, juice and chocolate and tried to get her heart rate to drop. It was fluctuating up and down and she couldn&#39;t stand up without dizziness;  we waited 45 minutes and then drove her home as she was unable to drive her own car.  She was experiencing significant lightheadedness, and consistent heart racing even while lying down on the sofa/bed. This continued for several days and she stayed home from school and sports. We called her primary care doctor on the 10th and they suggested she wait another day to see how she was feeling. She started to feel a bit better by Friday, was still experiencing a bit of the tiredness, nauseous, light-headed and heart spikes, but was able to drive, move around.  On Sunday evening, she started to experience increased heart rate again, lymph nodes were very painful and started experiencing the light headedness all evening.  On Monday we took her to her primary care provider and they then referred her to ER for the heart racing and a EKG. The increased light headedness, feeling like she will pass out even while laying in bed, dizziness has all increased and her lymph nodes continue to be swollen and painful. It has been over a week since the vaccine and there is no clear sign of her reaction getting any better, if not worse.  The EKG results indicated a new abnormality and we are trying to get her to a cardiologist.  She is and had been a very healthy, varsity athlete that runs over 30 hours a week with track, and since receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine is unable to move very far within the house without feeling that she is going to pass out or that her heart rate is shooting up uncontrollably.

Pharmacy staff placed the patient lying down on the floor, gave her a cool wet cloth and monitored her for worsening symptoms. Patient immediately began to feel better, less nauseated and cooling down. Attempted to follow up with patient later in the day, but she did not answer call.

                                                Initially she passed out following the vaccine - within 90 seconds- she has a history of passing out with injections and blood draws. Around noon she had a seizure. She describes a feeling of darkness and dread closing in on her and she was unable to speak or move. She was on the stairs at the time. I witnessed her stiffen, then go limp and fall between the electric stair hair and the wall. She hit the hardwood floor face first then she began to shake/twitch. She was unconscious. She awoke screaming, incoherent speech, and flailing limbs. It took about 5 minutes to calm her and be able to understand her speech. She only remembers the darkness and waking up scared and feeling awful. She was put supine on the floor with feet elevated, blood pressure monitored, given juice to drink, and vitals checked routinely. After about an hour supine and conscious, she felt good enough to sit up. She sat up for 15 minutes before she was able to stand with assistance. Family physician was notified immediately and we are still waiting for a response. She has a goose egg sized knot on her forehead, a bruise on the side of her face and a black eye from hitting the floor. She has a huge bruise on her outer thigh and lower leg where she hit the stair chair and then seized and it it repeatedly on the metal. She has underarm pain from where her armpit hit the edge of the stairs when she fell and seized. She has no history of any types of seizures.

I passed out briefly around 12 hours after the vaccine, and I&#39;m not sure how long I remained unconscious. Through all of this, my left arm was difficult to move or use, I felt hot suddenly and then cold, and I was tired. The next day, the most serious side effects were gone, but I remained feverish, tired, and largely unable to move my left arm. Those side effects were gone on the third day and now I&#39;m better.

Unusual issues: The day after receiving the vaccine she had several hand tremors,  and feeling as if she had several &#34;mini seizures&#34; throughout the day, a few longer staring spells, some twitches.  She felt &#34;out-of it&#34; all day.   She has petite mal seizures and a history of interictal epileptiforn discharges.  Also history of an intention tremor in her hands. (The mild tremors were primarily in her right hand, to a lesser extent the left).   Today, 2 days afterwards, today, so far, she feels better.   Yesterday was terrible, but we waited it out assuming it was injection related.

                                                The 12:20 pm appointment today (4/20/21) had an adverse reaction to the IMZ. Patient was done receiving the vaccine at about 12:30 pm and I stated she would have to wait until 12:45 pm. Around 12:38 pm I noticed she looked a little pale and went to her side to check on her. The patient stated she was feeling light-headed, dizzy, nauseous, and had trouble with her vision. I had the patient lay down and elevate her feet. The technician also grabbed an ice pack to place behind her neck. Asked if she would like water. The patient then stated she was having trouble breathing/short of breath and her ears were ringing. Once the patient stated issues with breathing 911 was called. A code white had been called and management was in the pharmacy. The 911 operator continued to ask questions about the patient&#39;s status and stated to not give any water or medications. I continued to assess the patient&#39;s symptoms. Her vision improved; however, she continued to feel light-headed, nauseous, and having trouble breathing. A member of EMS was in the store and came over to assess the patient. He had the patient sit up but she continued to have the same symptoms. He assessed her IMZ site. She was not feeling itchy and had not developed any hives. The ambulance arrived. EMS evaluated the patient and then took her out of the store on the stretcher.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported.).    On 09-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 09-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS POSTURAL (patient cannot walk with out dizziness) (seriousness criterion disability), DIZZINESS (Dizziness with room spinning) and BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Unstable blood pressure). On 13-Feb-2021, the patient experienced LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes). On an unknown date, the patient experienced GAIT INABILITY (Cannot even walk around normally). At the time of the report, DIZZINESS POSTURAL (patient cannot walk with out dizziness), DIZZINESS (Dizziness with room spinning), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Unstable blood pressure), GAIT INABILITY (Cannot even walk around normally) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 09-Feb-2021, Heart rate: increased (High) increased.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       Relevant Text: The Patient&#39;s mother reported that the patient received their first dose on 9 Feb 2021 and approximately 10 minutes post receiving the vaccine the patient developed severe dizziness and had an increase in their heart rate. The patient also had an unstable blood pressure.  Few days later, the patient developed swelling in their lymph nodes. The reporter reported that the symptoms were still ongoing and now the patient cannot even walk without dizziness.

She left again after several minutes then came back around 5:20 saying she felt like she was going to pass out.  I told her to sit in our waiting room.  She said she felt faint and had tightness in her chest. I called the paramedics who arrived shortly after.  They said she had anxiety.  She was anxious before and after receiving the vaccine.  She left on her own.

                                                Patient had felt nervous prior to getting her 2nd shot. I asked if she had every had any serious reactions from previous medicines or vaccines, she stated &#34;no&#34;. I then asked how she did after her first shot and she said ok. While waiting her 15 min in the observation area she alerted us that she was feeling extremely hot. We brought her back into the IMZ booth and had her sit in the chair and turned a fan in her direction. I sat down with her an asked her questions and kept her talking to try to calm her down. She stated that she felt as if the chair was swaying a little. We laid out a yoga mat on the floor in the booth, had her lay down and elevate her feet in a chair. She began to get upset and I asked if she had anyone with her, she was able to open her phone and gave me permission to call her family member. Family member came in the store and was able to help calm her down. We gave her some water and had her rest. I monitored her pulse and face/lip color. She became a little flushed. She was able to leave on her own accord, I did walk out with her to ensure she made it safely. I called 2 hours later to check on her and she stated she was feeling better, less dizzy, but just a little tired.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient reported feeling lightheaded. Patient reported no vision changes, no problems breathing or talking. She said she does not like needles and that could have been the issue. I asked her to remain seated in observation and got her a cup of water. She drank with no problems swallowing. Reported no other symptoms. After approximately 5 minutes patient reported feeling about the same. After an additional approximate 5 minutes patient reported feeling much better. She remained in observation for approximately 5 more minutes, totaling approximately 30 minutes and reported feeling good. I offered for her to remain in observation as she felt comfortable but at that point she said she felt good and would call the pharmacy with any questions or concerns.

She reports she had pain in her teeth and her chest felt tight. She just didn&#39;t feel well. Closer to incident student felt dizzy, like she was &#34;going to pass out&#34;.  States she turned to someone to tell that person she was not feeling well &#34;but I couldn&#39;t talk; the words would not come out&#34;. She felt herself sway and then knew she fell to the floor. She felt like she was lying still for a bit but she could hear people around her and she heard someone say &#34;somebody start timing this&#34; (as if they knew it was a seizure).

Immunizer then turned around to give her brother vaccination. When he was turned around, he heard the patient&#39;s phone that she was holding dropped and that she had jerked her arm, which caused her phone to drop. When I went to the patient, she was crying and hyperventilating. I told her to put her head down and take deep breaths. I checked on pt in 15 min, was doing better but had burning sensation at injection site. Kept pt at pharmacy for 30 minutes.

I had her sit in head down position for several minutes and started to monitor her vitals. Prior to vaccine pt was having severe anxiety and has a history of syncope with blood drawns. After several mins of her sitting with ehr head down I checked her blood pressure and it was elevated 155/109 mmHg. 10 minutes later pt felt a little better but started to feel faint and dizzy again. I called emergency sevices and EMS arrived at the scene, assessed the patient and diagnosed her with anxiety/syncope. She opted out from going to the hospital with them. She left the store at 1:01 pm and felt alot better and stated she had an appt with her PCP at 3pm to further seek medical treatment if deemed necessary

                                                8 days after injection I had a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (?covid vaccine arm?), symptoms included firmness and a red patch on my upper arm near the injection site. The following morning, I woke up feeling well with the rash still on my arm (no change). 2 hours later I began feeling dizzy and fainted. I was unconscious for 5 to 10 seconds. When I woke up, the rash had vanished and the firmness was gone. No signs of the reaction were present after waking.

I went to check on her and offered her a cold compress for the back of her neck to help her cool down.  After another 5 minutes I went to check on her and the patients mother said she still did not feel good and she would like to have her checked out.  I explained that what she was experience were normal side effects of the vaccine, and she still wanted me to call EMS.  I called 911 and spoke to the dispatcher about her symptoms.  EMS came and checked her blood sugar, and blood pressure which were fine.  They instructed her to rest and explained those were normal symptoms.  She was able to leave about another 10 minutes of resting.

Needed assistance to stand and could not hold a pencil to write. Also numbness and tingling in hands and fingers. Face slightly swollen and red.  400 mg Ibuprofen was administered at  1530. Pushed fluids as soon as fever began. Cooling measures provided, cool shower, cold compress, change of clothes to light pajamas.  We contacted our Insurance 24 hour Nurse line at approximately 2100 when symptoms peaked. The RN on staff instructed us to seek immediate medical care.  We attempted to find an open Urgent Care unsuccessfully and tried to go to an ER but they were full. Fever began to come down around 2230, so we returned home. Continued with ibuprofen every six hours and cooling measures.

I returned to work afterwards, and later that evening I started to feel chills, but it wasn&#39;t severe to the point where I went home. When I returned home from work, the chills remained but I also felt extremely exhausted which was unusual for me. I also had a bit of a headache/felt lightheaded. I took Tylenol which somewhat helped the symptoms. I felt fine after going to bed.

When RN and I reached patient she was very weak, she was sitting in a chair. I instructed her colleauges to call 911 immediately. Patient was having a little trouble breathing. I think she was scared. I gave her 10 mlL of benedryl and RN administered a 0.5 mL dose of epinephine in her left arm. Patient was helped to the  floor and her feet were elevated.  RN put on a blood pressure cuff. Before she could get a reading, the paramedics were there and took over. Patient was transported to Hospital.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

Patient presents on 1/27/2021 after onset of pain, decreased ROM ongoing since administration.  I was able to visualize ecchymotic area where vaccine was administered and patient has photo evidence.  The physician responsible for the vaccine administration needs to be retrained on where to give deltoid muscle IM injections and to avoid the extremities where recent surgeries occurred (patient had right shoulder labrum repair in October 2020)

She cam back in side the room and we had a nurse assess her, her BP and heart rate were a  little elevated. We gave her some water and had her sit for some extra time while we talked to her. She has a child hood trauma regarding vaccine and had just had a major panic attack before and during her vaccination. We were all  pretty sure she had just worked her self up and was not feeling well because of that and she said as much herself. After about 15-20 more minutes her BP and heart rate were back to normal and although still feeling a little weak she was ready to go home with her mother.

                                                I got my shot, sat down, and was reading through the information that the clinic provided me. A few minutes after, I noticed my right arm was getting warm, but I thought I was being paranoid (placebo effect). I began to feel nauseated. About another 5 minutes after feeling warm and nauseous, my ears began to ring and my vision went white. I was cold but sweating. I have passed out a handful of times before for various reasons, so I knew what was happening. I tried to signal to a volunteer from my seat that I needed help, but I ended up laying on the ground by my chair before someone came over. Once I laid down, the attention of the volunteers and nurses was on me. Three came over to assist me. They held my legs up,  kept a hand on my wrist for a pulse, and fetched water. I talked myself through the dizziness and ringing in my ears. They put a cold rag on my forehead and had smelling salts on hand. Once I began to feel better, they helped me slowly sit up, and eventually helped me stand up and get into a chair. They kept a close eye on me for the next 30 minutes to make sure I didn?t have any other reactions.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID 19 Moderna vaccine on Tuesday morning. By Tuesday night I started to have virtually every side effect that Moderna listed including; fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, and extreme fever. The next morning as I woke up in attempt tp get ready for work, I was not feeling any better and began to feel light headed, and felt the need to vomit. As I had the feeling of needing to vomit, I turned to do so and fainted. From accounts by my family, I was told I woke up, and quickly passed out a second time. As I was awoken, there was probably a minute before I fainted for a third time. All three times I was told I lost consciousness. I was awoken and by that point my family had contacted emergency responders. Paramedics arrived and took all necessary vitals. I did not pass out after that third time. As I expected all side effects Moderna listed, I did not expect to feel as bad as I did and I thought it was worth reporting what happened to be the next day. It caused a panic and I was scared and nervous as I was unsure why that was happening. I&#39;ve tried to look up articles and links between passing out and the vaccine and all I can find is people fainting as they get the vaccine (which is common for any shot) but nothing for fainting that long after the vaccine was administered. I just wanted to report my incident.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

                                                My fever was through the roof. My body ached so bad I couldn?t walk. I was on fire all over. Then came the adverse event- uncontrollable shaking. This was not a side effect written on the moderna sheet of risks. I was shaking so bad I thought I may have a seizure. I finally settled down and fell asleep. About an hour later, I woke up shaking out of control. I was going to call 911 but my partner was able to grab some NyQuil for me and knocked me out. It was the most terrifying experience of my life and I will not be getting the second shot because of it.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

States 1 hour after the first dose (administered on  12/28/20) she was at work and her blood pressure dropped, she became dizzy and her face went white. She said her mother insisted she go to the ER to be examined. She states upon examination she was given fluids and tests were ran and the ER staff said she was fine. Explained this to physician at vaccine site and she said it was not a contraindication to receive 2nd dose and it sounds like possible vasovagal reaction or hypoglycemia. Patient states she still wanted to receive vaccine.  Was instructed to monitor patient for 30 minutes after vaccination,  assist patient in ambulation to waiting area to lower fall risk and provided patient with apple juice and trail mix in case of possible hypoglycemia.  About 5-10 minutes after vaccine, patient stated she became dizzy and was dry heaving. She was assisted to supine position; vitals were taken and blood pressure was slightly elevated. 911 was called. Before arrival of EMS, patient stated she was feeling better and vital signs stable. Patient was helped to ambulate around waiting area and upon arrival of EMS, patient states she did not need to be transported. Patient was observed for about 20-25 more minutes and she was fully recovered. Spoke with Dr who was on scene after the incident and she believes it was anxiety.

The symptoms started a few hours after I received the vaccine and got significantly worse the next morning. I had to call out of work because I physically felt that my knees would give out when I was standing. I also could not rest my wrists on anything because it caused too much pain. The next day, I felt much better and was able to go to work.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I became extremely dizzy, nauseous, my lips went numb, shortness of breath, weakness, slow reaction times, the inability to operate at my normal speed in thought and action, and I became very lethargic.  I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

                                                I got up to use the bathroom at 4:30 this morning. I was extremely shaky but made it. I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

She was breathing rapidly. She whispered that she was scared. I told her to take deep breaths to try and calm her. I asked if she felt hurt or if she has any trouble breathing. After about 3-5 minutes of lying on their ground, she became more alert and asked me if she fell from her chair. She didn&#39;t recall falling or that she said she was scared. I had her sit up and asked how she felt and if she had any symptoms of an allergic reaction--she said no. after another minute or 2, she was able to stand up on her own with no lightheadedness nor dizziness. I walked alongside her to another seat and she sat for another 25 to 30 minutes--she said she was completely fine before leaving with her sister

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

On day 2 felt feverish with sore arm and then on the 3rd day developed the same symptoms as the first day and went to the ED after taking benadryl x2 with no improvement in her symptoms.   Objectively there is no wheezing, swelling, or rash but the provider does note that there were 3 small excoriated spots on her wrist one of which looked like a hive.  The treatment of the reaction was:   o Antihistamines: benadryl 50mg at home and ibuprofen  o Steroids: IV solumedrol  o Epinephrine: x1   o ED admission

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/10/21 and had a large, red, inflamed area on her arm at the injection site for a few days, but otherwise tolerated vaccine well. She received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/10/21 and the next day (3/11/21) developed fatigue and lightheadedness while exercising, which continued for the next few days. She developed acute onset, sharp chest pain on 3/13/21 AM which did not resolve so she presented to an ED. Vitals were normal but labs notable for troponin I which peaked at 4.36, CK 758, d-dimer 640. CBC/CMP and EKG were unremarkable and initial TTE with EF ~45%. Repeat TTE obtained a few days later with normal LV and RV size/function without any wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac MRI obtained with normal LV function (EF 64%) but late gadolinium enhancement in a subepicardial distribution within the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle at the base most compatible with myocarditis. ESR and CRP were normal. Further workup to determine etiology of myocarditis was negative (ANA, ANCA, RF, hepatitis panel, HIV, full respiratory viral panel, COVID-19 PCR). She was placed on metoprolol succinate 12.5mg XL daily and will follow up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. Family concerned that COVID-19 vaccine was the trigger/underlying etiology of her myocarditis.

Onset was over the course of about 1 hour. I had previously taken part in the double-blinded Astrazeneca in COVID-19 trials (meaning I did not know I was vaccinated) in November 2019, so the nurse told me that the response could really be from anything: partly due to some interaction between the vaccines, allergy, and/or already producing antibodies. I was unblinded and told I was given the Astrazeneca vaccine. Interestingly, I had none of these responses to just the Astrazeneca vaccines, just a bit of soreness after the first one. I have never had such a strong response, and I believe this is the highest my temperature has ever been, and my lymph nodes are still swollen. I am much better now; however, even last night and this morning, I was feeling unwell.

                                                10 minutes after the vaccine administration I started to feel lightheaded with blurry vision, shortness of breath, and bounding pulse. I self recovered after about 5-10 min. About 20-30 minutes after that my legs started feeling tingling like they were going numb and I was experiencing hot flashes. This self recovered after 5 min. I was admitted to the ER and monitored for another hour but was stable.

Some heaviness in her chest  which progressed over next 10 minutes to feeling difficulty breathing - &#34;like a rock on her chest&#34; . At 09:04 AM She used her Albuterol asthma inhaler to see if it would help her breathing. No improvement in breathing, then complained at 0911 of some vision changes, felt like she was having to concentrate to breath - like breathing through a straw and at this time I started to hear her audibly wheezing - Squad was called. When they arrived around 9:18 AM she was having heaviness, closed her eyes - complaining of a little bit light headed, still having difficulty breathing.  She left with squad at 9:24 AM

This continued but then completely stopped 2 hours later, weirdly it returned exactly 24 hours later only not as extreme. I feel fine now but I also felt the need to call 911 during this episode.

                                                1/14/21- 10:30am Noticed some fullness/swelling in throat. Was still able to breath fine, but definitely noticed a difference. This lasted a few hours.  1/15/21- 3:45am I got up to use bathroom and noticed I was very lightheaded. I thought maybe I just stood up too fast. I got back in bed and my arm was 8/10 pain so I also thought faintness could possibly due to pain.  7:15am I got up to go to work and quickly felt very warm and my vision started to go black. I laid back down for a few minutes until this resolved. I took my temperature and it was 99.0. I got up again and started to get ready but began feeling light headed again. I ended up getting ready while sitting down because I kept feeling too much like I was going to pass out. I ate breakfast and felt fine. 8:00am I left for work and after driving for about 5 minutes I felt myself getting very warm again and light-headed. I ended up pulling over and calling for someone to come pick me up.  9:00am My temperature was 99.5. My blood pressure laying down was 110/74 and HR was 74. After standing for 5 minutes my BP was 90/70 and my HR was 92. During this 5 minutes of standing I felt myself getting warm again but my vision did not start to go black and I was able to stand for the full 5 minutes.  At various times throughout the day I would feel faint if I was standing or sitting upright for too long. The last time I felt this was was probably 11:30pm on 1/15/21. 1/16/21 - No light-headedness or warmth. Did feel some slight chest pressure, but nothing crazy and it only lasted maybe half of the day.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

At 9:30 the next morning, I developed a fever of 100.5 and body aches. Around 2 pm, I got a headache which felt like it was because blood was hitting the veins in my head really hard- I think that&#39;s high blood pressure? My blood pressure was 126/85. I read not to take medicine because it would make the vaccine less effective, but I had to take an aspirin at 8 pm because I couldn&#39;t handle the headache any more, and ever since, I&#39;ve just had a sore arm and a headache when I walk too fast (it&#39;s been two days after the shot now).

Left after sitting for 20 minutes because I thought the &#34;anxiety&#34; would resolve best at home. Arrived home at 10:25 AM. My lips started itching, and then swelled along with my tongue. My throat felt tight and I tried to take an oral Benadryl. It got stuck in my throat and I was unable to swallow the pill. It was also difficult to swallow water. I arrived at the ED by 10:40 AM, where I was treated with IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol. I remained swollen all over, especially in my fingers, for the next 4 days. I gained 12 pounds, either from the reaction or the steroids. My airway did not fully close.

She collapsed and had a 60second seizure followed by 4 minutes of post ictal activity. She did not vocalize answers during the time but nodded yes when asked if she had a seizure disorder. Patient had another 60 second seizure and then EMS arrived. Her seizure was generalized twitching and patient was unconscious. Vitals remained stable.

Some mild nausea/loss of appetite. From the beginning of my symptoms to the end of them, my best estimate is about 36 hours. Taking an aspirin alleviated most of the symptoms to where I was more functional. I did call into work and skip a meeting the day after.

I developed hives on my forehead, cheeks, neck, chest, and arms. The fingers on both my hands and my lips were tingling.  Treatment: I was rushed to the ER and given an IV steroid, IV fluids (2 bags), and IV benadryl.   Outcome: All the reactions went away within 4 hours and I was discharged from the ER. I was advised to take benadryl for 48 hours afterwards as needed and given a 5 day course of prednisone; 2 tablets taken daily.

He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

That went away so I thought that it was fine, however, two days ago I looked in the mirror and I had a large red circle around the injection site. It is itchy, red, swollen, and sore. It has been over a week since I received the vaccine so I was a bit worried about it.

Symptoms would come and go throughout day, but were worse in the mornings. Wednesday (2/10) - Present (2/13) - same symptoms as Tuesday (2/9). Symptoms worse in the mornings and after physical exertion (going to school, walking stairs), and at night as well. Symptoms are not severe, but I am concerned that they have lasted a full week. I have been taking Day-Quil severe every 4 hours. I was also on my period, which just ended yesterday (2/12). I believe my period started the day of the vaccine.  I plan on going to a doctor&#39;s office, but have been too tired to move from my apartment.

                                                The vaccine was administered to the patient in the consultation room. Once we left the consultation room, after about 2 minutes, the patient got my attention and complained of feeling dizzy. I went to her side, and she told me that she felt like she was going to pass out. The patient then proceeded to lose consciousness while sitting in a chair in the waiting area. She then exhibited seizure-like movements (muscles contracted, groaning sounds) for about 10 seconds, and she then regained consciousness. I administered no treatment, since this did not exhibit the signs of an anaphylactic reaction. 911 was called, and emergency medical services arrived. The patient was then taken to the hospital. The patient stated that she has had a similar reaction in the past to getting a vaccine, she thinks it is from the stress of getting injected with a needle.

Headache, fatigue, dizziness, random spurts of sweating, and not wanting to eat anything. All started day after vaccine. I have taken Benadryl that helped significantly started taking on Friday(3/12/21). Lymph nodes are still swelling and injection area is starting to itch.

Slowly got range of motion back, pain is still there but significantly less than before.

Right arm was consistently sore and hard to lift above head. About 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, my right arm, shoulder, upper back, hand, fingers, knee, ankle, foot, and toes all began to feel tight and lose sensation. By March 12, I was walking with a limp and struggled to move my right arm at all.

                                                received her COVID Moderna 1st dose vaccine on 3/15/21 in the late afternoon. After she had her vaccine she sat down in a chair and waited out her 15 minutes. During this time she said her ears were ringing and she felt faint. We switched her chair to one with larger arms to sit. She asked for water, we provided her a bottle of water and she started to breathe heavily. Her mom was with her and also was vaccinated waiting for 15 minutes. During this time her breathing became labored and she was feeling very faint. I called 911 and EMS arrived about 10 minutes later to see how she was doing. At no point did Taylor pass out or lose consciousness. She was cleared by EMS who checked her blood pressure which was normal and she did not have labored breathing after their visit. During the EMS check they asked the last time she ate and that was at 11 am. She declined medical transport to the hospital and was able to walk out of the facility.

She complained of feeling light-headed and nauseous about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  This continued for a short time and she also began to complain of feeling chilled and was noticeably diaphoretic.  I monitored her blood pressure, which was low on the initial reading and then eventually came up to a reading of 89/60 with a pulse of 73 at the point that her symptoms began to subside.  By approximately 45 minutes after the episode began, she reported feeling better and was able to stand and walk without symptoms.  She went home at that time with a friend.

I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

                                                There was a delayed reaction starting 7 days after first dose. Symptoms included redness and soreness at the site of injection and swollen lymph nodes in the armpit of the arm where the shot was injected. 12 hours after receiving the second dose I was shaking, nauseated, dizzy, sweating one minute and freezing the next, pain all over the body, my breathing slowed down and lastly there was a loud deafening ringing in my ears. These symptoms lasted a frightening 10 or so minutes leaving behind the bodily aches.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:30am. About a half hour after receiving the vaccine, I felt dizziness and very slight chest tightness. I took benadryl, and was relieved of these symptoms. Then, around 9pm that night, I developed a fever. The highest temperature I recorded was 101.9. I took Ibuprofen around 11pm, and was afebrile by 3am. I have not had any fevers since, and I did have to call off work New Year&#39;s day. I have had an intermittent, mild headache since receiving the vaccine as well,  but overall I feel fine.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                Gradual onset of soreness beginning about an hour post-vaccine and worsening throughout day. By the evening, left arm pain was too uncomfortable to wash dishes and lift household objects. Pain woke me up at 3am that night and I could not push the covers off of me, dress or undress, and I experienced severe pain with slight movement (7/10). Nausea and cold sweats began around 5am and lasted for 45min. I contacted the nurse via messaging system and was told to take OTC nausea medicine and Tylenol. I took the maximum dosage for Tylenol that day but could not do my normal school functions. The next day I was still limited by pain but did not require medication to cope. By day three, I had full range of motion back and minimal pain. Day four I am back to exercising normally.

It became very painful by the time I went to bed. 10x worse than a flu shot Next morning at 8am, got up and almost passed out. Went back to bed. Got up at 10. Arm was painful to move.  Began fever at 12 noon.  Highest was 102. Terrible chills and aches and pains throughout entire body... lasted through bedtime. Tylenol did not  manage the symptoms. Day 3 I was much better. I did experience fatigue, but arm pain was wearing off quickly.

Now on 01/16/2021, I started getting a cough, a sore throat, a  fever, and extremely tired. Then the next day the symptoms got worse and now I had a stuffy nose, inner ear pain, nausea, muscle aches all over my body, dizzyness, and chills. This continued into Sunday and now Monday.

                                                A few hours after receiving the vaccine I had muscle soreness onset in L deltoid near site of injection. A few hours after that I had moderate soreness in L deltoid, down L arm (bicep/tricep), and up into L pec and trap. I had difficulty abducting L arm to 90 deg but was not hindered in normal movements. Approaching midnight that day the soreness was improving and by mid next day it was limited to L deltoid upon palpation. After 2-3 days soreness resolved. No other adverse effects noted.   I have had very minor muscle soreness to a few vaccinations before, but not this bad. In those cases it has been limited to site of injection (deltoid) and less severe. Usually I don&#39;t notice anything after injections and I&#39;ve never had any other adverse effects.

I went to the Emergency Department and got Prednisone, Pepcid, and Benadryl.  The next day, I started to experience tremors, mostly in my right hand.   Two days later, I was so dizzy that the room was spinning and I could hardly stand up. Did not receive treatment for it.

These symptoms lasted for over a week. The only syncope episode was the morning after the vaccine.

                                                Patient only had muffin and coffee that day early in am. Had some arm pain after shot no other reaction.  Did go home felt some nausea . Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                Following the second phase around 5pm the intense feeling being extremely cold and despite being under 4 covers and a heated blanket I did not find relief. At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

                                                Vaccine around 3:30pm. Went to bed that same night with slight arm pain. Throughout the night arm pain got progressively worse and could not sleep due to extreme  pain and inability to move through range of motion, in addition to night sweats.  (did not have a fever). Woke up the next morning with a severe headache and nausea. Fainted around 10am (18 hours post vaccination). Headache and minor dizziness continued throughout the rest of the day.  By 24 hours post vaccine, no symptoms besides very minimal arm soreness.

At 10:30pm began to feel chills and body aches. 11:00pm  got very hot and sweaty, hands began to tingle, vision became fuzzy around the edges, felt like I was going to pass out. Experienced tachycardia, tachypnea, and headache. 12:20am- vomited. Restless sleep through the night, chills, fever (100.6-99.6 on Tylenol), body aches, joint pain, stomach ache, woke at 5:00am.  1/26- spent all day vomiting. At least once every hour. Continued tachycardia, tachypnea, stomach ache,  fever, headache, body aches,  and joint pain. At 7:00pm took Zofran and I stopped vomiting. Still nauseous. Could not eat all day.  1/27- woke up with headache and slight body aches but otherwise felt okay during the day. Was hungry and able to eat. Starting at 10:00pm my stomach began to hurt again. Experienced bloating, sharp stabbing pain and nausea. Felt like I needed to vomit or pass a bowel movement but could not do either. Took Zofran at 11:00pm, did not help in relieving my GI symptoms. Still on round-the-clock extra strength Tylenol. Could not eat all night.   1/28- woke up still with headache, and mild-moderate stomach pain.  Able to eat a couple bites of food.

It is now Friday and I am still having very bad joint and muscle pain when I walk and move and still have a headache and fatigue/weakness.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

I had not felt great from the moment I got up on Sunday, and felt progressively worse throughout the day. I had really bad body aches and chills, to the point where I was shivering, even with three layers and a puffy coat on. I normally never get cold. I also had a really bad headache. By the time my shift was over at 1pm, I wasn?t even sure I could trust myself to drive home. Eventually I decided it was fine, but by the time I got home I felt so terrible that it took me at least 15 minutes to get out of the car. I took a hot shower and went to bed. I was shivering violently, even with lots of blankets, and couldn?t even sit up to drink some water. I laid in bed for hours, doing absolutely nothing and feeling miserable. I got up after 7:00 pm to eat some dinner and felt so nauseous that I was dry-heaving into the toilet.

The majority of these symptoms started around 12 hours after the vaccination, with fever, chills, headache and dizziness being the most prominent. Ibuprofen (200mg) was taken about 18 hours in (as was advised to only take within the first 24 hours). Most of the symptoms are gone now after 24 hours of vaccination and taking ibuprofen. While most other symptoms are gone, there is still continued fatigue, and slight headache and nausea.

The following morning I woke up and got dressed and used the restroom. I proceeded downstairs to make my coffee.  As I was doing so I became dizzy and nauseous. I sat down on the floor and then I lost my vision and hearing. I broke out in a profuse sweat and had no concept of time. My boyfriend was with me and said it took 5-10 minutes before I began to normalize. I apparently had shallow breathing and turned pale white including my lips, I slowly regained awareness although I never fully lost consciousness. 911 was called and paramedics arrived. by this time I had begun to normalize with most of my vision returning. I ended up declining to see medical attention because I normalized and told the paramedics I would seek attention if it came back.  * please note the physician listed is my PCP but I was not seen for this reaction.

Approximately 13 hours after vaccination, I began to feel nauseous, dizzy, and shaky along with my earlier symptoms. I felt like I was going to faint with blurred vision and ringing in my ears even while lying down. I started sweating along with the chills. The dizziness and nausea subsided after approximately two hours. The headache lasted approximately 48 hours after the vaccination.

Patient called a friend to take her home once she was feeling better so she wasn&#39;t left alone.

Felt very weak and was walking out of kitchen when I felt extremely nauseous for about 10 seconds then started to stumble and dropped my water as I fell. Got back up and tried getting more water and then I fully fainted and woke up slightly confused on the floor.  Felt slightly better after and called my PCP?s on call doctor who told me I did not need to go to the ER. Woke up with body aches/mild fever still and a headache from hitting my head

                                                Joint pain and cracking at shoulder lasting a whole week now. After receiving my injection, I noticed that it was given very high up on my arm, just barely 1 finger width&#39;s away from my shoulder joint. As a healthcare provider myself, I know to be aware not to administer too high as this can result in shoulder injury. I unfortunately seem to have encountered this firsthand myself. I wanted to wait a week hoping the pain would go away, but it is still there even after a week. It was severe pain starting about 36 hours after receiving the shot, then for two more days, the pain was about 8/10. The pain has become less severe over time, but I am unable to use my left arm to the same capacity anymore due to this constant shoulder joint pain. Prior to this, I have never had any shoulder pain.

About an hour after receiving vaccine,  she went through a drive thru to order food and &#39;wasn&#39;t thinking right, like I had brain fog&#39;.  That lasted a short time.  About an hour after receiving vaccine, patient noticed lips and mouth were tingling &#39;like I had ate something really spicy&#39;.  This lasted off an on for about an hour.  Later that evening, patient felt dizzy and nauseated.  She laid down and took a nap and woke up feeling better.  Skin started to feel itchy that night.  On 2/27/21, patient woke up with an itchy rash all over back.  Rash is still there.  No other symptoms at this time.

The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

                                                That evening I had slight chills, low fever and body aches, which went away by the next day. The next morning, I had a severe tightening of the left side of my neck and shoulder, along with arm soreness. I saw my Physical Therapist and was told that it was a result of the vaccine. I was fine until I got the vertigo Friday evening. It came on really quickly and I&#39;ve never experienced it before. I was okay the next morning with the exception of a headache, which lasted for about a month after that. My doctor offered shots for them, but I couldn&#39;t take them due to my current meds. I was told to come back if they continue.

Prior to injection, patient reported being nervous about fainting. She reported no prior history of fainting due to vaccination or blood draws; she &#34;passed out&#34; two years prior to dehydration at a music festival.  Approximately four minutes after injection, patient stated that she was going to &#34;pass out&#34; and had an episode of syncope. She exhibited pallor, dry heaving, and arm contractures. The nurse helped her to a supine position on the floor and called for assistance. The nurse team encouraged deep breathing and provided apple juice, pretzels, ammonia inhalent, and cool washcloths. EMS was called and arrived at 1045 for further assessment. Patient reported that she had not consumed any food or drink prior to vaccination and stated that her hands were &#34;tingly&#34;. EMS took blood pressure and heart rate; both were within normal range. The patient was taken to the hospital by EMS at 1055, where providers determined that syncope was likely caused by anxiety. Patient returned home and reported feeling tired but stable when health department called to check in at 1400.

                                                I have been experiencing intense upper arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow.  I am not able to lift my arm.  My blood work shows inflammation markers and low levels of ANA and IFA markers.  I did not have any of these symptoms or markers before taking the vaccine.  I am not able to go to work.  I have seen a primary care physician and a neurologist.  When taking the steroid Prednisone, the pain does subside, but I am not allowed to take a steroid for more than one week.   I stopped taking my second dose of Prednisone 4 days ago, and now all the pain has returned and I cannot lift my arm.  This situation is frustrating and scary.  The doctors do not have a diagnosis or treatment plan.  Pain relievers do not help at all.

                                                awoke at 2 am  with nausea, chills, generalized pain. Immediately felt myself start to pass out or have a seizure- I am not sure which. Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

All the major symptoms finally subsided Saturday night around 6 pm. Saturday till Sunday I have felt fatigued and sore but otherwise fine.

No history of anaphylaxis. She received vaccine at 5:42. Felt lightheaded and dizzy about 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine. She noted chest tightness and tachycardia symptoms. We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.  Suspect anaphalxis reaction given rapid decline in status while talking with her. epic pen at bedside immediately and then due to increasing heart rate and complaints of chest discomfort gave her epipen times one. Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

Ache-type pain radiates down the arm and across the upper back. For the last 2 days, it hurts whether or not I?m moving it. The vaccine was given far too high in the arm.

These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

Arm was sore for the first two days.  One week later (1/22), injection site became itchy, red and was very warm to the touch.  A welt formed as well. It started out the size of a silver dollar, and over the course of  48 hours the welt, itchiness, and redness grew to  the size of a large russet potato (Friday 1/22- Saturday1/23).  It was the most red around the injection site, with the most red being about the size of a silver dollar.  After 48 hours, it remained itchy, red, and had a welt  for the next 24 hours  (Sunday 1/24). The next morning (Monday 1/25) redness and swelling were gone but site was still a little itchy.  Site was only slightly tender throughout these three days but not painful. No other side effects were noticed i.e. fever, chills, chest pain.  Slight dizziness was felt if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything.

Three days after receiving the vaccine, I started having axillary pain. I am still experiencing this pain.

                                                After about two hours my arm pain was so intense it felt like it was nearly broken and continued to feel worse. I had EXTREME headache and nausea which nearly led to vomiting but kept having to hold it down while alternating between Advil and Tylenol and Tums just to feel a little relief. Pain medications did not help substantially for the first 36 hours. I felt bed bound , had no energy to even move to pick up the TV control a few feet away from me. I had SEVERE chills, and still have them nearly 56 hours out with the headache and nausea still prevalent . I had such bad body aches and dizziness. Have had a hard time getting sleep because of the intensity of my symptoms. Absolutely has been the worst ever and I would NEVER get this shot again. Y?all need to do better. This is completely unacceptable for this to be side effects experienced by people even if it?s less than 10% experiencing the severity I felt. This is so messed up on so many levels. I?m going into medicine myself and although I believe in vaccines, this is not one I will be advocating for until research gets it together and provides a vaccine that is safer for people to receive. Completely anxious and worried and scared as to how my next few days and weeks will go especially with how severe my side effects have been and the news articles showing how some people seem to be dying within hours or days of the Moderna and Pfizer shots. Unacceptable. I can?t believe the amount of fear for my life I have right now.

Flu like symptoms starting that evening (unsure what time, as I was trying to sleep). Arm soreness where I received the vaccine, muscle aches that kept waking me up throughout the night, headache, fever, slight congestion, chills and sweating, nausea, dizziness when I stand up, fatigue. As of 4:00 PM on 1/29 (the day after the vaccine) I am still experiencing this list of flu-like symptoms.

However, she suddenly began to experience nausea, chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, throat tightness, light headed, and overall shaky.

Patient reports overall feeling better now with only continued tingling in her tongue and fingers, as well as feeling mildly light headed. Patient also states her throat continues to feel tight, but denies any throat swelling. Chest tightness and palpitations have since improved, only with occasional flutters in her chest similar when feeling excited. Denies nausea, rash, itchy skin, or abdominal pain. No history of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions. Patient is prescribed Nexium, but denies taking any other daily medications.  Physical exam shows to be unremarkable with no rash or throat swelling/erythema. Patient does not appear in respiratory distress. Lung sounds are clear.   Will order an EKG. Will administer IV Epipen and IV Benadryl.   Differentials: Allergic Reaction   EKG shows NSR with sinus arrhythmia. Otherwise normal with a rate of 87 bpm.

This was longer.  I had no control of my body, I was conscious the second time.  I attempted to tell myself to &#34;focus&#34; and try and find something with my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t; I was stuck in the state of my body shaking and unable to see anything. After the two times, I had the shakes.

                                                With the second dose I felt arm pain at the injection site and muscle pains, my whole body was aching, specially my arms, both of them. My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 3pm 1/13/21. I was fine for the 30 minutes after, not even sore at the injection site.  Around 6pm, my muscles started aching, but not painful enough to be concerned.  At 3am 1/14/21, I woke up in pain in every muscle. Enough to wake me, but not terrible.  At 7am, I noticed a pinpoint pain in my armpit, and my muscles still ached.  At 9:30am, I took ibuprofen to attempt to curb the pain a bit.  Around 10am, it got so painful I was limping, and having trouble bending down or reaching above shoulder height.  At 11:30am, I noticed the pinpoint pain in my armpit had gotten worse, and there is a hard, approximately quarter-sized round lump in this spot. Very painful.  At 2:30, I went to move my shirt sleeve and the pain at the injection site was so intense I screamed when I touched it.  This pain continued until 1/16/21 when I woke up feeling entirely normal.  Since 1/16/2021, my hands have been randomly stiffening, either completely stretched out and dropping anything in them, or closing tight enough to leave fingernail marks on my palms. I will also reach to grab things and my hands will sometimes bend into odd shapes, instead of what I intended for them to do. This began at 1-2 times a day, and is becoming more often. It is now up to 2-4 times daily.

                                                Pain began in upper right arm and radiated down to wrist for first week. Upon slightest movement around arm, pain ensued even worse as is and did not allow sleep. Pain has  limited shoulder mobility for 2 weeks. Received Hydrocodeine-acetiminophen and Ibuprofen at ER on Monday January 25 for 3 days. Then, upon follow up with PCP, medication for pain relief was prescribed as followed: ibuprofen 800 mg and Gabapentin. Pain has subsided but remains upon slight movement of shoulder.

It has now been over 72 hours and I am still having dizziness and my head is spinning almost constantly, especially when I move around.

I took advil to combat it, which helped, but it always came back until around 7:00 PM the following day. Along with this, my body ached making it tough to move. Once these two side effects went away, the next two days consisted of a severe migraine when bending down and standing up. This particular side effect did not affect my daily life, though.

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

                                                Around 5 pm on 2/11 (day of vaccination) I began to notice a very sore arm and dry mouth/dehydration. Drank water and continued as normal. Around 2 am of 2/12 I woke up with chills and had been sleeping very restlessly.  I had body aches in my arm, legs and back. Around 3am my temperature was 100.2. I also felt very faint when standing and thought I may pass out.  3 times when standing, I had to quickly sit down to avoid it. I do suffer from vasovagal syncope so this may be unrelated to vaccination. I took Tylenol and drank more water. Temp rose to about 100.6 before beginning to drop at around 4 am. I continued to take Tylenol every 4 hours and it helped keep temp below 100 but towards the end of the 4 hours, it would start to rise again. I ate normally and drank extra water due to feeling dehydrated still. Around 1 PM 2/12 I started to feel nauseous and had an upset stomach. I was still have a general body aches and elevated temperature around 99.5. My normal temp is usually about 98.0. Nausea led to diarrhea 1 time. Symptoms continued until approximately 8 pm when very quickly the body aches, nausea, fever and soreness in injection arm all went away. None of these symptoms have returned and it is now 2/13 at 8 pm.   I did test positive for Covid-19 on December 28, 2020 but have been fully recovered with no symptoms since 1/8/2021.

About 5 hours after the vaccine, I started getting side effects of a fever, chills, body aches, and a headache. On 2/14/21, I noticed a rash at the vaccination site. It does not itch, but appears to be spreading on the same arm of the vaccination.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

I went to bed and my body wouldn?t warm up under the covers. I woke up around 1:16am feeling very hot. I was running a fever of about 102F. After removing the covers and using a cold compress it dropped to the 99F range and fluctuated quickly between about 98.7F-99.9F. I continued to have chills and feel very cold during this fluctuation. When I would stand to go to the bathroom my body would be very weak and I would get almost lightheaded.  I fell asleep by about 3:30am. The following morning my fever was completely resolved. I continued to feel weak during the first half of the day with some mild intermittent nausea. By the second half of the day my side effects resolved entirely.

                                                I have had floaters in my eyes since the vaccine. I started to use  refreshing eye drops on Saturday March 13. I am not sure if the acne cream got in my eye the night before the vaccine. it is called Retin A cream 0.025%. I have also been feeling very weak. I got a B12 injection on my butt for energy(Friday, march 12). My legs feel like they are in pain and the hurt when I walk. I also had a lot of pelvic pain after the vitamin injection. I drank ibuprofen March 14 at night. I woke up feeling very weak. Before going to bed on March 15 I drank Tylenol. I still feel pain in my legs today and now I have lower back pain.

                                                Patient  came to the center for a Moderna vaccine at 5pm. The patient expressed that she felt dizzy shortly after immunization (before leaving the immunization chair). Her head began to fall backwards so I quickly supported the patient&#39;s head and neck area and was able to keep her from falling out of her chair. The patient fainted but regained consciousness approximately 3 seconds later. The patient came back alert but nauseous. The patient vomited in a trashcan and then felt fine. The patient blamed the reaction on her severe anxiety and said the exact same thing happened after a nose piercing. I observed the patient for 30 minutes and sent her on her way. The patient left healthy and happy. I told the patient to warn the pharmacist prior to receiving her second dose. No drugs were administered. Written up in SCRT and VAERS. I followed up with the patient at 7 pm and she was home safe.

                                                Patient was vaccinated around 10:55 AM. Within a couple of minutes she started feeling lightheaded, sweaty, and had blurry vision while sitting. She reported no history of blood sugar issues, but she said she only had some donut to eat today. I initially gave her three glucose tablets and a bottle of water, which she sipped. She reported feeling better within a few minutes. I checked her blood pressure at 10:59 AM. It read low at 81/44 with a pulse of 73. But, I checked again since I doubted the accuracy of the reading. The second reading was 101/56, with a pulse of 79. Patient said she was feeling better, but continued to sit. I gave her one more glucose tablet to equal a total of 16 g of carbs given. She sat for at least fifteen minutes until she felt well enough to get up and shop. She checked back after shopping and said she was fine.

A couple minutes later she was feeling better, but she was asked to remain sitting for another 10 mins to monitor her. She claimed to be dehydrated, and had not eaten much of anything today. Her friend brought her some water and food. After eating a bit and drinking the water she said she was feeling almost normal. We provided a motorized cart for her even though she said she was fine to walk. I gave the patient a follow up call a few hours later and she claimed to be feeling fine.

I have a history of these, but they are almost never so intense.  About 25 hours after the injection, I began having intense pain in the center of my chest. It dissipated and returned a couple of times over the next 5 hours or so. The pain was so great that it was difficult to stand, and I came close to passing out. I have not experienced this severe level of pain since about 30 hours post-injection.

                                                That evening my arm swelled up and became very painful - not as much as the first vaccine. I had a hard time sleeping - nausea and headache throughout the  night. 4/3 - extremely tired; felt like I couldn&#39;t get enough air (shortness of breath) body aches and muscles aches - over all lethargic. 4/4 - I was dizzy, short of breath . Those two symptoms lasted along with fatigue - which lasted for two days. I almost passed out that day - everything went black and I had to be assisted to the couch to recover from that.  I used Tylenol for my symptoms when needed.   I still have ongoing headaches - three weeks ago (about a week after I got the vaccine) - I noticed I was having ongoing headaches and I still have these.  Pregnancy - 2nd pregnancy; 1st one was full term. Date of delivery expected - September 9, 2021.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

                                                I walked in to received my first dose of the Moderna Covid19 vaccine at approx 12:20pm 1/7/21. The RN who was giving me my injection palpated the top of my shoulder and NOT my acromian process and administered the injection closer to the top of my shoulder, the vaccine did initially hurt more than a typical vaccine would when it was being administered but i thought that might have been normal. Approximately 1hr after receiving the vaccine my left shoulder joint started to have this pinching sensation in the anterior joint when I would raise my arm forward. The pain got progressively worse throughout the day with significantly decreased range of motion in that shoulder and significant pain in my shoulder joint. The pain was so bad it actually kept me from sleeping that night. I never had any muscular pain or any other symptoms beside the joint pain, which was alarming since it should have been administered into the muscle. I believe the vaccine my have been incorrectly injected into the shoulder joint or potentially a smaller muscle in the shoulder. The pain and decrease ROM is preventing me from doing most of my regular day to day activities. Today 1/9/21 has been a full 48hrs after receiving the vaccine and the joint pain has not gotten any better and my range of motion is still significantly decreased, which would prevent me from performing my tasks as an RN.

Unsure of exact vaccination date and onset of symptoms.  really having to focus to place hands under water to wash them, walking through doors without bumping into them, turning on faucet, getting dressed; left hand is worse than right and not able to easily align things properly;  &#34;feels like her brain isn&#39;t doing what she&#39;s telling it to do&#34;.  Aunt said the symptoms are not improving. Patient had tested negative for Covid the day she got the vaccine.

On Tuesday 1/5/2021 developed hives on feet and ankles. Dizziness worsened and hives had spread to hands and wrists the following day. Upon arriving to work on Thursday 1/7/2021, hives had progressively gotten worse and I was tachycardic. Called employee health where I was instructedto go to the ED. Was tachycardic 100-130 bpm and hypertensive 156/112mmHg upon arrival to the ED. Received IV Benadryl and Decadron for the reaction/hives. Viotals were normal upon discharge. Continued with Prednisone and benadryl. Taking Meclizine to help with dizziness.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

Her husband got the attention of the paramedic overseeing the area. She did not become unresponsive at any time but became very pale. Her BP was 80/40 when initially checked. EMS was call and she was shortly thereafter taken to a local ED via non emergent transport. Her husband had driven her to the pod site and did not receive a vaccination.  She was discharged home yesterday.

                                                I received my vaccine around 12:45pm. They had me go to waiting room and wait for 10 mins. I sat down and was waiting for a few minutes when I started to get dizzy. I looked up and told the lady checking people in ?hey I?m getting really dizzy can I lay down? she said yes come in the room. When I stood up my heart started beating really fast. I sat on the table and my chest started feeling tight and heavy. There were 2 ladies in the room at this point so I asked one of them if they had an epipen on hand just in case. My throat wasn?t swelling but it was getting harder to breath from the tightness in my chest. She said they didn?t have an epipen and would have to call emergency services if I needed one. I told her I didn?t know what was going on, that I didn?t need one yet but she should probably call emergency services if they can?t do anything to help me. (ER is right across the street) my symptoms went away shortly after they called. But came on a couple more times but much milder over the next 30 minutes or so. The EMT gave me Benadryl and the ER ran some tests.

I then began feeling lightheaded and dizzy about 2 hours after vaccination. Shortly after I became feverish with chills. I then took 2 Ibuprofen and fever/chills subsided, however lightheadedness continued but improved slightly.

                                                Several minutes after the vaccine she became light headed, EMT evaluated her and stated she was tachycardic (did not give a pulse) and was initially unable to find a BP.  She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

                                                By 3:30pm I had a fever and experienced arm soreness to my right arm. By 11:30pm I could not move my arm and also could not pick my son up who  weighs 30 pounds. On the following day I continued with severe  body aches  and joint pain. I went to see a doctor about 10:00am who examined me and advised my to take Tylenol and Ibuprofen  for pain.  They did a Covid-19 swab which as negative.  My symptoms are improving and I can say that it took about 24 to 48 hours to recover from my right arm.

Several hours later the aches moved to upper body aches causing pain breathing. Upon night, dizziness had set in. I fell unconscious hitting my head and received treatment for a concussion. I am currently pending a CT Scan to check for brain bleeding.

She was placed in a recumbent position on the exam twith legs elevated and vital signs were obtained, they were within normal limits. Pt then reported that it felt like she had something in the right side of her throat - she declined epinephrine injection. RN and LVN stayed at bedside. Pt then stated that both sides of her throat felt blocked and gave consent for epinephrine injection. RN administered 0.3 mg epinephrine and activated EMS. Vitals signs, breathing and circulation monitored closely until EMS arrival. Pt was transported by ambulance to the hospital emergency department for evaluation.

After around 15 minutes or so after vaccination, she was feeling little light headed, and nauseating and tried throwing up during the observation period as per protocol after vaccination. We advised her to stay longer and  as precaution, we reached out to our facility, who advised to observe her for some more time and if she does not feel better, she can go to Urgent care accompanied by someone. We gave her Gatorade and after around 40-45 minutes she was feeling better and someone from her family came to pick her up. She did not wanted to go to Urgent Care at that time but we advised her if she does not feel good, she should go to Urgent Care.

Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

                                                I first got symptoms on Jan 19th with extreme muscle soreness from my shoulders to my toes with hives on my thighs and what felt like a bug bite on my knuckle and a circular bite on my left forearm.  The muscle soreness was there for 3 days.  It was very hard to walk for a while cause of just the soreness.  I still feel a little in my ankles and toes still but fully recovered.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

                                                Woke up around 5AM with a severe headache and tenderness at injection site. Throat was also very dry. Was not able to go back to sleep due to pain. Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

Had shoulder soreness day 2 post vaccine and was taking Motrin and Tylenol with some relief. Pain continued to get better. On day 9 post vaccine, pain returned with intensity and was seen at urgent care on 1/9. Shoulder was swollen and red at the time, so urgent care NP diagnosed cellulitis and I was prescribed Keflex, along with instruction to continue taking Motrin, Tylenol. Called out of work on 1/11 d/t shoulder pain/decreased range of motion. Today (1/13) pain is much better but still having some pain/discomfort in the shoulder.

                                                Approximately five minutes after receiving the shot, I began to feel a burst of pain rush through my entire left arm. A few seconds afterwards, I started to feel nauseated. Immediately, I felt weak, light-headed, and tired. I began to sweat profusely, as well. I could barely move my arm to flag down one of attendants who was monitoring us. She asked me what was wrong, and I tried to describe what was going on, but I could barely talk or keep my eyes open. She radioed for help and the paramedics came over to me. They wanted to move me to a private room and asked if I could walk. I tried to walk there, but I started to fall so one of the paramedics hoisted me up to help me. They asked me some questions will they were waiting for a stretcher, all of which I could hear and understand, but I was unable to response to. The stretcher came and I laid down, but I was already starting to feel better by then. I was very out of it, but I think this entire process took maybe 10-15 minutes. I laid there for maybe another 15 minutes, and I began to be able to talk again and open my eyes. I tried sitting up and that went alright. I answered some questions for them while they took my blood pressure, monitored my pulse, and took my temperature. After another 15 minutes or so, I felt well enough to walk back to my office in the Health Department. I didn&#39;t have any other problems for the rest of the day.

It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 21 Jan 2021, approximately two hours prior to the start of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 032L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Approximately two hours after receiving the vaccine at 12:30 pm, the patient experienced heavy feeling in her neck and face area that hurt really bad. Later, she noticed numbness in her hands and feet. Slurred speech was reported from a bystander. By 3:30pm, the patient was completely paralyzed on her right side. She was taken to the hospital, and a code stroke was initiated; however, all labs were normal.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient was still paralyzed on her right side, unable to walk, had shooting pain feeling, and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly. The doctors planned to discharge her on the next day to a rehab center because she could not function alone.  Treatment for the event included pain medication and hospitalization.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly, unable to walk and shooting pain feelings were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 25-year-old, female, patient, who experienced heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly and shooting pain feelings. The events of heavy feeling in her neck and face area, numbness in her hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 032L20A, expiration date unknown). The events of inability to walk, had shooting pain feeling and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly occurred the following day after the vaccine administration. Treatment included pain medication and outcome is unknown. Based on the information provided, which indicates a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine (onset latency of 2 hours), a causal association cannot be excluded.

The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

                                                Starting about 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt feverish (no fever), lightheaded and dizzy. The doctor on site had me wait for an hour until I felt well enough to drive home. Over the next several hours, my lightheadedness became so bad I felt as though I would faint if I stool for longer than a few minutes. On Saturday, 2-13-21, I did pass out on the stairs and again in my livingroom. On Sunday, 2-14-21, I decided to go to urgent care in which I was told to &#34;wait it out&#34;. However, my symptoms had gotten worse over the last couple days to include body aches, headaches, muscle/joint pain, congested sinuses, slight cough, and feeling feverish (no fever) along with being dizzy. Therefore, I went to the ER later that morning 2-14-21, to see if I could get better treatment for my symptoms. I received IV fluids and they preformed blood work, a urinanalysis and an ECG. I was released from the ER around 8pm. My symptoms were better for the remainder of the evening, but have gone back to what I was feeling before for the last several days. My symptoms have been unresolved now for 1 week. I am getting tested for COVID-19 on Saturday 02-20-21.

                                                I was hurting a lot. 8 out of 10 - the pain. My arm was so but my chest was in pain. I couldn&#39;t breathe. I was so light headed I thought I would pass out if I stood up. I went to ER - Dr thought it was  from my wearing personal protection equipment - mask and goggles for work after receiving the vaccine. He told me I was fine but I was so much in  pain that I was too out of it to ask for tests. I was in pain for two week. Chest was in pain.  I had to use my inhaler once a day at least - sometimes more.

I took 2 extra strength Tylenol at that time, put an ice pack on my forehead, and drank a Pedialyte.   In addition to those, at about 4 I had ringing in my left ear and then lost the hearing in it. I just went to bed. When I woke up, around 10am on Friday, I could hear, but super dizzy. I couldn?t really walk without  feeling like I?m going to fall over, especially with turns. All symptoms continued throughout all of Friday.  I continued to take the Tylenol per the instructions on the bottle with my last dose around 5pm, I also drank 3 more pedialytes throughout the day in addition to plenty of other fluids. Took a warm shower around 7PM which seemed to help some with body aches and chills, however, dizziness/vertigo remained.  Saturday I woke up several times drenched in sweat. Around 9am my fever was gone. Still feeling a little ?off? in terms of balance/vertigo but nothing compared to Friday.  Slight body aches remain. Other symptoms gone.

                                                Around 6:00 pm on the day of vaccination I started to feel very fatigued and developed body aches - this felt similar to the beginning of developing Covid-19 symptoms. (I had Covid-19 back in November of 2020)   Around 8:00 pm I had developed some head congestion and swollen lymph nodes along with some throat pain and sinus congestion - again feeling very similar to Covid-19 symptoms.   Around 10:00 pm as I was heading to bed the symptoms became  a lot worse, I had pretty intense body aches and started to experience chills as well as a slight fever (around 99.5 in F). At this time the symptoms felt similar to how I had felt during the worst of my previous Covid-19 symptoms, very weak and achy, headache was very bad, and felt very uncomfortable overall.   Around 2:00 am on March 13 I woke up with a fever of 101.8. The previous symptoms had also gotten worse, I was having a hard time getting out of bed because things were very uncomfortable, I drank a lot of water and took some ibuprofen to combat the fever, about an hour after this the fever had come down to about 99.9 and I was able to fall asleep, but before taking the medication I couldn&#39;t have fallen asleep because of the discomfort of the aches, chills, and fever.   Throughout the following day I was unable to complete many of my day to day activities without taking a daytime cold and flu medication. With the medication I still felt sick but was able to walk around and complete some simple household chores, this carried through into the evening, when the medication wore off the chills and aches and headache were much worse and I still had a fever around 99-100. That night I was able to sleep with the cold and flu medication taken right before bed.  Upon waking up the next morning (March 14) I still had some congestion, headache, and general discomfort but the worst of the aches were gone and I no longer had a fever, these symptoms continued to diminish throughout the day.   On March 15 and March 16th I have had a slight lingering congestion headache, this also feels really similar to the lingering headache I had upon recovering from Covid-19. It is not debilitating and is continuing to improve. Otherwise I am feeling healthy again and have been able to complete my usual activities and even exercise.   Overall the symptoms felt like a couple days of having Covid-19 again, but recovery was much faster, and it was definitely worth receiving that first dose of the vaccine and getting started with the process of doing my part to reduce community spread.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.

                                                These were symptoms after 2nd shot.  I started with a mild headache and sore arm. Then things got worse. At night on Wednesday, 24th, I got a severe headache that was at the back of my neck and could feel in the back of my head. Then I became so achy. My bones and joints hurt so much. It hurt to sit or lay down. All I could feel is the pain in my joints. I became so weak and so achy that I could barely get up and walk to the restroom. I could it stand for more than 2 minutes due to the pain. The subsided slightly on Thursday night, 25th, at 6pm. But then returned in another way. I became very nauseous and dizzy. My muscles instead of my bones began to hurt extremely. I could barely move. I broke down crying a couple of times due to the pain being so intense. Throughout this time, I did try to eat or snack and continue to drink water and Gatorade.  Then finally the pain just all of a sudden went away on Friday, 26th, at 1:00pm. I felt like a different person. The pain was gone. The only lingering effect was when I would get up from sitting down, I would be dizzy and my head would throb for a few seconds. That went away on Saturday night, 27th.  I will say if that type of pain had continued on much longer, I might have had my husband take me to the Emergency Room.

                                                I received my first Covid - 19 vaccine on March 25, 2021. The next day I felt extremely dizzy starting around 4:00pm. This was able to be resolved by increasing hydration. The following morning I felt much better with no other side effects. Just over a week later (4/2/21) I woke up around 7:00am and noticed a rash around the injection sight. It is not itchy but it feels warm and hard to the touch. The shape is somewhat of an irregular  oval about two inches long and an inch wide. I also have a smaller circular spot just below the larger spot. The rash is currently only located on my left arm right near the injection site.

Her vision blurred; she felt dizzy; she had a hard time hearing herself, although she could hear me fine; and she felt faint.  We had her sit back down and got her some water, checking on her every 5 minutes or so.  She was still dizzy, but not as faint.  She also reported a cold sweat.  We got her some orange juice and continued checking on her.  She called her husband to come and get her.  She was able to get up and walk out of her own accord with her husband.  We will follow up with her tonight to see how she is doing.

I decided to drink some orange juice and when I went to sit back down I started feeling extremely dizzy, I got a very bitter taste in my mouth, my whole body started tingling and my lips and tongue and hands especially started feeling numb.I managed to get to bathroom floor where I grabbed some water and wiped it over my neck but I continued to feel worse where I couldn?t even control what my body was doing and I had diarrhea. The ?snow? in front of my eyes got worse too where I couldn?t almost see anything for over probably 3 minutes and I broke in cold sweat.After the diarrhea I had a very sharp pain in my lower abdomen. That all lasted a few minutes and I didn?t have phone on me and I was alone so I helplessly sat on the floor through it all til I started feeling bit by bit better.The fever continued for 48 hours as well as extreme arm pain for 3 days where I got my vaccine.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after the patient got her second moderna vaccine she became faint and dizzy. The patient was sitting at the time. A law enforcement officer witnessed her becoming faint and ran over to attend her. I was called over to assess her as well. The law enforcement officer called EMS. The patient stated that she felt faint, dizzy, she said she had a headache, blurry vision, and was nauseous. The patient appeared sweaty and she appeared to loose consciousness briefly twice. She did not show any signs of redness, rash, or swelling. After sitting for a few minutes, and before EMS arrived, the patient said she was improving. She did not lose consciousness anymore but she still had a headache, nausea, and blurry vision. When EMS arrived they recommended that she get checked out at the emergency room, but the patient refused stating that she did not want to go to the hospital and that she was feeling better. The patient called her parents and they came and picked her up.
