                                                Approximately 7-8 minutes after receiving the vaccine, started to feel light-headed, thought she was going to pass out, and her heart was racing extremely high. The health care team at the site took her blood pressure, measured heart rate, gave her water, juice and chocolate and tried to get her heart rate to drop. It was fluctuating up and down and she couldn&#39;t stand up without dizziness;  we waited 45 minutes and then drove her home as she was unable to drive her own car.  She was experiencing significant lightheadedness, and consistent heart racing even while lying down on the sofa/bed. This continued for several days and she stayed home from school and sports. We called her primary care doctor on the 10th and they suggested she wait another day to see how she was feeling. She started to feel a bit better by Friday, was still experiencing a bit of the tiredness, nauseous, light-headed and heart spikes, but was able to drive, move around.  On Sunday evening, she started to experience increased heart rate again, lymph nodes were very painful and started experiencing the light headedness all evening.  On Monday we took her to her primary care provider and they then referred her to ER for the heart racing and a EKG. The increased light headedness, feeling like she will pass out even while laying in bed, dizziness has all increased and her lymph nodes continue to be swollen and painful. It has been over a week since the vaccine and there is no clear sign of her reaction getting any better, if not worse.  The EKG results indicated a new abnormality and we are trying to get her to a cardiologist.  She is and had been a very healthy, varsity athlete that runs over 30 hours a week with track, and since receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine is unable to move very far within the house without feeling that she is going to pass out or that her heart rate is shooting up uncontrollably.

Pharmacy staff placed the patient lying down on the floor, gave her a cool wet cloth and monitored her for worsening symptoms. Patient immediately began to feel better, less nauseated and cooling down. Attempted to follow up with patient later in the day, but she did not answer call.

                                                Initially she passed out following the vaccine - within 90 seconds- she has a history of passing out with injections and blood draws. Around noon she had a seizure. She describes a feeling of darkness and dread closing in on her and she was unable to speak or move. She was on the stairs at the time. I witnessed her stiffen, then go limp and fall between the electric stair hair and the wall. She hit the hardwood floor face first then she began to shake/twitch. She was unconscious. She awoke screaming, incoherent speech, and flailing limbs. It took about 5 minutes to calm her and be able to understand her speech. She only remembers the darkness and waking up scared and feeling awful. She was put supine on the floor with feet elevated, blood pressure monitored, given juice to drink, and vitals checked routinely. After about an hour supine and conscious, she felt good enough to sit up. She sat up for 15 minutes before she was able to stand with assistance. Family physician was notified immediately and we are still waiting for a response. She has a goose egg sized knot on her forehead, a bruise on the side of her face and a black eye from hitting the floor. She has a huge bruise on her outer thigh and lower leg where she hit the stair chair and then seized and it it repeatedly on the metal. She has underarm pain from where her armpit hit the edge of the stairs when she fell and seized. She has no history of any types of seizures.

                                                I had horrible shaking/trembling in my arms, chest, and legs about six hours after the vaccine, and they continued for about four hours more, uncontrollably. I passed out briefly around 12 hours after the vaccine, and I&#39;m not sure how long I remained unconscious. Through all of this, my left arm was difficult to move or use, I felt hot suddenly and then cold, and I was tired. The next day, the most serious side effects were gone, but I remained feverish, tired, and largely unable to move my left arm. Those side effects were gone on the third day and now I&#39;m better.

Unusual issues: The day after receiving the vaccine she had several hand tremors,  and feeling as if she had several &#34;mini seizures&#34; throughout the day, a few longer staring spells, some twitches.  She felt &#34;out-of it&#34; all day.   She has petite mal seizures and a history of interictal epileptiforn discharges.  Also history of an intention tremor in her hands. (The mild tremors were primarily in her right hand, to a lesser extent the left).   Today, 2 days afterwards, today, so far, she feels better.   Yesterday was terrible, but we waited it out assuming it was injection related.

                                                The 12:20 pm appointment today (4/20/21) had an adverse reaction to the IMZ. Patient was done receiving the vaccine at about 12:30 pm and I stated she would have to wait until 12:45 pm. Around 12:38 pm I noticed she looked a little pale and went to her side to check on her. The patient stated she was feeling light-headed, dizzy, nauseous, and had trouble with her vision. I had the patient lay down and elevate her feet. The technician also grabbed an ice pack to place behind her neck. Asked if she would like water. The patient then stated she was having trouble breathing/short of breath and her ears were ringing. Once the patient stated issues with breathing 911 was called. A code white had been called and management was in the pharmacy. The 911 operator continued to ask questions about the patient&#39;s status and stated to not give any water or medications. I continued to assess the patient&#39;s symptoms. Her vision improved; however, she continued to feel light-headed, nauseous, and having trouble breathing. A member of EMS was in the store and came over to assess the patient. He had the patient sit up but she continued to have the same symptoms. He assessed her IMZ site. She was not feeling itchy and had not developed any hives. The ambulance arrived. EMS evaluated the patient and then took her out of the store on the stretcher.

                                                Patient seemed to be fine right after I administered the vaccine.  She sat in our room for 15 minutes then left.  She came back shortly saying she was feeling a little funny so she wanted to sit in our room.  She left again after several minutes then came back around 5:20 saying she felt like she was going to pass out.  I told her to sit in our waiting room.  She said she felt faint and had tightness in her chest. I called the paramedics who arrived shortly after.  They said she had anxiety.  She was anxious before and after receiving the vaccine.  She left on her own.

                                                Patient had felt nervous prior to getting her 2nd shot. I asked if she had every had any serious reactions from previous medicines or vaccines, she stated &#34;no&#34;. I then asked how she did after her first shot and she said ok. While waiting her 15 min in the observation area she alerted us that she was feeling extremely hot. We brought her back into the IMZ booth and had her sit in the chair and turned a fan in her direction. I sat down with her an asked her questions and kept her talking to try to calm her down. She stated that she felt as if the chair was swaying a little. We laid out a yoga mat on the floor in the booth, had her lay down and elevate her feet in a chair. She began to get upset and I asked if she had anyone with her, she was able to open her phone and gave me permission to call her family member. Family member came in the store and was able to help calm her down. We gave her some water and had her rest. I monitored her pulse and face/lip color. She became a little flushed. She was able to leave on her own accord, I did walk out with her to ensure she made it safely. I called 2 hours later to check on her and she stated she was feeling better, less dizzy, but just a little tired.

Patient reported no vision changes, no problems breathing or talking. She said she does not like needles and that could have been the issue. I asked her to remain seated in observation and got her a cup of water. She drank with no problems swallowing. Reported no other symptoms. After approximately 5 minutes patient reported feeling about the same. After an additional approximate 5 minutes patient reported feeling much better. She remained in observation for approximately 5 more minutes, totaling approximately 30 minutes and reported feeling good. I offered for her to remain in observation as she felt comfortable but at that point she said she felt good and would call the pharmacy with any questions or concerns.

She reports she had pain in her teeth and her chest felt tight. She just didn&#39;t feel well. Closer to incident student felt dizzy, like she was &#34;going to pass out&#34;.  States she turned to someone to tell that person she was not feeling well &#34;but I couldn&#39;t talk; the words would not come out&#34;. She felt herself sway and then knew she fell to the floor. She felt like she was lying still for a bit but she could hear people around her and she heard someone say &#34;somebody start timing this&#34; (as if they knew it was a seizure).

Immunizer then turned around to give her brother vaccination. When he was turned around, he heard the patient&#39;s phone that she was holding dropped and that she had jerked her arm, which caused her phone to drop. When I went to the patient, she was crying and hyperventilating. I told her to put her head down and take deep breaths. I checked on pt in 15 min, was doing better but had burning sensation at injection site. Kept pt at pharmacy for 30 minutes.

                                                Patient&#39;s boyfriend called over and stated she was reported feeling faint, lightheaded, dizzy, looked pale in the face and broke out into sweats and with cold clammy skin. I had her sit in head down position for several minutes and started to monitor her vitals. Prior to vaccine pt was having severe anxiety and has a history of syncope with blood drawns. After several mins of her sitting with ehr head down I checked her blood pressure and it was elevated 155/109 mmHg. 10 minutes later pt felt a little better but started to feel faint and dizzy again. I called emergency sevices and EMS arrived at the scene, assessed the patient and diagnosed her with anxiety/syncope. She opted out from going to the hospital with them. She left the store at 1:01 pm and felt alot better and stated she had an appt with her PCP at 3pm to further seek medical treatment if deemed necessary

I went to check on her and offered her a cold compress for the back of her neck to help her cool down.  After another 5 minutes I went to check on her and the patients mother said she still did not feel good and she would like to have her checked out.  I explained that what she was experience were normal side effects of the vaccine, and she still wanted me to call EMS.  I called 911 and spoke to the dispatcher about her symptoms.  EMS came and checked her blood sugar, and blood pressure which were fine.  They instructed her to rest and explained those were normal symptoms.  She was able to leave about another 10 minutes of resting.

The following morning, I woke up feeling well with the rash still on my arm (no change). 2 hours later I began feeling dizzy and fainted. I was unconscious for 5 to 10 seconds. When I woke up, the rash had vanished and the firmness was gone. No signs of the reaction were present after waking.

Needed assistance to stand and could not hold a pencil to write. Also numbness and tingling in hands and fingers. Face slightly swollen and red.  400 mg Ibuprofen was administered at  1530. Pushed fluids as soon as fever began. Cooling measures provided, cool shower, cold compress, change of clothes to light pajamas.  We contacted our Insurance 24 hour Nurse line at approximately 2100 when symptoms peaked. The RN on staff instructed us to seek immediate medical care.

She got her shot and was told to stay around for 15 minutes, she starting walking with her mom, when she told her mom she  felt dizzy, then she passed out unto her mom&#39;s arms,  her mom put her on the floor, did not heart her head.   Mom helped her to get up and came back to the pharmacy, sat her down again.   We called 911 for help, patient  asked for water, while her mom went to get her some water, pharmacist was watching her when she had a short convulsion for  about 2 to 3 seconds, she stretched her body to the  back.   When 911 came, she had already recovered her color,  her vitals where ok, she was breathing normal.  Patient refused to get on the ambulance, signed her release and left.  Emergency personel advised her to follow up with her doctor.

                                                I got the vaccine sometime in the afternoon and felt fine for the 15 minutes after the time of injection. I returned to work afterwards, and later that evening I started to feel chills, but it wasn&#39;t severe to the point where I went home. When I returned home from work, the chills remained but I also felt extremely exhausted which was unusual for me. I also had a bit of a headache/felt lightheaded. I took Tylenol which somewhat helped the symptoms. I felt fine after going to bed.

When RN and I reached patient she was very weak, she was sitting in a chair. I instructed her colleauges to call 911 immediately. Patient was having a little trouble breathing. I think she was scared. I gave her 10 mlL of benedryl and RN administered a 0.5 mL dose of epinephine in her left arm. Patient was helped to the  floor and her feet were elevated.  RN put on a blood pressure cuff. Before she could get a reading, the paramedics were there and took over. Patient was transported to Hospital.

Reported that she became dizzy, presyncopal feelings, and had a witnessed syncopal event. The patient stated she does have vasovagal syncopal events after blood draws in the past. The patient was assigned an overnight admission for a potential post-vaccination adverse event, new onset atrial fibrillation, dehydration, and syncope. Patient was discharged the following day.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

Patient presents on 1/27/2021 after onset of pain, decreased ROM ongoing since administration.  I was able to visualize ecchymotic area where vaccine was administered and patient has photo evidence.  The physician responsible for the vaccine administration needs to be retrained on where to give deltoid muscle IM injections and to avoid the extremities where recent surgeries occurred (patient had right shoulder labrum repair in October 2020)

Around 10pm I almost fainted going up the stairs (I turned white and felt the blood drain from my face, I got very dizzy and had to sit down with supervision). I woke up at 12:30am and had a fever of 101 F and took some acetometaphine to hopefully lower my fever. I checked my temperature again at 8:30am this morning (feb 20) and was at 99.5 F and a slight headache.

                                                After the patient had waited her 15 minutes she got up to leave; on the way to the door she said she began to feel weak, have slow reaction, dizziness, and felt warm to the touch. She cam back in side the room and we had a nurse assess her, her BP and heart rate were a  little elevated. We gave her some water and had her sit for some extra time while we talked to her. She has a child hood trauma regarding vaccine and had just had a major panic attack before and during her vaccination. We were all  pretty sure she had just worked her self up and was not feeling well because of that and she said as much herself. After about 15-20 more minutes her BP and heart rate were back to normal and although still feeling a little weak she was ready to go home with her mother.

Fifteen minutes late she returned to the pharmacy says she was dizzy and nauseated. We had her sit in the pharmacy for about 20 minutes at whichn time she said she felt better and was ready to go. We had one of our pharmacists walk her but she became dizzy and nauseated again and had to sit down. At this time she said she was hot and very light headed and her vision was starting to get blurry. A minute or so lefter that she sat up in her chair and stopped breathing and started to fall off. One of our pharmacists caugt her and at point she went into convulsions and started gagging and could not breath. 911 was called at this time and an Epi pen was administered. The convulsions stopped 30 seconds afer the Epi and her breathing eazed. The EmT&#39;s arrived with in 10 minutes and took her to local emergency room. Our pharmacist called the emergency room about a hour later and they said that She wwas doing well.

                                                I got my shot, sat down, and was reading through the information that the clinic provided me. A few minutes after, I noticed my right arm was getting warm, but I thought I was being paranoid (placebo effect). I began to feel nauseated. About another 5 minutes after feeling warm and nauseous, my ears began to ring and my vision went white. I was cold but sweating. I have passed out a handful of times before for various reasons, so I knew what was happening. I tried to signal to a volunteer from my seat that I needed help, but I ended up laying on the ground by my chair before someone came over. Once I laid down, the attention of the volunteers and nurses was on me. Three came over to assist me. They held my legs up,  kept a hand on my wrist for a pulse, and fetched water. I talked myself through the dizziness and ringing in my ears. They put a cold rag on my forehead and had smelling salts on hand. Once I began to feel better, they helped me slowly sit up, and eventually helped me stand up and get into a chair. They kept a close eye on me for the next 30 minutes to make sure I didn?t have any other reactions.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID 19 Moderna vaccine on Tuesday morning. By Tuesday night I started to have virtually every side effect that Moderna listed including; fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, and extreme fever. The next morning as I woke up in attempt tp get ready for work, I was not feeling any better and began to feel light headed, and felt the need to vomit. As I had the feeling of needing to vomit, I turned to do so and fainted. From accounts by my family, I was told I woke up, and quickly passed out a second time. As I was awoken, there was probably a minute before I fainted for a third time. All three times I was told I lost consciousness. I was awoken and by that point my family had contacted emergency responders. Paramedics arrived and took all necessary vitals. I did not pass out after that third time. As I expected all side effects Moderna listed, I did not expect to feel as bad as I did and I thought it was worth reporting what happened to be the next day. It caused a panic and I was scared and nervous as I was unsure why that was happening. I&#39;ve tried to look up articles and links between passing out and the vaccine and all I can find is people fainting as they get the vaccine (which is common for any shot) but nothing for fainting that long after the vaccine was administered. I just wanted to report my incident.

I was either really cold or really hot, no in between. I was fatigued for a week after the vaccine. I had shortness of breath and I got my vaccine on a Friday and was sick throughout the entire weekend until Tuesday.

Firefighters and patient&#39;s mother brought her outside the observation room for more privacy and sat patient down on a chair with her head tilted down, and patient regained consciousness within 1 to 2 minutes. Patient&#39;s blood pressure and pulse were both low and patient stated she couldn&#39;t hear out of her left ear. Firefighters decided to call the ambulance and send the patient to the nearest emergency room. I followed up with the patient the next day on 4/10/2021. Patient stated she had a vasovagal response to the injection and received IV fluids at the emergency room. Patient stated it was very unexpected and she had ate before coming to the clinic. She has not felt lightheaded or faint since the incident and is experiencing flu-like symptoms from the vaccine and has been taking Tylenol for it.

Patient was sitting in post vaccination waiting area chair. Approximately 10 minutes after vaccination, patient&#39;s mother alerted us for assistance. Patient was slumped over in chair and had fainted. Patient was pale and had complained of dizziness to her mother prior to passing out. Responded to patient and helped patient to the floor to avoid hitting her head. Called 911. Patient responded and woke up. Had patient continue laying on floor until EMS arrived. EMS took patient&#39;s blood pressure and blood sugar. No significant medical history or known allergies. No history of passing out after vaccinations. Patient said she had not eaten yet today. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was low and EMS indicated that patient was dehydrated.

Immediately after receiving the  shot, she said she felt like fainting. Her mother walked her to the observation chair for monitoring. She fainted and her mother along with two grocery associates went to hold her from falling off the chair. Two paramedics who happened to be a few feet away came to assist and took her vitals. Other medics arrived and took her to the hospital.

                                                I woke up the day after my second shot completely weak and felt very feverish. I got out of bed and tried to eat yogurt, but felt nauseous and got lightheaded so I had to sit down. I drank some tea and water and went back to bed for 4 hours. I woke up again and still felt terrible and could not even walk short distances without getting very pale, sweaty,  and my vision having spots. I feel chills, a headache, and have been lying down all day. I am most concerned about passing out and becoming unconscious.  I called the Wellness Center and they said to just lie down and stay hydrated

She came to the pharmacy and sat on the floor and when asked she explained what happened. She was told to lay down with feet elevated and she felt a bit better. She asked for water and she felt better. She laid down for 15 minutes and said she could leave but we asked her to stay seated and see how she feels and then after another 15 minutes she said she is fine and left and after an hour called to let us know she is feeling fine.

                                                A few minutes after getting the vaccine she started getting light-headed, nauseous, sweats, and blurred vision prior to getting up and informing the pharmacy staff. Pharmacist gave water. She had turned a yellow color. Mother gave liquid Benadryl - adult dose. Epi was offered - but not use.  Decided to see if Benadryl got her back to normal. After the sweat she got chilled. Waited at the pharmacy for about an hour as her color came back to normal.  Had pharmacists take her blood pressure prior to leaving. It was 106/70. Which would be close to her normal range.  Pharmacist initially had trouble getting pulse and blood pressure but was also using the same arm the vaccination was put into. Pharmacist got that blood pressure off the alternate arm. She went to lunch with Mother afterwards. Mother stayed with her until around 4:00 p.m. Shot was around 12:30 p.m. She went to sleep when she got back to her dorm and missed evening class. She has not noted any other side effects other than the tiredness, but she is a college student that&#39;s known to have low iron, was on her period, that just went through a trauma event that probably would have jumped her adrenaline, and she was giving some liquid Benadryl. I&#39;m sure any one of those could keep the fatigue.  There was a call put into the doctor but she&#39;s procrastinating on getting back to them. No rash or difficulty breathing was noticed.

She was on the ground and we got her leaning up against the wall sitting down.  She said she was not feeling well before she fainted (did not report to staff) and then she did not remember passing out.  She felt nauseous and hot/clammy afterwards.

She was already seated for observation following the dose.  An Epi-Pen and ammonia inhalants were removed from the emergency kit  for possible use.  Pt stated she  was not having difficulty  breathing and no closing of her throat.  The ammonia inhalant helped the patient focus and she stated that it made her feel better.  Pharmacy staff called 911 and the EMS crew arrived in approximately 5 minutes.  They evaluated the patient and transported her to the local emergency room.  A couple of hours later the patient called and said she had been discharged and was doing well.  While in the emergency room she broke  out in hives and was given epinephrine and benadryl per her conversation.  Later her father came to the pharmacy and confirmed the same. She will see her primary care doctor on Monday.

                                                Patient was given her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Patient had stated that she had felt lightheaded when she was given 4 vaccines at one time in the past. We advised patient to remain seated for 15 minutes for monitoring. Patient felt more comfortable standing next to her seated sister, who had also received the vaccine. The sister said the patient had told her she started feeling lightheaded and walked over to sit down on the other chair. Once seated, per the sister, the patient slumped to the floor and started shaking. At this point, we were alerted, but after a few seconds, the shaking had stopped and the patient was fully alert. The patient was unaware of what had happened. We called 911 and paramedics came to assess the patient. The patient remained seated on the ground until paramedics arrived. The paramedics assessed her vitals and everything was normal. The paramedics were comfortable with the patient going home with her sister, but upon standing up, the patient felt lightheaded again. At this point, the paramedics thought it would be best for the patient to be monitored at the hospital. The patient agreed to be taken to for further monitoring.

                                                About roughly two weeks after receiving this vaccine I had a migraine. I had never had a migraine before so I went to urgent care, where they told me it would probably go away in a couple of days. It didn&#39;t, and I was having a whole horde of visual symptoms (floaters, flashing lights, photophobia, visual aura) so I went to Mass Eye and Ear ER about a week later. They did an examination of my eyes and told me it was all okay, and most likely due to a migraine. I assumed it would go away once more, but never did, with the symptoms continuing to become more frequent/severe. While the actual migraine part (head hurting to specify) would come and go, my visual symptoms never subsided. And despite MEE saying my vision was actually 20/15, so I could still objectively see fine, it was just not normal. I started to have vertigo, and more visual auras (a plain green line in my vision for a couple of minutes), and with these symptoms going on for about two weeks at this point, I went to an urgent care appointment at MGH, through my doctor. They administered some migraine medication (sumatriptan and zofran), but my visual symptoms did not improve. I was then sent to MGH er. They tested me for a whole myriad of things, as well as administering an MRI/MRA of the brain, and MRI of the spine, as well as performing a spinal tap, none of which yielded any significant findings. Many of my visual symptoms still persist, and the headache part, as well as vertigo, comes and goes. It has been almost a month since receiving the first dose and I am waiting to see if symptoms improve with the second. While it is obviously unclear as to whether this happened due to the vaccine or due to a third unknown factor, considering these symptoms developed roughly around the time you allegedly start to gain a significant immunity to COVID, and that no medical professionals have been able to find a clear reason for them, I feel as though it is possible and likely. (Also, I had previously had COVID, testing positive Jan 18th 2021, if that&#39;s of any relevance).

                                                Pt said that in the past she has fainted in the past with other vaccines. Pt was also currently fasting which probably contributed to the episode. Patient was given vaccine and felt fine immediately afterwards, she sat in our immunization room for a few minutes before standing. She then walked to our &#34;waiting area&#34; and sat down. About 5 minutes after, she said she felt dizzy and asked for water. We asked her to sit and would bring her water. Pharmacist (reporter for VAERS) brought water out to her and she fainted in her presence. Pharmacist kept patient upright to prevent her from sliding to the floor. Patient said she has lost vision (was just a bright light). By this point the paramedics have already been called. Patient was feeling much better by the time paramedics came, but they still wanted to check her out to make sure everything was ok. Patient had a long drive back home so not sure what the outcome was.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

Asked if it was done without realizing vaccine was complete. Pt was sturdy upon standing and said she felt well. She made it to the chair in the designated area in front of the pharmacy. Approximately 3-5 minutes later patient raised her arm to get the attention of the staff. Said she felt funny. Vaccinating pharmacist went out to determine what was wrong. Patient said she felt faint and dizzy as well as felt nauseous. Patient spit up clear saliva inbetween dry heaving. We were able to give her paper towels and some water after her episode of spitting up. Approximately 5 to 7 minutes later she said she felt better but still had some faintness and a tingling sensation in her arms and fingers. Had patient stay for 20 minutes after she said she was feeling better. No more shaking, nausea, or faintness. She felt her normal self after the 20 minutes and her mother was with her to drive her home. Explained to patient that VAERS report would be submitted.

Within 10 minutes, my face had swollen up, my eyes were swollen and red, and my hands, feet and chest had hives.   Paramedics were called and arrived 5 minutes later. At this time I was barely able to walk, was still vomiting and having diarrhea, and was shaking. They put me in the ambulance and took me to a 24hr emergency clinic.   In the ambulance, I was given saline, epinephrine, Benadryl and nausea meds. I stayed under observation until 3 am. I was released to go home at that time. Since then I have only experienced weakness and nausea.

Patient then lost all bodily control, almost felt off vaccination chair. Patient appears pale and lost consciousness. Patient was then slowly helped to the ground then all of a sudden patient started to have involuntary muscular twitching almost like she was having a seizure. Immediately I asked to call for paramedic. A waiting patient, who is a law enforcement officer assisted to help patient the floor. Then unpredictably patient sat quickly up and regained consciousness and appeared confused like she had no memory what had just happen. Paramedics did not come as patient had quickly felt better and was able to communicate proficiently. Her breathing was normal. No dizziness reported after. Patient was moved to waiting area and sat down in chair and I took her blood pressure. Blood pressure was normal 112/72. Requested patient to wait for a total of 30 minutes for monitoring. Blood pressure retaken after 10 minutes normal again . Patient was able to walk away by herself without assistance.  I gave patient a call for a well being check at 3pm today and patient insisted she feels normal. Encourage patient to be evaluated by her primary care provider.

Pharmacist, reached patient first followed by pharmacist.  Patient was visualized on the ground with eyes open. Visualized the patient&#39;s neck bent backwards and muscles rigid including neck and arms.  Went to get cold compress while stayed with the patient.  At the same time, 911 was contacted by the pharmacy staff and a fire fighter in the pharmacy area was brought over to assist. Assisted the patient to a sitting position and noticed her pupils to be dilated. Returned with cold compress for neck and forehead. Went to get cold water while comforted the patient.  Fire fighters present took the patient&#39;s vitals and blood sugar and all was within normal limits.  Further questions with the patient found that she had not eaten breakfast or lunch that day.  She also indicated that she had passed out before at a concert while dehydrated in the past.  She had not passed out or reacted to any previous injections or vaccines.

                                                I got my depo shot a week and a day after I got my 2nd dose of the vaccine. Shortly after I was driving home and I felt like there was an elephant sitting on my chest. I couldn?t get my air in I was freaking out. I drove home  and was so weak walking into my house I thought I was going to pass out. I told my mom I think I need to go to the hospital. I sat down. Ate some food and tried to relax. It eventually went away and I started getting ready to go to school. Just as I was getting ready to leave I got a huge migraine and started feeling really shakey. That?s when I decided to go to the doctors. They made me take some bloodwork, EKG, X-ray. They suspected from my white blood count that I might have a blood clot so they ordered an emergency cat scan. I got one done and they told me no blood clot. Then today I came in for more bloodwork and they told me that some of my waves from my EKG were slightly abnormal which meant I wasn?t getting enough oxygen into my heart. They want me to take an echo which in that they put me out and shove a scope down my throat and look at my heart. They think it was a reaction from taking my depo so soon after my covid vaccine.

                                                Upon reviewing the patient questionnaire with the patient she indicated that she has fainted with past immunizations about &#34;2yrs ago&#34;.   The patient indicated that she has had vaccinations since then and tattoo&#39;s without incident.  After administering the Covid-19 vaccination, the patient stated she felt fine and didn&#39;t feel like there would be any problem.  I escorted the patient to the post vaccination area for the 15 minute recovery time.   After a few minutes I checked on the patient and she looked fine without signs or symptoms (pale face) of possibly going to faint.  After a few more minutes I heard the patient fall out of her chair.  Upon reaching patient she was laying on the ground and was still out.  After about 5 seconds she awoke and was aware where she was and that she had just received a vaccination.  She stated she felt fine and after about 5 minutes we had the patient sit up when she felt comfortable.  In the mean while a &#39;Code White&#39; was called and store management had arrived.  After about another 5 minutes and when the patient was comfortable we had her sit upon a chair.  Patient had a very minor bump on her fore-head but was not bleeding.  Patient stated she felt fine but I had the patient remain in the post vaccination area for 45 minutes just to make sure.  The whole time the patient waited she was accompanied with store management.  After 45 minutes I assessed the patient.  The bump on her head looked the same and the patient indicated she felt fine, so I released her to go.

She was feeling dizzy, so immediately sat on the ground before fainting. Another patient yelled for help, and I immediately ran out to her aid. I also had one of my staff members call 911. The patient regained consciousness as I arrived, and was able to talk to me. I determined that this was a syncope reaction, and not an allergic or anaphylactic reaction. I elevated her legs, and waited for the ambulance to arrive. The EMTs analyzed her, and released her to go home with her parent.

Our technician and pharmacist caught patient and lowered her to the ground as she was fainting (nothing hit the ground uncontrolled).  Patient never lost full consciousness.

She waited 15 additional minutes before leaving the pharmacy area. She reported she was feeling completely fine.

Pharmacist stayed with the patient until EMS arrived, EMS took over care and took the patient to a local hospital for evaluation.

                                                My fever was through the roof. My body ached so bad I couldn?t walk. I was on fire all over. Then came the adverse event- uncontrollable shaking. This was not a side effect written on the moderna sheet of risks. I was shaking so bad I thought I may have a seizure. I finally settled down and fell asleep. About an hour later, I woke up shaking out of control. I was going to call 911 but my partner was able to grab some NyQuil for me and knocked me out. It was the most terrifying experience of my life and I will not be getting the second shot because of it.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

                                                Patient came to receive dose 2 of Covid19 Moderna vaccine. States 1 hour after the first dose (administered on  12/28/20) she was at work and her blood pressure dropped, she became dizzy and her face went white. She said her mother insisted she go to the ER to be examined. She states upon examination she was given fluids and tests were ran and the ER staff said she was fine. Explained this to physician at vaccine site and she said it was not a contraindication to receive 2nd dose and it sounds like possible vasovagal reaction or hypoglycemia. Patient states she still wanted to receive vaccine.  Was instructed to monitor patient for 30 minutes after vaccination,  assist patient in ambulation to waiting area to lower fall risk and provided patient with apple juice and trail mix in case of possible hypoglycemia.  About 5-10 minutes after vaccine, patient stated she became dizzy and was dry heaving. She was assisted to supine position; vitals were taken and blood pressure was slightly elevated. 911 was called. Before arrival of EMS, patient stated she was feeling better and vital signs stable. Patient was helped to ambulate around waiting area and upon arrival of EMS, patient states she did not need to be transported. Patient was observed for about 20-25 more minutes and she was fully recovered. Spoke with Dr who was on scene after the incident and she believes it was anxiety.

The symptoms started a few hours after I received the vaccine and got significantly worse the next morning. I had to call out of work because I physically felt that my knees would give out when I was standing. I also could not rest my wrists on anything because it caused too much pain. The next day, I felt much better and was able to go to work.

Around 7pm i felt dizzy and chilly, at 1am i threw up and had very bad chills and was still sore, at 7am the next morning i realized my vaccine site was swollen and bruised and felt like a large lump, the skin was rough and very hot to the touch. over the next day i had rolling headaches and nausea and it was difficult to move without pain in my extremities, this started to lessen over the next days but my arm is still swollen, hot, lumped, and painful.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I became extremely dizzy, nauseous, my lips went numb, shortness of breath, weakness, slow reaction times, the inability to operate at my normal speed in thought and action, and I became very lethargic.  I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

Additional post-vaccine screening: patient was observed for a total of 45 minutes, she had no further sxs and was d/c to home with instructions to contact ER or UC if sxs should return, worsen. Ok to receive the second dose of vaccine in one month.

                                                Following the vaccine, I was perfectly fine and was able to go about my day as normal. However, while doing dishes at 11:30 at night (about 10 hours after I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine) exhaustion and dizziness suddenly hit me, and my vaccine went black and my ears started ringing. I managed to lie down but I fainted and blacked out for a minute. After I regained consciousness, I had these muscle contractions/shivers (although I took my temperature and had no fever). I felt really exhausted, and went to sleep after that. However, other than that I had no other vaccine side effects. I was told by my doctor to report this though since they had not heard of anyone else fainting, and I have no history of fainting (other than once following blood donation). I also was not thinking about anything remotely related to the vaccine at the time of fainting, and I had no qualms with being vaccinated so I highly doubt it was psychological, especially considering I have no history of fainting, and I had an injectable medication so I have no issues with injections.

                                                Fever started at 11:30pm 4/6/2021. Fever ~100 degrees F. Had chills and couldn&#39;t get warm, then was hot and drenched in sweat. Repeated all throughout the night (Hot/cold). Took 500mg Tylenol at 12am that night. Woke up at 2am with a ~102.4 F fever. Took another Tylenol. Got out of bed around 8am 4/7 drenched in sweat. Felt nauseous and vomited almost right away and couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. Still had around 102 F so took 2 more Tylenols. Throughout that night and until Friday, I was achy all over my body. Also, lymph node under left arm pit was swollen and was sore along with my left arm. Throughout the day on 4/7, laid in bed trying to get rest and too nauseous to eat anything other than some cereal in the morning and plain noodles later in the day. Took another Tylenol in the afternoon because I was still staying at 102 F fever. Was slightly dizzy when standing up or moving too fast. I slept the next night and felt fine 4/8 morning (no fever), but felt worse as the day went on, aching everywhere and feeling more and more dizzy. Friday 4/9, I woke up in the morning and when I first started walking, I fell on the floor because of extreme dizziness. The whole day I was extremely dizzy and I&#39;ve never had vertigo before, but it seemed like that based on explanations of it. Also had painful headache every time I stood up, but was fine when I wasn&#39;t moving. The next day it was mild dizziness and completely gone the day after that.  Also, Thursday 4/8 around 7:30pm, I noticed I had hives on the back of my right hand. Not 100% sure if it&#39;s due to the vaccine, but I&#39;m not sure what else would have caused it and it&#39;s worth noting. It was gone the next day.

                                                Patient felt faint 10 min after receiving vaccination. She said she felt as though she had been hit by a truck and was very hot. She was sat down and feet propped up. Cold compress was placed on the back of her neck. She stated that she had not eaten anything today so we gave her something to drink in case her sugar was low. After a few minutes she stated her throat felt strange. I asked her if she felt like it was tightening  or lips or tongue swelling or issues with breathing. She stated she didn&#39;t know about the throat other than it felt strange. I gave her 25mg of Benadryl after getting permission from her just in case an allergic reaction was starting. She stated soon after that her throat was getting better. She sat for about 45 minutes in our immunization room until she felt better. She was no longer hot and feeling bad when leaving.

                                                When checking out after the 15 minute wait time, patient said she didn&#39;t feel very well and fell down hitting her head on the pharmacy counter.  When she came to, she said she felt &#34;weird&#34;,  lightheaded and clammy.  We offered her a drink of water and before she could take a drink, she passed out cold. She was out for about 20 seconds and then came to again and we took her down to 1 layer on top and gave her a bag of ice while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.  She was treated/observed by the ambulance crew and after another 15 minutes, agreed she was good to go home with her 2 friends that she had ridden with to get her vaccine.

                                                Around 11:00 in the morning I was starting to feel weak and hard of breathing with a sore arm where the injection site was. As the day went on it progressed to muscle aches and a low fever, I went to bed with chills, muscle pain, heavy breathing, and a 100.8 fever. I work up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and felt nauseous, I don?t remember much but I remember waking up on the floor in a cold sweat, so I assume I passed out from the nausea. I went back to bed and I woke up with a 101.8 fever and weakness and muscle pains. My mother told me to take Tylenol every 4 hours and be on top of things, my symptoms have been decreasing since this morning but as I am filling this out at 11:00 at night I?m slowly getting my fever back. I will add this is exactly how I felt when I got covid back in November of 2020.

                                                I received my shot around 8:30 in the morning and started feeling side effects around 10 pm. I felt a little bit fatigued and my left arm was extremely sore to the point where I could barely move it. The next day, it was still sore but I was able to move it much more. I had muscle aches through my entire body. It is now 2 days after the day I got the vaccine and my arm is still sore and hurt when I extend my arm.

                                                After first vaccine: History: Moderna COVID vaccine on 3/11/2021. Arm soreness over the first day or two but nothing else that really struck her. A few days after she started to notice axillary pain that progressed up her right neck and down to her right hand. She saw a physician who thought she was having nerve pain brought on by the vaccine. Around the 18th she started to feel a snapping pain in her wrist. Went to ED on the 20th because she started to have arm shaking, she was given ativan, her arm shaking stopped and they discharged her home. That evening her fingers felt clenched. On the 21st she woke up in the morning, went to urinate and dropped to the floor because her legs felt like jello and felt like they kept giving out. They initially thought the ativan was just making her feel out of it. They waited until the evening but then needed to go to the ED. The concern was GBS and transverse myelitis. They ate dinner and decided to drive to ED, on the drive she was kind of falling asleep periodically. Then she suddenly couldn&#39;t lift her water bottle. She started to be completely out of it, Mom says she wasn&#39;t responding. Pt says that she felt like she knew what was going on, felt a little out of body and wasn&#39;t quite responding. Mom couldn&#39;t get her out of the car, she was carried into the ED and at that point she started to recover a little bit more. About 10 minutes later she started to feel better. She was admitted because she was still having trouble walking. In the hospital she had a normal CT head and video EEG but she didn&#39;t have any events while on the monitor. Discharged home the following day with the diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder and instructions to establish care with an adult PCP. They advised considering CBT as well.  Since discharge her legs feels tired, going up the stairs feels much harder than it should. She has not had any falls and no longer feels like she is going to fall.  She follows with a therapist, has had dissociative episodes and panic attacks in the past.   Assessment:  20 YOF with PMH of panic attack, POTS, IDA and benign heart murmur who developed weakness of b/l LE and altered consciousness approximately 10 days after her first dose of Moderna COVID vaccine. Also had an episode of unilateral arm shaking the day prior that resolved with ativan in the ED. At this point unclear if directly related to vaccination. Differential includes mild Guillain-Barre 2/2 previous infection or vaccination, stress reaction/anxiety, POTS complication, myasthenia gravis, tick bite, infection, heavy metal poisoning, B12 deficiency, seizure disorder, atypical migraine. Functional Neurologic Disorder diagnosed by neurology after overnight admission  for video EEG which captured no events. CT head  also WNL per neurology discharge summary. Neurologic exam today WNL.   After Second Vaccine: History: She had her 2nd vaccine on 4/15 (6 days ago). Had vaccine in right arm again, she did have some arm pain again. She had coffee without breakfast in the morning. Had finished her first virtual class, went to the restroom during her second class, felt strangely in the restroom, went back to her room. She then passed out. Her fall was unwitnessed. She called to her roommate when she came to but her roommate hadn&#39;t heard the fall. She thinks she was only out for a few seconds but cannot be sure. Called her Mom who advised her to eat something so she ate an orange sitting on the floor. She got up to make herself breakfast and she passed out again. Again unwitnessed but patient thinks it was very fast. She crawled over to the couch, sat on the couch for for 15 minutes then felt fine for the rest of the day. She did not feel nauseous at all. She denies palpitations, difficulty breathing and chest pain.  Today in office after orthostatics and blood draw she fainted again, only out for seconds. BP elevated immediately after the event but WNL minutes later.  These syncopal episodes reminded her of her syncopal episodes with IDA and POTS. They do not feel like the episode after the first vaccine when she lost feeling in her legs and was very out of it.  She feels like her arm pain from the first vaccine never fully resolved. After the arm pain worsened from the 2nd shot she tried a 3 day course of aleve to see if that helped things. At this point it is mostly just her right wrist that is painful. Overall feels more localized to wrist than prior. She has since stopped the aleve, last was last night. She has not noticed redness or swelling in wrist or arm.  LMP was 4/2-4/6. She went almost a year without menses so stopped her OCP, but her menses have returned recently and she has restarted OCP.  Assessment: Right arm pain persisted from the first vaccination but otherwise sx had resolved. She got 2nd vaccination on 4/15, only arm pain but yesterday had 2 brief syncopal events and one today in the office. Orthostatic BPs not completely convincing for orthostatic hypotension today.

Also had high fever (reaching 103.8) for four days (starting two days after vaccination) which was reported, and a rash of purple spots across my chest, arms, and back started after fever stopped. Rash was not very bothersome, but alarming. Experienced frequent nausea and lightheadedness, but I also was experiencing those symptoms at the time due to my concussion. One week exactly after vaccination all symptoms were gone and no treatment was needed.

                                                Approximately ten hours after injection, woke up with constant chills, fever of 100.1, body aches, stuffed nose (had to breathe out of mouth), and headache. Acetaminophen helped slightly. For the next 12 hours fever stayed between 101 and 102 despite continuing to take acetaminophen, and headache also didn&#39;t improve. At 6:15 pm that day (~29 hours post-shot) fever was 103.2, headache was very strong (with light sensitivity). Since acetaminophen hadn&#39;t been helping, switched to ibuprofen. About an hour later, the fever finally began to go down and was gone by 10 pm that night. The next day, no fever and minimal headache, but was very weak and lightheaded. At about 51 hours after the shot, symptoms were all gone.

Her boyfriend who was also there for an immunization and I were able to catch her before she fell, she was brought to floor in sitting position and I recommended she lie down, she was very pale but still coherent. We called store assistant manager who came to assist and he called paramedics to check her out. I stayed with her until paramedics came, they checked her out and determined she was ok and did not need further assistance. She was driven home by boyfriend once she was given the all clear and we all determined she was ok. Patient appeared to have a fear of needles. We called patient later in evening to check on her and she said she was doing fine.

                                                Patient was sitting in observation after receiving first dose of Moderna and within 5 minutes began to feel dizzy and visual disturbances.  We gave the patient some bottled water and ice pack and she started to feel better, but ultimately her mother wanted me to call EMS. Ems instructed no food or drink until they got there.  The EMS took her blood pressure which was in the 80s/50s.  The patient said she was feeling better but was fearful of another dizzy spell and wanted to go with EMS out of an abundance of caution.  From the time she received the vaccine to the time she left with EMS it was no more than 30 minutes.

She was accompanied by her mother, shortly in to her 15 minute waiting period her mother approached and said the patient felt light headed. I asked patient to remove her mask and assessed for any swelling of the lips or the face. Patient stated she did not have any issues breathing but felt very faint. Her eyes were very dilated, and she wanted to lay down. So we assisted patient to the floor, called Code White and 911. I stayed with patient as she lay down, she began to recover, but still looked very pale. I continually assessed patient for anaphylaxis, but patient reported no pain in injection site or issues breathing. Paramedics arrived and assessed patient,  BP was normal, blood sugar was in the low normal range, paramedics determined that issue was not related to vaccine, but that she was dehydrated and had not eaten, which exacerbated the light headedness.

We placed an instant cold compress on her neck and she held one to her forehead, and rested her head between her knees.  We also placed a fan in the area to circulate the air.  She said she was nervous because she had an appt at another pharmacy during her lunch hour and they couldnt give her the scheduled dose so she was driving all over town to find a dose in 100 degree heat before her lunch hour was over.  She also stated she had a &#39;rough time&#39; after her first dose and was concerned about the second.  We had her call someone to pick her up and drive her home- she was feeling better by the time they arrived (approximately one hour).  She believed her reaction was primarily due to anxiety

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

                                                I got up to use the bathroom at 4:30 this morning. I was extremely shaky but made it. I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

She was breathing rapidly. She whispered that she was scared. I told her to take deep breaths to try and calm her. I asked if she felt hurt or if she has any trouble breathing. After about 3-5 minutes of lying on their ground, she became more alert and asked me if she fell from her chair. She didn&#39;t recall falling or that she said she was scared. I had her sit up and asked how she felt and if she had any symptoms of an allergic reaction--she said no. after another minute or 2, she was able to stand up on her own with no lightheadedness nor dizziness. I walked alongside her to another seat and she sat for another 25 to 30 minutes--she said she was completely fine before leaving with her sister

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/10/21 and had a large, red, inflamed area on her arm at the injection site for a few days, but otherwise tolerated vaccine well. She received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/10/21 and the next day (3/11/21) developed fatigue and lightheadedness while exercising, which continued for the next few days. She developed acute onset, sharp chest pain on 3/13/21 AM which did not resolve so she presented to an ED. Vitals were normal but labs notable for troponin I which peaked at 4.36, CK 758, d-dimer 640. CBC/CMP and EKG were unremarkable and initial TTE with EF ~45%. Repeat TTE obtained a few days later with normal LV and RV size/function without any wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac MRI obtained with normal LV function (EF 64%) but late gadolinium enhancement in a subepicardial distribution within the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle at the base most compatible with myocarditis. ESR and CRP were normal. Further workup to determine etiology of myocarditis was negative (ANA, ANCA, RF, hepatitis panel, HIV, full respiratory viral panel, COVID-19 PCR). She was placed on metoprolol succinate 12.5mg XL daily and will follow up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. Family concerned that COVID-19 vaccine was the trigger/underlying etiology of her myocarditis.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the event, I had throat swelling, chills, sweats, temperature of 102.5, headache, muscle soreness, dizziness, lightheadedness. Onset was over the course of about 1 hour. I had previously taken part in the double-blinded Astrazeneca in COVID-19 trials (meaning I did not know I was vaccinated) in November 2019, so the nurse told me that the response could really be from anything: partly due to some interaction between the vaccines, allergy, and/or already producing antibodies. I was unblinded and told I was given the Astrazeneca vaccine. Interestingly, I had none of these responses to just the Astrazeneca vaccines, just a bit of soreness after the first one. I have never had such a strong response, and I believe this is the highest my temperature has ever been, and my lymph nodes are still swollen. I am much better now; however, even last night and this morning, I was feeling unwell.

Pt  was able to whisper and acknowledge me.  She was oriented to person and place.  Her pupils were constricted, but was lying in the sunshine.  EMS had already called for ambulance.  I talked with Pt to obtain any medications, history and allergies - to which she denied all.  She then began to tremor with her eyes rolling into her head, unresponsive during this episode.  After about 20 seconds, she focused on me and was able to respond to some direction.  By that time ambulance was present. She was lifted by 6 people and placed onto stretcher.   Stretcher placed into ambulance and went to hospital

                                                Vomiting and kinda almost fainted. After vomiting I was fine. Lasted roughly 5-10 min. Feeling faint could have been cause by over panicking about vomiting and the vaccine but I though I would share.

                                                I got my injection about 6 hours later my arm started to feel completely broken from shoulder to fingers. I could not move it without intense pain for a few days. Then pain followed off and on that felt like I hit my funny-bone perpetually. 5 weeks later, the pain became so bad that I went to the ER for treatment. I also had an x-ray done earlier in the week for it at an orthopedic clinic who told me the injection was injected too high and into my bursa. They scribed PT. But when in ER, My arm started to go completely numb. I then received steroids to take 5 days orally. The pain has gotten a little better but I have limited movement without feeling nerve pain all down my arm into my fingertips.

                                                Around 10 min after injection patient flagged down a technician and said she thought she was going to faint. Fainting has happened to her in the past and she could feel it coming on. The pharmacist moved her closer to the area and gave her water. While pharmacist was standing with her she lost consciousness and control of her bladder. Pharmacist held patient upright as she was still in the chair as to not obstruct breathing. Patient was out for around a min and regained consciousness. Pharmacist in that time had called EMS who arrived later and checked all vitals. Patient drove alone nearly an hour so Pharmacist want to make sure she was ok before driving the long distance home.

                                                Patient came in forher first dose of the Moderan vaccine.  Patient is an overnight associate.  We processed her paperwork, I asked her if she felt ok (answered the questions she had fiklled out) and then I proceeded to have her sit in the booth.  When I went into the booth, I explained to her when her second dose was and to bring back her vaccine card.  She stated she did not really want to get the shot, but was being pressured by her mom.  I asked her if she was sure she wanted the shot, and she said yes because her dad has a heart condition.  I then proceeded to administer the shot at 8:12 am.  She did very well with the shot- no bleeding in the bandaid. I asked her to sit for about 10 minutes.  I proceeded to walk back into the pharmacy, and I dispoded of the gloves.  I then walked over to my computer, then I heard the loud thump at 8:14 am.  I immedietly ran out to the booth and she had fallen over.  We called a code white and called 911.  Pt was awake, hit her head and mouth. I asked her if she had eaten and she said she could not remember,  She said the shot was fine and she was on her phone and that is all she remembers.  I rubber her back and chatted with her until the fire department arrived.  She was able to call her cousin from her phone, but I did not move her until the fire department came.  EMS came and she went with them. EMS stated that she had not slept in 24 hours and  that could be the cause.  The time from the shot to the thump was no more than 1 minute.

The paramedics arrived and evaluated her and a ride was called so she would not have to drive. She waiting in the pharmacy for around 40-45mins after the vaccination before leaving with her parents.

                                                At 10:40, the patient went in for her first Moderna vax.  She was slightly nervous since she&#39;s not a fan of needles. When she got it a vessel must have been nicked, because she experienced a bit of blood streaming down her arm which surprised us. The nurse wasn&#39;t concerned and stopped it quickly and cleaned up her arm.  Got her a new bandaid and she was sent to the chairs in the waiting area to wait her 15 minutes following the vax.    I had to pick up my regular prescription so I got in line while she was sitting there surfing on her phone.  As I got to the front of the line, the patient called me and said she was feeling lightheaded. I immediately left the line, and was there (I was maybe 15 feet away) and was asking how she felt. She said she felt sweaty and like she might pass out.  Right then, her eyes rolled a bit and closed and she went limp. I was able to hold on to her and a customer that was behind me in line and I were able to alert the nurse that gave the vax and the pharmacist. Both immediately came to our aid.  We got the patient on the floor and on her side.  The nurse wanted us to have an epi pen in case, but we all didn&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction. We checked her blood pressure and it was low.  Another employee was already calling an ambulance and another was getting her some juice. She was beginning to regain consciousness. She was only out for about 2 to 3 minutes at the most.  Her blood pressure was low, but started to come back to normal pretty quickly.  We had her lay there a few minutes and then sit up. Eventually we moved her to the chair a few minutes later.  Within another few minutes the emts arrived. She had already had answered questions for us like her name, birthday, where she was, etc.  The emts repeated those same questions, asked us what happened and rechecked her vitals.  All were back to normal.  They gave her the option of be transported to the ER, but given that she was feeling back to normal she declined and everybody felt good about that decision.

                                                Patient was in the post-vaccination area seated after her shot.  About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she stated that she started feeling lightheaded.  She fainted and fell out of her chair.  I  immediately went to her and found her conscious, but very disoriented.  She stated that she felt nauseated.  911 had been called;  I stayed with her until they arrived.  They fitted her with a cervical counter and raised her to  a seated position and took her vitals.  She was able to stand and get on the stretcher with their assistance.  The EMTs stayed with her and monitored her  vitals until her mother arrived to take her home.  I spoke with her by phone at 6PM.   She stated that she felt fine  now (except for a bump on her head).  She stated that she was afraid of needles and that anxiety probably caused the incident.

                                                Patient told rph that she can faint when getting vaccination.  Pharmacist vaccinated and patient immediately began to feel dizzy and started shaking.  She did not pass out or fall out of her chair.  It was conveyed by the pharmacist to the technician staff that the patient was having difficulty breathing.  911 was called. 2nd pharmacist went into room to assess and pt was breathing fine.  She asked for some water and a bag of ice which were both given to patient. Paramedics arrived and took patient vitals.  Patient refused and further care and a relative came to pick her up.  Paramedics advised patient to follow up with further care if warranted.  When patient left she was feeling better.

Some heaviness in her chest  which progressed over next 10 minutes to feeling difficulty breathing - &#34;like a rock on her chest&#34; . At 09:04 AM She used her Albuterol asthma inhaler to see if it would help her breathing. No improvement in breathing, then complained at 0911 of some vision changes, felt like she was having to concentrate to breath - like breathing through a straw and at this time I started to hear her audibly wheezing - Squad was called. When they arrived around 9:18 AM she was having heaviness, closed her eyes - complaining of a little bit light headed, still having difficulty breathing.  She left with squad at 9:24 AM

I instantly felt like I was going to faint and also broke out in a sweat with my heart racing.

I started to get warm and felt like I was about to vomit so I washed my face with cool water. I went to sit down and my vision started to blur and my vision started to close in with darkness and I passed out. When I gained consciousness again, I was still extremely dizzy and light-headed and my vision was still not focused. I passed out two more times. When I gained consciousness the final time, I was extremely sweaty and shaky. I called 911 and they sent paramedics to my house. I drank some water and stayed in the floor until they arrived. They took me by ambulance to the hospital to run several tests and everything looked normal.

Every single muscle and joint in my body hurt, it felt like I had been hit by a train. I could feel soreness down to the muscles in my hands. I could barely move, I couldn?t get comfortable. My head and neck hurt the worst, it was just so sore and painful and everytime I stood up, I would get a pounding sensation in my head. It went on like that for almost 12 hours. The next day I felt perfectly fine.

                                                Two days after receiving vaccine, began with bilateral knee pain and stiffness, shortly followed by rash over both legs. Over the next few hours, the rash became more prominent, and pain in knees, ankle and shins made walking difficult. Went to ER and was diagnosed with  Henoch-Schonlein purpura and told to take Ibuprofen for pain and to follow up with PCP. Rash continued to spread over the next two days to include both upper arms and elbows, with broken blood vessels. Also developed swelling in knees and more severely in ankles.  CBC with differential in ER was reported as normal. Visited PCP 5/23/21, who referred to dermatologist and completed urinalysis which was essentially normal with possible elevated white cells to be cultured.

She appears to have had a petit mal seizure. Her pupils were very dilated and it took her several minutes to become fully responsive, although she was unresponsive for just a short period of time. She is a student and the EMS staff who responded to the 911 call reports that she is well known to them, as she has a history of &#34;pseudo-seizures&#34;.  Patient&#39;s BP was 138/84 and SPO2 was 98%. Pt was transported to ED around noon, and was back to the clinic by 1:15 to collect her eyeglasses that had been left where she was sitting.

She was barely responsive and talking very faintly- NO difficulty breathing or any symptoms of allergic reaction. Had a staff member call 911. After a few minutes she threw up and then she was able to communicate a little more than earlier.

The paramedics arrived soon after, briefed them the sequence of events. She was doing well by then. F/u with a call to patient at around 4pm-all ok she said.

                                                Sharp stabbing chest pain causes difficulty breathing. Fast heart beat causes me to faint. Unable to move till the pain passes through (around 20 minutes). Painful periods started on June 11, 2021 during the middle of the night around 3:00am when i was woken up by the ability unable to breathe due to chest pain and unable to move till the pain passed through. Then again on June 13, 2021 while i was watching t.v. around 9pm. I had difficulty breathing and had to focus on my heart beat to slow down. However, i am constantly out of breathe and easily fatigued.

                                                1 week after receiving the vaccine, I began having vocal and physical tics. I have never been diagnosed with a tic disorder in the past but had had physical tics every few months prior to vaccine. After the vaccine they became very frequent and, 2 weeks post vaccine, were occuring about once every minute. They went away after 4 weeks post vaccine.  After second vaccine dose (04/02/2021) I began having intense fatigue, lightheadedness, and inability to stand for long periods. These have not improved as of today.  In both cases, it was a significant increase of prior symptoms I have not received proper diagnosis for.

She then said that she was feeling really dizzy and thought she was going to pass out. She turned white and said she felt very sick. She leaned back in her chair and a cold ice pack was applied to her forehead and the injection site. This continued for about 30 minutes and then colored returned to her face and lips and she said she was feeling much better.

This lasted a few hours.  1/15/21- 3:45am I got up to use bathroom and noticed I was very lightheaded. I thought maybe I just stood up too fast. I got back in bed and my arm was 8/10 pain so I also thought faintness could possibly due to pain.  7:15am I got up to go to work and quickly felt very warm and my vision started to go black. I laid back down for a few minutes until this resolved. I took my temperature and it was 99.0. I got up again and started to get ready but began feeling light headed again. I ended up getting ready while sitting down because I kept feeling too much like I was going to pass out. I ate breakfast and felt fine. 8:00am I left for work and after driving for about 5 minutes I felt myself getting very warm again and light-headed. I ended up pulling over and calling for someone to come pick me up.  9:00am My temperature was 99.5. My blood pressure laying down was 110/74 and HR was 74. After standing for 5 minutes my BP was 90/70 and my HR was 92. During this 5 minutes of standing I felt myself getting warm again but my vision did not start to go black and I was able to stand for the full 5 minutes.  At various times throughout the day I would feel faint if I was standing or sitting upright for too long. The last time I felt this was was probably 11:30pm on 1/15/21. 1/16/21 - No light-headedness or warmth. Did feel some slight chest pressure, but nothing crazy and it only lasted maybe half of the day.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

At 9:30 the next morning, I developed a fever of 100.5 and body aches. Around 2 pm, I got a headache which felt like it was because blood was hitting the veins in my head really hard- I think that&#39;s high blood pressure? My blood pressure was 126/85. I read not to take medicine because it would make the vaccine less effective, but I had to take an aspirin at 8 pm because I couldn&#39;t handle the headache any more, and ever since, I&#39;ve just had a sore arm and a headache when I walk too fast (it&#39;s been two days after the shot now).

Left after sitting for 20 minutes because I thought the &#34;anxiety&#34; would resolve best at home. Arrived home at 10:25 AM. My lips started itching, and then swelled along with my tongue. My throat felt tight and I tried to take an oral Benadryl. It got stuck in my throat and I was unable to swallow the pill. It was also difficult to swallow water. I arrived at the ED by 10:40 AM, where I was treated with IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol. I remained swollen all over, especially in my fingers, for the next 4 days. I gained 12 pounds, either from the reaction or the steroids. My airway did not fully close.

Later that night when I was going back to my room, I felt very weak and dizzy and I ended up passing out.  I don&#39;t remember anything until I woke up around 9:00 a.m. the following day.  I felt back to myself by around 4:00 p.m. January 29th, 2021.&#34;

Treatment: I was rushed to the ER and given an IV steroid, IV fluids (2 bags), and IV benadryl.   Outcome: All the reactions went away within 4 hours and I was discharged from the ER. I was advised to take benadryl for 48 hours afterwards as needed and given a 5 day course of prednisone; 2 tablets taken daily.

                                                When the person had given me the shot, it was so painful and he had kept in my arm for a while. It was nothing like the first one. He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

                                                The first couple of days I had a very sore arm and I couldn?t raise it above my stomach. That went away so I thought that it was fine, however, two days ago I looked in the mirror and I had a large red circle around the injection site. It is itchy, red, swollen, and sore. It has been over a week since I received the vaccine so I was a bit worried about it.

Symptoms would come and go throughout day, but were worse in the mornings. Wednesday (2/10) - Present (2/13) - same symptoms as Tuesday (2/9). Symptoms worse in the mornings and after physical exertion (going to school, walking stairs), and at night as well. Symptoms are not severe, but I am concerned that they have lasted a full week. I have been taking Day-Quil severe every 4 hours. I was also on my period, which just ended yesterday (2/12). I believe my period started the day of the vaccine.  I plan on going to a doctor&#39;s office, but have been too tired to move from my apartment.

I was lightheaded and nauseous for the remainder of the day. I know pain is a typical side effect, but this was unusually intense pain and I felt I should report it. I quite literally felt delirious after coming-to on the floor.

Pt prefers to wait for her dad to take her to the ER Counseled pt on risk of death due to airway cut off due to worsening sx: bronchial inflammation/throat swelling or decreased oxygen to heart/brain with dizziness (MI/stroke).

                                                The vaccine was administered to the patient in the consultation room. Once we left the consultation room, after about 2 minutes, the patient got my attention and complained of feeling dizzy. I went to her side, and she told me that she felt like she was going to pass out. The patient then proceeded to lose consciousness while sitting in a chair in the waiting area. She then exhibited seizure-like movements (muscles contracted, groaning sounds) for about 10 seconds, and she then regained consciousness. I administered no treatment, since this did not exhibit the signs of an anaphylactic reaction. 911 was called, and emergency medical services arrived. The patient was then taken to the hospital. The patient stated that she has had a similar reaction in the past to getting a vaccine, she thinks it is from the stress of getting injected with a needle.

Right arm was consistently sore and hard to lift above head. About 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, my right arm, shoulder, upper back, hand, fingers, knee, ankle, foot, and toes all began to feel tight and lose sensation. By March 12, I was walking with a limp and struggled to move my right arm at all.

                                                received her COVID Moderna 1st dose vaccine on 3/15/21 in the late afternoon. After she had her vaccine she sat down in a chair and waited out her 15 minutes. During this time she said her ears were ringing and she felt faint. We switched her chair to one with larger arms to sit. She asked for water, we provided her a bottle of water and she started to breathe heavily. Her mom was with her and also was vaccinated waiting for 15 minutes. During this time her breathing became labored and she was feeling very faint. I called 911 and EMS arrived about 10 minutes later to see how she was doing. At no point did Taylor pass out or lose consciousness. She was cleared by EMS who checked her blood pressure which was normal and she did not have labored breathing after their visit. During the EMS check they asked the last time she ate and that was at 11 am. She declined medical transport to the hospital and was able to walk out of the facility.

                                                Patient had what appeared to be a vasovagal reaction.  She complained of feeling light-headed and nauseous about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  This continued for a short time and she also began to complain of feeling chilled and was noticeably diaphoretic.  I monitored her blood pressure, which was low on the initial reading and then eventually came up to a reading of 89/60 with a pulse of 73 at the point that her symptoms began to subside.  By approximately 45 minutes after the episode began, she reported feeling better and was able to stand and walk without symptoms.  She went home at that time with a friend.

                                                At about 06:15 PM after receiving the Moderna vaccine, patient left hand (the same arm the shot was given) began to turn blue-grey. The nurses there kept her in a room for about an hour, and monitored her vital signs. Everything seemed to be normal except for the discoloration in the skin. She had trouble breathing and some lightheadedness, but it was ruled to be an anxiety response as everything looked normal. Over the time spent in the clinic, the color began to become less intensely blue and fade back to a normal skin color -- but not completely. At about 7:30 PM, she got up to walk and started feeling pins and needles in her arm and upper chest, but this may be due to anxiety.   The feeling disappeared not long after, and we were able to make it home and eat. Everything else that night went OK, except for the fact that her hand is, at the time of this report, still blue-ish in color.

Was unable to get myself out of bed until around 11AM after taking a nap. Used naproxen to bring the symptoms down to a manageable level, but despite taking 440 mg total (220 around 11am, 220 around 8pm), I was mostly bedridden throughout the day. I had very little energy, and moving too much caused dizziness. All symptoms lasted from 4AM on the day after the second dose until waking up the day after that.

When I came to, I was disoriented for about 2 minutes and very cold.  -For a week after I fainted I was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up without feeling that I was going to faint.  -The second week after my shot I also felt pressure on my chest for 5 days that has since then gone away.  -Since I fainted 3 hours after my shot  I have experienced constant ringing in both ears that have not stopped for the past 30 days since I got the vaccine. I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

                                                Patient appeared anxious prior to vaccine administration.  When asked if she felt like she was going to pass out, patient advised she did not pass out from needles/shots before, but has fainted because of extreme anxiety; but did not feel like she would pass out at this time.  After shot was administered, pt. was more relaxed, and advised she was feeling ok.  Patient was ambulatory, with no complaints of light-headedness or adverse feelings, and walked to the observation area.  Approximately five minutes following vaccination, patient told companion that she did not feel good, and laid down on the floor.  She then experienced a syncopal episode.  Patient did not hit head, or have any injury as a result of the syncopal episode.  Patient was breathing normally, but was unresponsive for approximately 15-20 seconds.  Following episode, patient regained consciousness (COAx3), and was upset from incident, but confirmed no injury or other illness, following episode.  Patient was evaluated by EMTs on site, and was able to sit up and transfer from the ground, to a chair, and the chair to a wheel chair without issue.  Further evaluation was conducted by EMT on site.  Blood pressure was 110/80, SPO2 was 98% room air, and pulse was 66 at approximately 13:22 hours.  Patient laid on gurney/cot on-site for approximately 20 minutes, to rest, and to be monitored for additional side-effects.  During monitoring, patient advised the only thing she had eaten today was &#34;one peanut butter cup.&#34;  Patient was provided water and a juice box during monitoring time.  Patient was released from monitoring area at 13:45 hours, after she advised she was feeling ok.  She was wheeled into the parking area as a precaution, and left with her companion.  Patient was the passenger of the vehicle.

                                                Around 6:30, I started feeling dizziness and got a severe headache. After waking up from a nap that night around 9, I woke up to a 101.4 fever, itchy throat, dizziness, naseau, and a swollen, red circle around my injection site that was hot to the touch. I couldn&#39;t sleep due to pain and discomfort from my arm and fever. I woke up around 4:30, vomiting. I took Advil and Hydroxizine around 8 am to sleep, but it still didn&#39;t help as I woke up every 30 minutes. I had a fever of 101.3 and these same symptoms the whole day of 4/14. Before going to bed this night, my temperature was down to 100.3. I woke up the next morning (4/15) and my temperature was down to 99.4, so I went to work. I still had the symptoms of itchy throat, dizziness, and weakness. My arm was still swollen and sore too. Another symptom I thought was interesting that I had was waking up drenched in sweat this morning (4/16) and yesterday morning (4/15).  I even woke up through the night to put a fan on me at high speed and took my blankets off, yet still woke up sweating. Tonight, my temperature is back to normal, but I still have an itchy throat, some dizziness, and an itchy injection site.

The paramedics released her to follow up with her primary care physician (which she did not list on our immunization form). I tried to call her home about 3 hours later to follow up, there was no answer

After eating a snack and drinking water symptoms improved over about 1 hour and patient returned home. Pharmacist call to check on patient the next day, she said she was feeling better, not 100%, but Ok. Since then, she had a headache for 4 days and started having mental distress (out of body feeling, memory loss, and covid-like symptoms). She also states she has had excessive sweating since a week ago and feels very unstable on her feet. She went to a doctor who tested her for covid. It came back negative. The doctor advised if the symptoms continue to get worse, she should go to the hospital. She was at work today, we discussed all these things here. She said she couldn&#39;t even remember her name or walk straight. I told her she needed to go to the hospital ASAP and not to work the rest of her shift.

                                                Patient received blood draw directly after the immunization for a blood work order.  Shortly after that she fainted while making her follow-up appointment.  She was only momentarily out and did not hit her head as she slumped forward (per the person who witnessed it, who was not me).  She remained in the clinic for observation for almost 30 minutes and given Gatorade.  She then left under her own power with no problems.

                                                Administered the first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. No apparent concerns were found when reviewing the PQCF and talking with the patient prior to administering the vaccine. Patient verbally stated she&#39;d never experienced a reaction immediately after receiving a vaccine and specifially referred to receiving flu shots annually. Vaccine was administered at 15:02, and the patient was seated in the designated &#34;Post-vaccine waiting area&#34; located directly in front of the pharmacy windows. At 15:04 patient began to feel nauseated with flacial flushing. CPhT was monitoring the patient. At 15:06, the patient began to exhibit s/s of syncope, including: facial flushing, profuse sweating, nausea, weakness, coldness of extremities, and visual disturbances. At 15:06, the patient&#39;s face/lips began to lose color while stating she was dizzy. Under her own power with aid, the patient was gently transferred from the chair to the floor and placed in the supine position with both feet propped up on the chair. She was given an ice pack and paper towels and remained on the floor for approximately 14 minutes. At 15:21, the patient stated she felt much better and wanted to try to sit up. After monitoring the patient for 34 minutes, she left the pharmacy area under her own power stating she felt much better and still plans on getting the second vaccine. Patient was counseled and questions were answered regarding this reaction.

After receiving my first dose of Moderna, I had ?covid arm? with a big red welt that then turned into a big itchy rash on the side of my left arm. After my second shot, I immediately felt dizzy, fatigued, and just generally unwell. The next morning, I developed the worst nausea, fever, chills, and diarrhea. My fever increased over the span of about 6 hours until it reached 102 degrees. After the fever broke, I still had a horrible headache but felt so much better. Unfortunately, the fever has come back on the second night post-vaccine and I am at 100 degrees again.

These spells lasted for a couple of hours but after a few days became more chronic and was matched with fatigue, tightness of chest, headaches, and brain fog.  Impaired ability to complete every day tasks. Began presenting with capilliarities in mid April, along with easy bruising/bleeding and elevated liver enzymes (the enzymes began to stabilize over the following week).

I was sweating and shaking from that, and went to the toilet and threw up a little bit. Dizziness/faintness persisted when standing until around 9 am.

I knew the fever was a possible side effect, but it got very bad very quickly. I had to call off of work because I could not stay awake and was in so much pain. My fever has lowered 2 days after vaccination, but has not fully gone down.  Also, my neck on the side that my vaccine was administered (the left arm) is very swollen and very painful. I cannot lift my arm and there is a noticeable difference between my left and my right neck in regards to swelling.

After about an hour of the symptoms intensifying, I started to get a low grade fever. I took something for the symptoms (alka seltzer daytime pill), but went to bed shortly. I started waking up off and on around 6 (I normally sleep in until noon). At 7am, I woke up feeling like I was on fire. I grabbed my thermometer from my nightstand- it read 104 degrees Fahrenheit. I tried to open my medicine but I was so weak I couldn?t do it myself. I walked downstairs and woke my mom up. She took my temperature and it read 103 since I was no longer in my bed warmed by my body heat. She opened my nighttime alka seltzer and gave it to me along with 800 mg ibuprofen. I went to bed with nothing but a sheet and a cooling pillow. At some point my mom came in and handed me my water but I don?t remember it, however it helped cool me down when I fell asleep with it in my bed. When I woke up at 11, my fever was only 100 and it was the only symptom I had. When I got out of bed at 1, I was fever free. I?ve been fatigued the rest of the day but the fever hasn?t returned and I?ve been taking 325 acetaminophen every 4 hrs.

Symptoms included redness and soreness at the site of injection and swollen lymph nodes in the armpit of the arm where the shot was injected. 12 hours after receiving the second dose I was shaking, nauseated, dizzy, sweating one minute and freezing the next, pain all over the body, my breathing slowed down and lastly there was a loud deafening ringing in my ears. These symptoms lasted a frightening 10 or so minutes leaving behind the bodily aches.

Patient stated she felt dizzy about 10 minutes into wait time following immunization.  I gave her a bottle of water, we talked with her about her symptoms, gave her wet towels as cool compress and called the person who was accompanying her, who was shopping in store.

My Primary Dr. told me to take Benadryl and to keep him abreast if any other symptoms started to appear. I don&#39;t do well with needles and became really light-headed (Fire Dept. took me into another room and provided me with water while allowing me to sit there for a while until I was better). Every now and then I randomly breakout randomly with rashes that appear where the rash was before on my arm, chest, and back when I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine.

She was advised to sit for her entire 15 minute observation period which she did. After 15 minutes, she went to the front store where I&#39;m told she passed out twice, hitting her head at least one of those times. By the time I was alerted, she was responsive. I tried to keep her laying down, but she sat up and began vomiting. I was unable to get a BP reading before EMS arrived.

                                                Around 7pm that night I started to have a clenching feeling in my chest. I didnt have any trouble breathing and that feeling lasted through the night. I felt kind of flushed and tried and dizzy. Then the dizziness got a lot worse the next day. I was extremely dizzy to the point where I couldn&#39;t drive for a week. Also I started having ringing in my ears which is still present. Since then I&#39;ve had a number of other symptoms that have sort of come and gone. I&#39;ve noticed they have gotten bad my second half of my menstrual cycle. Iv had muscle spasms and nerve pain. My left leg felt like it was on fire for a while. Otherwise of yet I&#39;ve just felt like I&#39;ve had lower energy than normal and had more headaches.

I took benadryl, and was relieved of these symptoms. Then, around 9pm that night, I developed a fever. The highest temperature I recorded was 101.9. I took Ibuprofen around 11pm, and was afebrile by 3am. I have not had any fevers since, and I did have to call off work New Year&#39;s day. I have had an intermittent, mild headache since receiving the vaccine as well,  but overall I feel fine.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                Gradual onset of soreness beginning about an hour post-vaccine and worsening throughout day. By the evening, left arm pain was too uncomfortable to wash dishes and lift household objects. Pain woke me up at 3am that night and I could not push the covers off of me, dress or undress, and I experienced severe pain with slight movement (7/10). Nausea and cold sweats began around 5am and lasted for 45min. I contacted the nurse via messaging system and was told to take OTC nausea medicine and Tylenol. I took the maximum dosage for Tylenol that day but could not do my normal school functions. The next day I was still limited by pain but did not require medication to cope. By day three, I had full range of motion back and minimal pain. Day four I am back to exercising normally.

It became very painful by the time I went to bed. 10x worse than a flu shot Next morning at 8am, got up and almost passed out. Went back to bed. Got up at 10. Arm was painful to move.  Began fever at 12 noon.  Highest was 102. Terrible chills and aches and pains throughout entire body... lasted through bedtime. Tylenol did not  manage the symptoms. Day 3 I was much better. I did experience fatigue, but arm pain was wearing off quickly.

My headache persisted until later Saturday evening after taking over the counter Headache Relief. I gained my appetite early Sunday morning.

I went to the Emergency Department and got Prednisone, Pepcid, and Benadryl.  The next day, I started to experience tremors, mostly in my right hand.   Two days later, I was so dizzy that the room was spinning and I could hardly stand up. Did not receive treatment for it.

Now on 01/16/2021, I started getting a cough, a sore throat, a  fever, and extremely tired. Then the next day the symptoms got worse and now I had a stuffy nose, inner ear pain, nausea, muscle aches all over my body, dizzyness, and chills. This continued into Sunday and now Monday.

A few hours after that I had moderate soreness in L deltoid, down L arm (bicep/tricep), and up into L pec and trap. I had difficulty abducting L arm to 90 deg but was not hindered in normal movements. Approaching midnight that day the soreness was improving and by mid next day it was limited to L deltoid upon palpation. After 2-3 days soreness resolved. No other adverse effects noted.   I have had very minor muscle soreness to a few vaccinations before, but not this bad. In those cases it has been limited to site of injection (deltoid) and less severe. Usually I don&#39;t notice anything after injections and I&#39;ve never had any other adverse effects.

These symptoms lasted for over a week. The only syncope episode was the morning after the vaccine.

Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

Throughout the night arm pain got progressively worse and could not sleep due to extreme  pain and inability to move through range of motion, in addition to night sweats.  (did not have a fever). Woke up the next morning with a severe headache and nausea. Fainted around 10am (18 hours post vaccination). Headache and minor dizziness continued throughout the rest of the day.  By 24 hours post vaccine, no symptoms besides very minimal arm soreness.

Could not eat all day.  1/27- woke up with headache and slight body aches but otherwise felt okay during the day. Was hungry and able to eat. Starting at 10:00pm my stomach began to hurt again. Experienced bloating, sharp stabbing pain and nausea. Felt like I needed to vomit or pass a bowel movement but could not do either. Took Zofran at 11:00pm, did not help in relieving my GI symptoms. Still on round-the-clock extra strength Tylenol. Could not eat all night.   1/28- woke up still with headache, and mild-moderate stomach pain.  Able to eat a couple bites of food.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

                                                I got the shot at about 7:25pm on Saturday and then was scheduled to work the next morning, Sunday, at 4:30 am. I had not felt great from the moment I got up on Sunday, and felt progressively worse throughout the day. I had really bad body aches and chills, to the point where I was shivering, even with three layers and a puffy coat on. I normally never get cold. I also had a really bad headache. By the time my shift was over at 1pm, I wasn?t even sure I could trust myself to drive home. Eventually I decided it was fine, but by the time I got home I felt so terrible that it took me at least 15 minutes to get out of the car. I took a hot shower and went to bed. I was shivering violently, even with lots of blankets, and couldn?t even sit up to drink some water. I laid in bed for hours, doing absolutely nothing and feeling miserable. I got up after 7:00 pm to eat some dinner and felt so nauseous that I was dry-heaving into the toilet.

The majority of these symptoms started around 12 hours after the vaccination, with fever, chills, headache and dizziness being the most prominent. Ibuprofen (200mg) was taken about 18 hours in (as was advised to only take within the first 24 hours). Most of the symptoms are gone now after 24 hours of vaccination and taking ibuprofen. While most other symptoms are gone, there is still continued fatigue, and slight headache and nausea.

The following morning I woke up and got dressed and used the restroom. I proceeded downstairs to make my coffee.  As I was doing so I became dizzy and nauseous. I sat down on the floor and then I lost my vision and hearing. I broke out in a profuse sweat and had no concept of time. My boyfriend was with me and said it took 5-10 minutes before I began to normalize. I apparently had shallow breathing and turned pale white including my lips, I slowly regained awareness although I never fully lost consciousness. 911 was called and paramedics arrived. by this time I had begun to normalize with most of my vision returning. I ended up declining to see medical attention because I normalized and told the paramedics I would seek attention if it came back.  * please note the physician listed is my PCP but I was not seen for this reaction.

Approximately 13 hours after vaccination, I began to feel nauseous, dizzy, and shaky along with my earlier symptoms. I felt like I was going to faint with blurred vision and ringing in my ears even while lying down. I started sweating along with the chills. The dizziness and nausea subsided after approximately two hours. The headache lasted approximately 48 hours after the vaccination.

Patient called a friend to take her home once she was feeling better so she wasn&#39;t left alone.

                                                Joint pain and cracking at shoulder lasting a whole week now. After receiving my injection, I noticed that it was given very high up on my arm, just barely 1 finger width&#39;s away from my shoulder joint. As a healthcare provider myself, I know to be aware not to administer too high as this can result in shoulder injury. I unfortunately seem to have encountered this firsthand myself. I wanted to wait a week hoping the pain would go away, but it is still there even after a week. It was severe pain starting about 36 hours after receiving the shot, then for two more days, the pain was about 8/10. The pain has become less severe over time, but I am unable to use my left arm to the same capacity anymore due to this constant shoulder joint pain. Prior to this, I have never had any shoulder pain.

About an hour after receiving vaccine,  she went through a drive thru to order food and &#39;wasn&#39;t thinking right, like I had brain fog&#39;.  That lasted a short time.  About an hour after receiving vaccine, patient noticed lips and mouth were tingling &#39;like I had ate something really spicy&#39;.  This lasted off an on for about an hour.  Later that evening, patient felt dizzy and nauseated.  She laid down and took a nap and woke up feeling better.  Skin started to feel itchy that night.  On 2/27/21, patient woke up with an itchy rash all over back.  Rash is still there.  No other symptoms at this time.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

The next morning, I had a severe tightening of the left side of my neck and shoulder, along with arm soreness. I saw my Physical Therapist and was told that it was a result of the vaccine. I was fine until I got the vertigo Friday evening. It came on really quickly and I&#39;ve never experienced it before. I was okay the next morning with the exception of a headache, which lasted for about a month after that. My doctor offered shots for them, but I couldn&#39;t take them due to my current meds. I was told to come back if they continue.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID19 vaccine at 1030 via IM injection in left deltoid. Prior to injection, patient reported being nervous about fainting. She reported no prior history of fainting due to vaccination or blood draws; she &#34;passed out&#34; two years prior to dehydration at a music festival.  Approximately four minutes after injection, patient stated that she was going to &#34;pass out&#34; and had an episode of syncope. She exhibited pallor, dry heaving, and arm contractures. The nurse helped her to a supine position on the floor and called for assistance. The nurse team encouraged deep breathing and provided apple juice, pretzels, ammonia inhalent, and cool washcloths. EMS was called and arrived at 1045 for further assessment. Patient reported that she had not consumed any food or drink prior to vaccination and stated that her hands were &#34;tingly&#34;. EMS took blood pressure and heart rate; both were within normal range. The patient was taken to the hospital by EMS at 1055, where providers determined that syncope was likely caused by anxiety. Patient returned home and reported feeling tired but stable when health department called to check in at 1400.

                                                I have been experiencing intense upper arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow.  I am not able to lift my arm.  My blood work shows inflammation markers and low levels of ANA and IFA markers.  I did not have any of these symptoms or markers before taking the vaccine.  I am not able to go to work.  I have seen a primary care physician and a neurologist.  When taking the steroid Prednisone, the pain does subside, but I am not allowed to take a steroid for more than one week.   I stopped taking my second dose of Prednisone 4 days ago, and now all the pain has returned and I cannot lift my arm.  This situation is frustrating and scary.  The doctors do not have a diagnosis or treatment plan.  Pain relievers do not help at all.

                                                immediately following the vaccine I felt tired and feverish. I took ibuprofen and felt mostly fine. The symptoms went away 3 days after the vaccine. On Monday following the vaccine (4 days after the vaccine) I began feeling joint pain / stiffness at night. I thought it was from skiing  for 3 days after the vaccine but it did not go away. It got worse and I began feeling joint / muscle pain throughout my body, especially in the morning and night. When I wake up in the morning it still hurts to roll over. Once I am up and moving for the day and take ibuprofen I start to feel a bit better, but overall I feel very painful joint and muscle pain daily.

                                                Fatigue on 4/1/21 that became very noticeable around 2:45 pm. General muscle soreness/aches on 4/1/21 and a bit on 4/2/21. Left shoulder sore and uncomfortable to move through full range of movement from 4/1/21 afternoon until afternoon of 4/3/21. Soreness did noticeable die down as time passed.  Discomfort/muscle tightness starting around 3:00 pm 4/6/21 in the left axillary region. No swelling/redness/rash visible on surface. Discomfort most noticeable when stretching arm forwards/backwards or squeezing upper arm against side. Squeezing arm to side results in a feeling similar to if someone were trying to hold a marble in their armpit.   4/8/21 woke up still with arm pit discomfort and a return of the discomfort in the out shoulder muscle where the vaccine was administered.

A lot of discomfort from these sensations - Friday 4/16, pain in arm alleviated but heart rate still accelerated and pangs of pain in head. At night, numbness/tingling warmth in left hand and random shooting pain in area of left foot, ankle and shins.

The RN observed the patient at her vaccine station for 3 min then accompanied her to the observation area.  Per report of COVID-19 Patient Observer, pt was seen falling out of her chair in a seated position and it was unclear if she hit her head.  Per a witness, pt hit her head on the computer cart that was nearby.  The COVID-19 Patient Observer called for assistance and 911 was called.  She was immediately evaluated by COVID-19 Patient observer and RN and noted to be unresponsive initially.  The RN reported that she opened her eyes and became verbally responsive to verbal stimuli and touch.  Upon my arrival, pt was noted to be responsive and lying on floor on her abdomen.  She initially denied pain, but later complained of pain at crown of her head to touch.  Pt denied CP, HA, SOB, difficulty breathing, pruritis, rash, nausea, or visual disturbances.  Orthostatics were obtained (lying- 124/90-102; sitting- 137/81-115; Standing 123/87 - 96).  Patient maintained her O2 sat at 98% throughout the evaluation.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on 4/25/2021 at 2:50pm. Patient was in observation area chair 1 and technician noticed she was pale in color and patient waved technician over to her.  Technician went to her and then alerted Pharmacist that patient was feeling light headed and was pale.  I went to patient and asked her how she was feeling and if she was having any trouble breathing. Patient was starting to slouch in her chair and I asked her if I could lower her to the ground.  At that time, she passed out and was unresponsive.  I lowered her to the floor and supported her head with my hand.  She was unresponsive for about 5-10 seconds but then her eyes popped open wide and she made a large gasping breath.  She was very disoriented and asked what happened.  As I talked to her and asked her questions, she became oriented with her surroundings and was able to verbally communicate with me how she was feeling.  Patient was reporting tingling in hands, heart racing, and was visually shaky.  I asked her if she wanted me to call EMS and she responded yes.  At this time, patient was beyond the 15 minutes post observation waiting period.   Technician called emergency number, I stayed on the ground with the patient and continued to assess her symptoms and her breathing.  The color in her face resumed to normal and she was able to use her cell phone to contact her father.  While sitting on the ground with her, she reported she was beginning to feel better, but was still feeling weird in her head.  At that time, EMS arrived and took over.

                                                About 10 minutes post-vaccination, while  patient was seated in our post-vaccination area, she experienced shortness of breath, light headedness, and dizziness.  She did not lose consciousness.  Then she complained of nausea and thought she might vomit.  We called 911 due to the difficulty breathing.  By the time EMS arrived (within 10 minutes), patient was breathing normally and stated that she was feeling more normal.  EMS monitored her vital signs, which were all within  normal limits.  Once the dizziness passed, she was able to leave with her  brother.  I did speak with her by phone about 3 hours later.  She stated that she was feeling fine and that it must have been a panic attack (which she said she had experienced before).

The following morning I felt better, but I am still experiencing headaches and body aches, in addition to chest pain.

She was given some water to drink.  Then she said her dizziness was getting worse and was having a really bad headache.

Once patient started getting worse and started having visual changes with flashing lights, 911 was called immeidately and paramedics took over.

May6th- May 8th: Started to notice mosquito- bite like bumps on both lower extremities, both legs started to swelled up. But the right leg was more swollen than the left to the point that I couldn?t sleep or walk on it.   May 9th- I went to Emergency Care around 5am to be checked out cause it was hurting me so much.  They couldn?t figure out what had happened and they discharged me a few hours later with an order of Prednisone to take once a day for 7 days and preferred me to my PCP.   May 10th - We went to go see my PCP which she advised us to stop taking the prednisone and doctors orders was to stay out of work for a week in order to be off my feet.   She advised us to cancel the second vaccine appointment until everything clears up.

She kept seated on her chair for 10 more mins, after which she felt like she was about to faint.  She walked up to me (pharmacist) for assistance, at which point she lost consciousness for a brief second. My colleague and I held her and we laid her down on the floor. As soon as she was laid down she vomited. Her vomit was bright red color with granular particles. To avoid her from chocking, I immediately rolled her over to the left side at which point she said she is okay and needed to get up. She said that she just had some flaming hot chips before coming to get the vaccine. She was given water to drink and a granola bar to eat and she was monitored for another 30 minutes without any further issues.

                                                Within a minute of administering the vaccine, the patient felt her arm where the injection was administered go numb. She also felt sporadic muscle spasms going down her feet. She said she started to feel dizzy, so we laid her down on the floor with her 2 feet up on a chair. She laid there for few minutes after which she said she felt better. She sat up on the floor and her B.P reading was taken. Her B.P reading read 88/68 mmHg. On further investigation she stated that she has a history of anemia, but hasn&#39;t been to a doctor in a few years. On the floor (concrete), her body started to shiver, so we moved her to a chair and she was given water to drink and a granola bar to eat. She was also given a blanket and some hot chocolate to drink. 15 minutes later, her B.P reading was checked again and it was 111/78mmHg. We monitored her for 30-40 minutes and after she felt back to normal she was asked to take some rest at home and follow up with a physician to make sure her Hemoglobin levels.

                                                Obese female patient with history of diabetes and seizure came to our pharmacy for second Moderna  covid dose.  A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, she was feeling lightheaded and nausea. I asked the patient to come back in to the consultation room where she could sit or lay down on the floor. The patient was able to walk back into the room with a little assistance from her mother. She sat on the floor for a bit, still breathing fine, and said she wanted to throw up. I grabbed a trash can, napkins, and a pedialyte bottle for her. She did not throw up but started breathing a little heavier and said she was about to faint. I got the epi pen ready and told her please lay down if she has to. At this point she fell to her right side and slightly hit her head against the wall. It appeared that she stopped breathing for few seconds, but  I still felt a pulse on her wrist. It also appeared that she went into a seizure, her upper body stiffened up and her arms were slightly flailing. I immediately called 911  and about 1 minute later, both the mother and I could clearly see the patient breathing as indicative by the rising/lowering chest. I also felt a stronger pulse on her wrist. I did not inject the epi pen. Paramedics arrived shortly and after about 5-10 minutes of talking to her, the patient began to gain conscious but looked exhausted. They transported her to the hospital. Per the mother, patient was completely fine after the first dose of Moderna;  also just had a seizure a few days before the second Moderna dose. The whole incident was about 20 minutes from administering the vaccine to paramedics transporting her away.

Somewhere between 5-8pm the, began to feel feverish and got a headache, mild body soreness. Required ibuprofen 200mg x1. Overnight had a fever and two episodes of sweating, chills, shaking.

                                                awoke at 2 am  with nausea, chills, generalized pain. Immediately felt myself start to pass out or have a seizure- I am not sure which. Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

Acupuncture gave relief for 2 days so that I could lift it. Pain and ache returned. Ibuprofen and Tylenol do not lessen the pain at all.  Ache-type pain radiates down the arm and across the upper back. For the last 2 days, it hurts whether or not I?m moving it. The vaccine was given far too high in the arm.

These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

                                                A few hours after the first dose (1/15), a welt grew around the injection site about the size of a silver dollar.  This went away after three days. Arm was sore for the first two days.  One week later (1/22), injection site became itchy, red and was very warm to the touch.  A welt formed as well. It started out the size of a silver dollar, and over the course of  48 hours the welt, itchiness, and redness grew to  the size of a large russet potato (Friday 1/22- Saturday1/23).  It was the most red around the injection site, with the most red being about the size of a silver dollar.  After 48 hours, it remained itchy, red, and had a welt  for the next 24 hours  (Sunday 1/24). The next morning (Monday 1/25) redness and swelling were gone but site was still a little itchy.  Site was only slightly tender throughout these three days but not painful. No other side effects were noticed i.e. fever, chills, chest pain.  Slight dizziness was felt if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything.

                                                After about two hours my arm pain was so intense it felt like it was nearly broken and continued to feel worse. I had EXTREME headache and nausea which nearly led to vomiting but kept having to hold it down while alternating between Advil and Tylenol and Tums just to feel a little relief. Pain medications did not help substantially for the first 36 hours. I felt bed bound , had no energy to even move to pick up the TV control a few feet away from me. I had SEVERE chills, and still have them nearly 56 hours out with the headache and nausea still prevalent . I had such bad body aches and dizziness. Have had a hard time getting sleep because of the intensity of my symptoms. Absolutely has been the worst ever and I would NEVER get this shot again. Y?all need to do better. This is completely unacceptable for this to be side effects experienced by people even if it?s less than 10% experiencing the severity I felt. This is so messed up on so many levels. I?m going into medicine myself and although I believe in vaccines, this is not one I will be advocating for until research gets it together and provides a vaccine that is safer for people to receive. Completely anxious and worried and scared as to how my next few days and weeks will go especially with how severe my side effects have been and the news articles showing how some people seem to be dying within hours or days of the Moderna and Pfizer shots. Unacceptable. I can?t believe the amount of fear for my life I have right now.

This was longer.  I had no control of my body, I was conscious the second time.  I attempted to tell myself to &#34;focus&#34; and try and find something with my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t; I was stuck in the state of my body shaking and unable to see anything. After the two times, I had the shakes.

                                                With the second dose I felt arm pain at the injection site and muscle pains, my whole body was aching, specially my arms, both of them. My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 3pm 1/13/21. I was fine for the 30 minutes after, not even sore at the injection site.  Around 6pm, my muscles started aching, but not painful enough to be concerned.  At 3am 1/14/21, I woke up in pain in every muscle. Enough to wake me, but not terrible.  At 7am, I noticed a pinpoint pain in my armpit, and my muscles still ached.  At 9:30am, I took ibuprofen to attempt to curb the pain a bit.  Around 10am, it got so painful I was limping, and having trouble bending down or reaching above shoulder height.  At 11:30am, I noticed the pinpoint pain in my armpit had gotten worse, and there is a hard, approximately quarter-sized round lump in this spot. Very painful.  At 2:30, I went to move my shirt sleeve and the pain at the injection site was so intense I screamed when I touched it.  This pain continued until 1/16/21 when I woke up feeling entirely normal.  Since 1/16/2021, my hands have been randomly stiffening, either completely stretched out and dropping anything in them, or closing tight enough to leave fingernail marks on my palms. I will also reach to grab things and my hands will sometimes bend into odd shapes, instead of what I intended for them to do. This began at 1-2 times a day, and is becoming more often. It is now up to 2-4 times daily.

                                                Pain began in upper right arm and radiated down to wrist for first week. Upon slightest movement around arm, pain ensued even worse as is and did not allow sleep. Pain has  limited shoulder mobility for 2 weeks. Received Hydrocodeine-acetiminophen and Ibuprofen at ER on Monday January 25 for 3 days. Then, upon follow up with PCP, medication for pain relief was prescribed as followed: ibuprofen 800 mg and Gabapentin. Pain has subsided but remains upon slight movement of shoulder.

                                                Around 7:00 PM, on the day I received the 2nd vaccine, I developed a fever that lasted for 24 hours. I took advil to combat it, which helped, but it always came back until around 7:00 PM the following day. Along with this, my body ached making it tough to move. Once these two side effects went away, the next two days consisted of a severe migraine when bending down and standing up. This particular side effect did not affect my daily life, though.

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

                                                Around 5 pm on 2/11 (day of vaccination) I began to notice a very sore arm and dry mouth/dehydration. Drank water and continued as normal. Around 2 am of 2/12 I woke up with chills and had been sleeping very restlessly.  I had body aches in my arm, legs and back. Around 3am my temperature was 100.2. I also felt very faint when standing and thought I may pass out.  3 times when standing, I had to quickly sit down to avoid it. I do suffer from vasovagal syncope so this may be unrelated to vaccination. I took Tylenol and drank more water. Temp rose to about 100.6 before beginning to drop at around 4 am. I continued to take Tylenol every 4 hours and it helped keep temp below 100 but towards the end of the 4 hours, it would start to rise again. I ate normally and drank extra water due to feeling dehydrated still. Around 1 PM 2/12 I started to feel nauseous and had an upset stomach. I was still have a general body aches and elevated temperature around 99.5. My normal temp is usually about 98.0. Nausea led to diarrhea 1 time. Symptoms continued until approximately 8 pm when very quickly the body aches, nausea, fever and soreness in injection arm all went away. None of these symptoms have returned and it is now 2/13 at 8 pm.   I did test positive for Covid-19 on December 28, 2020 but have been fully recovered with no symptoms since 1/8/2021.

It does not itch, but appears to be spreading on the same arm of the vaccination.

                                                the first day (1/16/21) following the first dose of the  vaccine, i began experiencing nausea. the third day (1/18/21) i vomited that morning once but then not again throughout that day.  after that for about two weeks, i was just generally nauseous and also had no appetite. food tasted off to me. this went away after two weeks, but then i got my second dose on 2/12/21. on 2/13/21, i spent about 12 vomiting very consistently, about every 10-15 minutes. i also had chills alternating with profuse sweating and hot flashes, but did not ever have a fever. other symptoms included headache, extreme fatigue, dizziness, body aches, shortness of breath, and chest pains. the next day, i was fine aside from some slight lingering nausea but no vomiting. since then, i have experienced nausea intermittently every day, and have vomited on more than a dozen of those days. i have no appetite, and have now lost ten pounds since getting the second dose. i realized that my main food aversion is to meat, i will vomit every single time i eat meat now. i?m not sure if this is my reaction to the texture and taste like i think it is, or if it?s actually more like an allergic response by my stomach. i also still struggle with shortness of breath and feeling like my chest is tight, as well as dizziness and a nagging cough.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

I went to bed and my body wouldn?t warm up under the covers. I woke up around 1:16am feeling very hot. I was running a fever of about 102F. After removing the covers and using a cold compress it dropped to the 99F range and fluctuated quickly between about 98.7F-99.9F. I continued to have chills and feel very cold during this fluctuation. When I would stand to go to the bathroom my body would be very weak and I would get almost lightheaded.  I fell asleep by about 3:30am. The following morning my fever was completely resolved. I continued to feel weak during the first half of the day with some mild intermittent nausea. By the second half of the day my side effects resolved entirely.

I am not sure if the acne cream got in my eye the night before the vaccine. it is called Retin A cream 0.025%. I have also been feeling very weak. I got a B12 injection on my butt for energy(Friday, march 12). My legs feel like they are in pain and the hurt when I walk. I also had a lot of pelvic pain after the vitamin injection. I drank ibuprofen March 14 at night. I woke up feeling very weak. Before going to bed on March 15 I drank Tylenol. I still feel pain in my legs today and now I have lower back pain.

                                                Patient  came to the center for a Moderna vaccine at 5pm. The patient expressed that she felt dizzy shortly after immunization (before leaving the immunization chair). Her head began to fall backwards so I quickly supported the patient&#39;s head and neck area and was able to keep her from falling out of her chair. The patient fainted but regained consciousness approximately 3 seconds later. The patient came back alert but nauseous. The patient vomited in a trashcan and then felt fine. The patient blamed the reaction on her severe anxiety and said the exact same thing happened after a nose piercing. I observed the patient for 30 minutes and sent her on her way. The patient left healthy and happy. I told the patient to warn the pharmacist prior to receiving her second dose. No drugs were administered. Written up in SCRT and VAERS. I followed up with the patient at 7 pm and she was home safe.

                                                Patient was vaccinated around 10:55 AM. Within a couple of minutes she started feeling lightheaded, sweaty, and had blurry vision while sitting. She reported no history of blood sugar issues, but she said she only had some donut to eat today. I initially gave her three glucose tablets and a bottle of water, which she sipped. She reported feeling better within a few minutes. I checked her blood pressure at 10:59 AM. It read low at 81/44 with a pulse of 73. But, I checked again since I doubted the accuracy of the reading. The second reading was 101/56, with a pulse of 79. Patient said she was feeling better, but continued to sit. I gave her one more glucose tablet to equal a total of 16 g of carbs given. She sat for at least fifteen minutes until she felt well enough to get up and shop. She checked back after shopping and said she was fine.

A couple minutes later she was feeling better, but she was asked to remain sitting for another 10 mins to monitor her. She claimed to be dehydrated, and had not eaten much of anything today. Her friend brought her some water and food. After eating a bit and drinking the water she said she was feeling almost normal. We provided a motorized cart for her even though she said she was fine to walk. I gave the patient a follow up call a few hours later and she claimed to be feeling fine.

This led to them recommending that I go to the hospital to have blood taken due to them being uncomfortable with my results to make sure I was okay.

                                                I received the vaccination on April 25th at 2:15pm. I waited at the facility until 2:30pm to be sure I didn&#39;t have any immediate side effects or allergic reactions. Upon arriving home around 3:00pm, I noticed the injection sight had become itchy. I then noticed later in the day that my arm was beginning to hurt and the pain progressively got worse. By the end of the day, I was unable to move my arm much without any pain.  The next morning (April 26th), the injection sight was swollen upon physical examination but was not noticably swollen. I did not check the sight through the day but noticed at the end of the day when getting ready for bed (around 9:00pm) that the injection sight was swollen, itchy, red, and extremely sensitive to touch.   Today, April 27th, the sight is still red, sensitive, and swollen but the pain level in relation to moving my arm has decreased dramatically throughout the day and I am able to move with little to no pain.

                                                Within 10 minutes of vaccination, patient developed increasingly blurry vision, hearing loss, a feeling of faintness, cold, clammy skin, and sweating. Patient was asked to lie down on the floor with feet elevated but patient did not want to leave the chair she was sitting in. Patient was feeling increasingly faint and experiencing increasing panic due to her vision and hearing loss. EMTs were called and responded within 20 minutes of the call. Patient vision and hearing were returning by the time EMTs arrived. They checked her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation,  and blood glucose - all were within normal range. The patient refused transport to the hospital and left with her significant other as her driver after she was feeling normal again.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after the injection, I began having persistent ice pick headaches, which lasted 1-2 hours. I have a history of these, but they are almost never so intense.  About 25 hours after the injection, I began having intense pain in the center of my chest. It dissipated and returned a couple of times over the next 5 hours or so. The pain was so great that it was difficult to stand, and I came close to passing out. I have not experienced this severe level of pain since about 30 hours post-injection.

I had a hard time sleeping - nausea and headache throughout the  night. 4/3 - extremely tired; felt like I couldn&#39;t get enough air (shortness of breath) body aches and muscles aches - over all lethargic. 4/4 - I was dizzy, short of breath . Those two symptoms lasted along with fatigue - which lasted for two days. I almost passed out that day - everything went black and I had to be assisted to the couch to recover from that.  I used Tylenol for my symptoms when needed.   I still have ongoing headaches - three weeks ago (about a week after I got the vaccine) - I noticed I was having ongoing headaches and I still have these.  Pregnancy - 2nd pregnancy; 1st one was full term. Date of delivery expected - September 9, 2021.

                                                Immediately after the shot I felt fine, I went to bed on 5/9 and woke up the next day with a very arm sore, I couldn&#39;t lift it above my shoulder. On the second day 5/11 I took the bandaid off and noticed that it was red underneath the bandaid. The soreness had gone down, but I noticed a new swelling, slight itchiness and heat coming from the spot. The swelling was bulbous and round around my shoulder muscle. If the swelling or soreness doesn&#39;t go down by tomorrow, I might make an appointment to see a doctor.

I am breastfeeding my 5 month old daughter, so sleep is already  broken up but I can normally sleep soundly between each feed.   In the middle of the night, i had a mild fever and troubles walking 5m.  In the morning (05/21/21), I took a paracetamol 500, still had fever, migraine, chills, and was generally very weak.  At 2pm, I took a paracetamol 1g and at 2.30pm, my temperature under the arm was 37.8°C.  Thanks to the paracetamol the fever went down but I still a a strong migraine.  8pm, temperature at 38.4 under the armpit, took paracetamol 1g.  Fever and chills went down,  still had the migraine and nausea.  05/22/21: 2am, chills and general pain, took a paracetamol 1g.  Could sleep 8am, no fever still headache.  Migraine and nausea all day.  10pm, no symptoms anymore except for the muscular pain in the right arm when the injection was done.  05/23/21. Only subsides the muscular pain in the right arm.

                                                It started out with vomiting and fever and then really bad stomach pains. Stomach pains after anything I ate or drank. That happened for a couple of days. Then I had blood in my stool and it was like diarrhea. So I went to the ER on 02/09/2021 and they gave me a CAT scan and said there might have been some kind of colitis. Referred me to a specialist. Right after I went home and two days later I went back to the ER with even worse pain. Had blood in my vomit and was kept there for a couple of hours. They again referred me to another gastro appointment. I wasn&#39;t able to get into a gastro appointment until 02/26/2021 I believe. When I saw the specialist they said that my symptoms had to do with Colitis. Symptoms worsened and I was admitted again. Became to weak and couldn&#39;t walk. I lost like 15lbs. Sched for 03/08/2021 was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. I was point on medication and put on medical leave for three weeks. I started mesalamine treatment. That didnt work so now im on a biological treatment for every 8 weeks or until further notice.  REMICADE is what I was prescribed. My iron levels had dropped and I had to get two iron treatments through I.V. as well. Seen hematologist

She said that she felt light-headed and that she was itching all over. I gave her Benadryl 25 and asked her wait around. After about 10 minutes she said that she needed my help. She said that she needed an EpiPen shot because her heart was racing, she was sweating, and her tongue was beginning to feel swollen. I gave her the EpiPen shot and called 911. She was released from the hospital about midnight.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

                                                I walked in to received my first dose of the Moderna Covid19 vaccine at approx 12:20pm 1/7/21. The RN who was giving me my injection palpated the top of my shoulder and NOT my acromian process and administered the injection closer to the top of my shoulder, the vaccine did initially hurt more than a typical vaccine would when it was being administered but i thought that might have been normal. Approximately 1hr after receiving the vaccine my left shoulder joint started to have this pinching sensation in the anterior joint when I would raise my arm forward. The pain got progressively worse throughout the day with significantly decreased range of motion in that shoulder and significant pain in my shoulder joint. The pain was so bad it actually kept me from sleeping that night. I never had any muscular pain or any other symptoms beside the joint pain, which was alarming since it should have been administered into the muscle. I believe the vaccine my have been incorrectly injected into the shoulder joint or potentially a smaller muscle in the shoulder. The pain and decrease ROM is preventing me from doing most of my regular day to day activities. Today 1/9/21 has been a full 48hrs after receiving the vaccine and the joint pain has not gotten any better and my range of motion is still significantly decreased, which would prevent me from performing my tasks as an RN.

Unsure of exact vaccination date and onset of symptoms.  really having to focus to place hands under water to wash them, walking through doors without bumping into them, turning on faucet, getting dressed; left hand is worse than right and not able to easily align things properly;  &#34;feels like her brain isn&#39;t doing what she&#39;s telling it to do&#34;.  Aunt said the symptoms are not improving. Patient had tested negative for Covid the day she got the vaccine.

On Tuesday 1/5/2021 developed hives on feet and ankles. Dizziness worsened and hives had spread to hands and wrists the following day. Upon arriving to work on Thursday 1/7/2021, hives had progressively gotten worse and I was tachycardic. Called employee health where I was instructedto go to the ED. Was tachycardic 100-130 bpm and hypertensive 156/112mmHg upon arrival to the ED. Received IV Benadryl and Decadron for the reaction/hives. Viotals were normal upon discharge. Continued with Prednisone and benadryl. Taking Meclizine to help with dizziness.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

Post vaccination she was seated in the passenger seat in vaccine pod observation lot and felt like she &#34;was going to pass out&#34;. Her husband got the attention of the paramedic overseeing the area. She did not become unresponsive at any time but became very pale. Her BP was 80/40 when initially checked. EMS was call and she was shortly thereafter taken to a local ED via non emergent transport. Her husband had driven her to the pod site and did not receive a vaccination.  She was discharged home yesterday.

                                                I received my vaccine around 12:45pm. They had me go to waiting room and wait for 10 mins. I sat down and was waiting for a few minutes when I started to get dizzy. I looked up and told the lady checking people in ?hey I?m getting really dizzy can I lay down? she said yes come in the room. When I stood up my heart started beating really fast. I sat on the table and my chest started feeling tight and heavy. There were 2 ladies in the room at this point so I asked one of them if they had an epipen on hand just in case. My throat wasn?t swelling but it was getting harder to breath from the tightness in my chest. She said they didn?t have an epipen and would have to call emergency services if I needed one. I told her I didn?t know what was going on, that I didn?t need one yet but she should probably call emergency services if they can?t do anything to help me. (ER is right across the street) my symptoms went away shortly after they called. But came on a couple more times but much milder over the next 30 minutes or so. The EMT gave me Benadryl and the ER ran some tests.

I then began feeling lightheaded and dizzy about 2 hours after vaccination. Shortly after I became feverish with chills. I then took 2 Ibuprofen and fever/chills subsided, however lightheadedness continued but improved slightly.

                                                Several minutes after the vaccine she became light headed, EMT evaluated her and stated she was tachycardic (did not give a pulse) and was initially unable to find a BP.  She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

                                                By 3:30pm I had a fever and experienced arm soreness to my right arm. By 11:30pm I could not move my arm and also could not pick my son up who  weighs 30 pounds. On the following day I continued with severe  body aches  and joint pain. I went to see a doctor about 10:00am who examined me and advised my to take Tylenol and Ibuprofen  for pain.  They did a Covid-19 swab which as negative.  My symptoms are improving and I can say that it took about 24 to 48 hours to recover from my right arm.

Several hours later the aches moved to upper body aches causing pain breathing. Upon night, dizziness had set in. I fell unconscious hitting my head and received treatment for a concussion. I am currently pending a CT Scan to check for brain bleeding.

She was placed in a recumbent position on the exam twith legs elevated and vital signs were obtained, they were within normal limits. Pt then reported that it felt like she had something in the right side of her throat - she declined epinephrine injection. RN and LVN stayed at bedside. Pt then stated that both sides of her throat felt blocked and gave consent for epinephrine injection. RN administered 0.3 mg epinephrine and activated EMS. Vitals signs, breathing and circulation monitored closely until EMS arrival. Pt was transported by ambulance to the hospital emergency department for evaluation.

                                                The staff from another of our own company facility had come for getting vaccinated at this Clinic. After around 15 minutes or so after vaccination, she was feeling little light headed, and nauseating and tried throwing up during the observation period as per protocol after vaccination. We advised her to stay longer and  as precaution, we reached out to our facility, who advised to observe her for some more time and if she does not feel better, she can go to Urgent care accompanied by someone. We gave her Gatorade and after around 40-45 minutes she was feeling better and someone from her family came to pick her up. She did not wanted to go to Urgent Care at that time but we advised her if she does not feel good, she should go to Urgent Care.

Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

                                                I first got symptoms on Jan 19th with extreme muscle soreness from my shoulders to my toes with hives on my thighs and what felt like a bug bite on my knuckle and a circular bite on my left forearm.  The muscle soreness was there for 3 days.  It was very hard to walk for a while cause of just the soreness.  I still feel a little in my ankles and toes still but fully recovered.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

                                                Woke up around 5AM with a severe headache and tenderness at injection site. Throat was also very dry. Was not able to go back to sleep due to pain. Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

Had shoulder soreness day 2 post vaccine and was taking Motrin and Tylenol with some relief. Pain continued to get better. On day 9 post vaccine, pain returned with intensity and was seen at urgent care on 1/9. Shoulder was swollen and red at the time, so urgent care NP diagnosed cellulitis and I was prescribed Keflex, along with instruction to continue taking Motrin, Tylenol. Called out of work on 1/11 d/t shoulder pain/decreased range of motion. Today (1/13) pain is much better but still having some pain/discomfort in the shoulder.

A few seconds afterwards, I started to feel nauseated. Immediately, I felt weak, light-headed, and tired. I began to sweat profusely, as well. I could barely move my arm to flag down one of attendants who was monitoring us. She asked me what was wrong, and I tried to describe what was going on, but I could barely talk or keep my eyes open. She radioed for help and the paramedics came over to me. They wanted to move me to a private room and asked if I could walk. I tried to walk there, but I started to fall so one of the paramedics hoisted me up to help me. They asked me some questions will they were waiting for a stretcher, all of which I could hear and understand, but I was unable to response to. The stretcher came and I laid down, but I was already starting to feel better by then. I was very out of it, but I think this entire process took maybe 10-15 minutes. I laid there for maybe another 15 minutes, and I began to be able to talk again and open my eyes. I tried sitting up and that went alright. I answered some questions for them while they took my blood pressure, monitored my pulse, and took my temperature. After another 15 minutes or so, I felt well enough to walk back to my office in the Health Department. I didn&#39;t have any other problems for the rest of the day.

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was able to taste the vaccine,. Within 5 minutes I felt dizzy and within 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t feel my arm.  I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 21 Jan 2021, approximately two hours prior to the start of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 032L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Approximately two hours after receiving the vaccine at 12:30 pm, the patient experienced heavy feeling in her neck and face area that hurt really bad. Later, she noticed numbness in her hands and feet. Slurred speech was reported from a bystander. By 3:30pm, the patient was completely paralyzed on her right side. She was taken to the hospital, and a code stroke was initiated; however, all labs were normal.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient was still paralyzed on her right side, unable to walk, had shooting pain feeling, and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly. The doctors planned to discharge her on the next day to a rehab center because she could not function alone.  Treatment for the event included pain medication and hospitalization.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly, unable to walk and shooting pain feelings were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 25-year-old, female, patient, who experienced heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly and shooting pain feelings.

The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

                                                Starting about 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt feverish (no fever), lightheaded and dizzy. The doctor on site had me wait for an hour until I felt well enough to drive home. Over the next several hours, my lightheadedness became so bad I felt as though I would faint if I stool for longer than a few minutes. On Saturday, 2-13-21, I did pass out on the stairs and again in my livingroom. On Sunday, 2-14-21, I decided to go to urgent care in which I was told to &#34;wait it out&#34;. However, my symptoms had gotten worse over the last couple days to include body aches, headaches, muscle/joint pain, congested sinuses, slight cough, and feeling feverish (no fever) along with being dizzy. Therefore, I went to the ER later that morning 2-14-21, to see if I could get better treatment for my symptoms. I received IV fluids and they preformed blood work, a urinanalysis and an ECG. I was released from the ER around 8pm. My symptoms were better for the remainder of the evening, but have gone back to what I was feeling before for the last several days. My symptoms have been unresolved now for 1 week. I am getting tested for COVID-19 on Saturday 02-20-21.

I was so light headed I thought I would pass out if I stood up. I went to ER - Dr thought it was  from my wearing personal protection equipment - mask and goggles for work after receiving the vaccine. He told me I was fine but I was so much in  pain that I was too out of it to ask for tests. I was in pain for two week. Chest was in pain.  I had to use my inhaler once a day at least - sometimes more.

I took 2 extra strength Tylenol at that time, put an ice pack on my forehead, and drank a Pedialyte.   In addition to those, at about 4 I had ringing in my left ear and then lost the hearing in it. I just went to bed. When I woke up, around 10am on Friday, I could hear, but super dizzy. I couldn?t really walk without  feeling like I?m going to fall over, especially with turns. All symptoms continued throughout all of Friday.  I continued to take the Tylenol per the instructions on the bottle with my last dose around 5pm, I also drank 3 more pedialytes throughout the day in addition to plenty of other fluids. Took a warm shower around 7PM which seemed to help some with body aches and chills, however, dizziness/vertigo remained.  Saturday I woke up several times drenched in sweat. Around 9am my fever was gone. Still feeling a little ?off? in terms of balance/vertigo but nothing compared to Friday.  Slight body aches remain. Other symptoms gone.

                                                Around 6:00 pm on the day of vaccination I started to feel very fatigued and developed body aches - this felt similar to the beginning of developing Covid-19 symptoms. (I had Covid-19 back in November of 2020)   Around 8:00 pm I had developed some head congestion and swollen lymph nodes along with some throat pain and sinus congestion - again feeling very similar to Covid-19 symptoms.   Around 10:00 pm as I was heading to bed the symptoms became  a lot worse, I had pretty intense body aches and started to experience chills as well as a slight fever (around 99.5 in F). At this time the symptoms felt similar to how I had felt during the worst of my previous Covid-19 symptoms, very weak and achy, headache was very bad, and felt very uncomfortable overall.   Around 2:00 am on March 13 I woke up with a fever of 101.8. The previous symptoms had also gotten worse, I was having a hard time getting out of bed because things were very uncomfortable, I drank a lot of water and took some ibuprofen to combat the fever, about an hour after this the fever had come down to about 99.9 and I was able to fall asleep, but before taking the medication I couldn&#39;t have fallen asleep because of the discomfort of the aches, chills, and fever.   Throughout the following day I was unable to complete many of my day to day activities without taking a daytime cold and flu medication. With the medication I still felt sick but was able to walk around and complete some simple household chores, this carried through into the evening, when the medication wore off the chills and aches and headache were much worse and I still had a fever around 99-100. That night I was able to sleep with the cold and flu medication taken right before bed.  Upon waking up the next morning (March 14) I still had some congestion, headache, and general discomfort but the worst of the aches were gone and I no longer had a fever, these symptoms continued to diminish throughout the day.   On March 15 and March 16th I have had a slight lingering congestion headache, this also feels really similar to the lingering headache I had upon recovering from Covid-19. It is not debilitating and is continuing to improve. Otherwise I am feeling healthy again and have been able to complete my usual activities and even exercise.   Overall the symptoms felt like a couple days of having Covid-19 again, but recovery was much faster, and it was definitely worth receiving that first dose of the vaccine and getting started with the process of doing my part to reduce community spread.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.

Diarrhea has persisted since hours after the vaccine, almost a month later including painful stomach cramping. These gastrointestinal symptoms were not present beforehand and appeared at the same time as the other side effect but the GI issues have not resolved or even lessened. I may need to seek medica attention if it persists.

                                                I received my first Covid - 19 vaccine on March 25, 2021. The next day I felt extremely dizzy starting around 4:00pm. This was able to be resolved by increasing hydration. The following morning I felt much better with no other side effects. Just over a week later (4/2/21) I woke up around 7:00am and noticed a rash around the injection sight. It is not itchy but it feels warm and hard to the touch. The shape is somewhat of an irregular  oval about two inches long and an inch wide. I also have a smaller circular spot just below the larger spot. The rash is currently only located on my left arm right near the injection site.

Her vision blurred; she felt dizzy; she had a hard time hearing herself, although she could hear me fine; and she felt faint.  We had her sit back down and got her some water, checking on her every 5 minutes or so.  She was still dizzy, but not as faint.  She also reported a cold sweat.  We got her some orange juice and continued checking on her.  She called her husband to come and get her.  She was able to get up and walk out of her own accord with her husband.  We will follow up with her tonight to see how she is doing.

                                                These were symptoms after 2nd shot.  I started with a mild headache and sore arm. Then things got worse. At night on Wednesday, 24th, I got a severe headache that was at the back of my neck and could feel in the back of my head. Then I became so achy. My bones and joints hurt so much. It hurt to sit or lay down. All I could feel is the pain in my joints. I became so weak and so achy that I could barely get up and walk to the restroom. I could it stand for more than 2 minutes due to the pain. The subsided slightly on Thursday night, 25th, at 6pm. But then returned in another way. I became very nauseous and dizzy. My muscles instead of my bones began to hurt extremely. I could barely move. I broke down crying a couple of times due to the pain being so intense. Throughout this time, I did try to eat or snack and continue to drink water and Gatorade.  Then finally the pain just all of a sudden went away on Friday, 26th, at 1:00pm. I felt like a different person. The pain was gone. The only lingering effect was when I would get up from sitting down, I would be dizzy and my head would throb for a few seconds. That went away on Saturday night, 27th.  I will say if that type of pain had continued on much longer, I might have had my husband take me to the Emergency Room.

The ?snow? in front of my eyes got worse too where I couldn?t almost see anything for over probably 3 minutes and I broke in cold sweat.After the diarrhea I had a very sharp pain in my lower abdomen. That all lasted a few minutes and I didn?t have phone on me and I was alone so I helplessly sat on the floor through it all til I started feeling bit by bit better.The fever continued for 48 hours as well as extreme arm pain for 3 days where I got my vaccine.

My muscles were weak and it was hard to move. I then vomited twice. This lasted until I fell asleep on the floor, perhaps 45 minutes. When I awoke 2 hours later, the dizziness and weakness subsided.

Low fever, dizziness, and chills set in around 24 hours later (Sunday midday), including a change in color and consistency of nasal mucous (thicker, green). At about 40 hours post-vaccine (Monday morning) most of the symptoms had dissipated aside from the fatigue and an atypical level of brain fog, which has gradually improved over the course of the week and is still present.  No treatment taken. Normal amount of sleep &amp; caffeine intake, normal daily dosage of Vyvanse 60mg since Monday.

                                                I received the injection in my shoulder joint and immediately I knew something was wrong. It was not in the deltoid and was extremely painful. It felt like someone was shoving a pencil in my arm. Since then, I have experienced a loss of ROM and severe pain (all over my upper arm constantly with a shooting pain if I try to move my arm). I am in extreme pain and still cannot move my arm.  I have tried doing some range of motion exercises, but it is not helping. The pain is keeping me from sleeping and working. I went to my primary care doctor and they said the symptoms would go away in a week, but I am very worried that it would be a SIRVA issue.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, the arm it was given to me in was basically dead - very weak, achy, hand couldn&#39;t really grip anything. About 3 minutes after, I was very dizzy and sweaty, and a bit nauseated. Felt like I might pass out.  Starting about 11 hours after the vaccine, and lasting almost 3 days, I had: Extreme body pain, much worse than usual (I have chronic illnesses and I&#39;m always in pain) and more widespread. Low fever. Tiredness.  The hand on the arm where I received dose one of the vaccine still doesn&#39;t have its strength back almost 4 weeks later - can&#39;t open bottles or spray hairspray.  Cannot consume things with bergamot anymore - 1 week following the vaccine I tried to drink a tea that I drink weekly that has bergamot in it. Became incredibly dizzy, there was nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating. Tried it again a week later and had the same reaction. Decided I&#39;d wait until a month after the SECOND dose before trying it again, so may still be sensitive.

Overnight my arm hurt so bad i couldn&#39;t roll over onto that side or lift my arm up. I developed a fever around 11 pm and it spiked to 101.4 for a few hours before I started taking motrin. Fever was gone by the morning but I had to take it around the clock for about 48 hours or else the body aches and chills would set back in.

The headache felt like a migraine, but went away with the Tylenol. I could not think straight all day.; 24 hours later (Day 2, mid day): threw up once, felt like I could not walk 10 feet without overdoing it. Motion made the nausea worse.; 30 hours later (Day 2, afternoon): took pepto bismol for the nausea. This helped reduce the nausea, but I was still queasy; 32 hours later (Day 2, evening): headache came back. Took 2 extra strength Tylenol to treat. Still very fatigued. I did not feel like I could get out of bed.; 44 hours later(Day3, morning): woke up with a headache, fatigue, and nausea. At this point, I could keep down water, pedialyte, and saltine crackers. Took 2 extra strength Tylenol to treat the headache. Still could not think straight; (Day3, mid-day): Tired, nausea going away (Day4): Neck pain, could not think straight, tired, appetite coming back (Day5): Tired but mostly back to normal The arm pain was bad days 1-2 but got better on day 3. This was way worse than any time I have ever had the flu or pneumonia. I have never been so fatigued that I felt like I could not walk anywhere. The nausea and fatigue were inhibiting to daily activities.

                                                I received my vaccine in the evening and felt alright until I woke up the next morning. I typically do chores first thing on Saturdays, so I got up to do my chores and recognized that I needed to lay down less than 10 minutes into cleaning the kitchen. I felt weak, slightly dizzy, achy, and had a mild headache. I laid there from 7:30am-6:30pm only getting up to potty. I drank 100&#43; oz of water and a large energy drink while in bed. Over the course of the day, the headache is what became unbearable. My sinuses filled up and it turned into a migraine around 3pm. I had rice around 10am so my partner made me soup with a baguette at 6:30. I ended up calling my dad at 6:30, a 30&#43; year Hospital CEO, to confirm that taking a tylenol would be okay. He said it would be fine. When I took it, I felt better within 20 minutes. Within an hour I felt like I only had allergies. I was eating and watching TV. However, I was tired and wouldn&#39;t have walked far. The next morning I woke up with a severe enough headache that I took a tylenol and drank a coffee (I hear caffeine expedites medication) and by 10am I was at a hardware store buying stuff for house projects.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Symptoms were experienced 8 minutes after first dose was administered. Symptoms included dizziness  with the feeling of loss of balance while seated. I felt weak and couldn&#39;t lift my hand up. Fast heart rate: it felt like my heart was beating in my mouth. My throat (underneath the chin area) felt hot and later elevated to a burning sensation under my skin. Symptoms lasted for 30 seconds to less than a minute. Symptoms gradually reduced and once past the 15 minutes observation window, I mentioned these symptoms and asked if I was free to go. Since I felt alright and didn&#39;t need EMS to check with me, they let me drive back home. I have not experienced any other side effect post this event.

                                                Patient sat in the waiting area and soon she said she is feeling dizzy and  wants to lay down. Helped her get on the floor to lay down. She said she also had a vision black out. She was conscious throughout and said she is feeling better after laying down. This was her 2nd shot and she had done fine with that. She had not eaten for a while and then said she had similar reaction with the 3rd HPV shot. Took her BP and  it was normal. She laid on the back for a while and then sat in the chair with her feet elevated. After about 40 minutes she said she is doing fine and left.

Pt felt dizzy and then fainted for approximately 10-20 seconds in the chair as she was being held and regained consciousness. She was given cold compresses which helped tremendously and waited a total of 30-45 minutes to ensure no further adverse reactions. There were none and pt went home. Will follow up and call patient.

We gave her 50mg of Benadryl and sat her down to observe her. She said that her symptoms somewhat resembled what she experiences in an episode of POTS but she never had the tongue numbness or chest pain before.  When talking to us she could not make eye contact and her responses were slow but clear. Within the next 15 minutes her symptoms did not improve and she stated her right hand felt numb. We called 911. The EMTs said all her vitals were good but they took her to the closest ER.

We let her lay down and raised her feet and she said she felt better immediately.  She stayed at that position for about 20 minutes and  then sat and standed for a while until she was confident that she was fine and left the pharmacy.

A law enforcement officer witnessed her becoming faint and ran over to attend her. I was called over to assess her as well. The law enforcement officer called EMS. The patient stated that she felt faint, dizzy, she said she had a headache, blurry vision, and was nauseous. The patient appeared sweaty and she appeared to loose consciousness briefly twice. She did not show any signs of redness, rash, or swelling. After sitting for a few minutes, and before EMS arrived, the patient said she was improving. She did not lose consciousness anymore but she still had a headache, nausea, and blurry vision. When EMS arrived they recommended that she get checked out at the emergency room, but the patient refused stating that she did not want to go to the hospital and that she was feeling better. The patient called her parents and they came and picked her up.

This was my second shot, and the pain was not as bad but it still hurt to walk and I had to tiptoe around the day after. My feet are mostly better but are still painful and abnormally dry. This has never happened to me before.

                                                Patient recieved her first dose of Moderna. Within 10 minutes she was feeling dizzy and lightheaded. I lowered her to the floor and lifted her feet above her head.  An ice pack was applied to the back of her neck.  She started complaining  that her throat was closing up so an epi pen was administered and 911 called.  The epi pen was a temporary fix but her throat started closing up worse than before.  I administered a 2nd epipen.  Patient was violantly shivering. A  3rd epipen was administered with no relief.  At this time the paramedics arrived and she was transported to the hospital.

                                                Confusion/inability to complete tasks: within 20 minutes of getting my vaccine, I was unsafe to drive (drove on the wrong side of the road). Within 2 hours, I could no longer focus enough to work (I&#39;m an engineer). It&#39;s been 6 days since my shot and I&#39;m still confused, forgetful, unable to focus, and unsafe to drive. I forget steps during work tasks, and forget what I&#39;m doing while I&#39;m doing it. It&#39;s like a short term/prospective memory issue. Lack of coordination: 5 days after shot, could not navigate stairs without assistance. Could not remember ADL (did I get mail, did I eat, did I shower, day of week...) Fatigue: Slept/ rested all day for 2 days after the shot. It&#39;s now 6 days after the shot and I&#39;m still unusually tired, needing 2-6 extra hours of rest a day. It&#39;s tiring to walk short distances, to focus/converse, to work. Sore arm: my arm was very sore for 2 days after the shot (painful at rest, worse if touched, like a bruise). By 4 days after the shot, it was not sore even if pressed/hugged. I do not have any headache.

                                                Patient is a 25 year old female. She presented to the clinic for her second dose of Moderna LOT #003C21A.  According to patient&#39;s husband she has no significant past medical history but has ?passed out? with vaccines.  No reaction noted with her first COVID vaccine.  Approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection today she told her husband that she wasn?t feeling well.  She said was light headed and nauseated.  Patient then proceeded to become nonresponsive.  Her eyes deviated upward and her whole body became stiff.  Her skin had notable pallor.  She was lowered to the ground by staff, myself, and her husband, and put in a supine position with her legs elevated.  911 was called. This episode lasted approximately 40-60 seconds when she became responsive and cried out for husband.  Her muscles relaxed and she became notably upset.  She kept saying she wasn?t able to see or feel her extremities.  Her lack of vision resolved within 10-15 seconds. She had weakness in her arms and legs but was able to squeeze her hands on command.  She was alert and oriented X3.  BP was 130/90.  The patient was stable when the ambulance arrived to transport her to Hospital.

Then, started to have tinnitus in both ears for about a month, and now this has started to subside. Primary care doctor did basic lab workup and everything was normal. Went to ENT doctor and was given steroids, however elected not to take them. ENG showed horizontal nystagmus to both right and left side. Was told usually this sort of thing happens due to inflammation and is usually post-viral. However, there is a slight possibility it could be due to anything that causes inflammation (aka the vaccine).
