Unable to lift arm above shoulder without significant pain at about 12 hours post injection. About 13-14 hours post vaccine, began having myalgias, chills. Took ibuprofen with some improvement of symptoms, but unable to sleep due to the combination of arm pain, chills and aches. Body aches and chills were gone by the morning but the arm pain lingered, less than the night before and improving each day, still there today, but much more tolerable.

                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

Woke up in the morning with extreme headache and neck pain as well as pain in injection site. Took tylenol which did not help the pain or headache. Headache worsened until about noon, at which point I could not move due to neck/arm pain and headache. Symptoms dissipated quickly away pretty quickly around 1 PM

                                                It was noted during injection a tremendous amount of pain/stinging/burning that lasted a few minutes. About 20 minutes post injection, numbness/tingling noted in pinky/5th finger radiating down palm to wrist on same arm as injection as well as dizziness. Notified observation RNs and moved to a separate room. Mildly elevated BP but normal HR noted. No rash/hives/difficulty breathing. Numbness and tingling would migrate - most often to thumb but sometimes up entire arm. Released 1 hour after injection after no life threatening signs noted.  Visited PCP the next day (1/6) at 10:15. Professional opinion that it is due to swelling from injection - now noticeable area of swelling around injection site. Recommended ice and NSAIDs.

                                                At the time of vaccination, a burning sensation was felt immediately upon injection. The person who injected the vaccine proceeded to flick the plastic tubing of the syringe while it was still in my arm, escalating the burning sensation. I let the tech know about the burning and he claimed it could be a side effect of the medication and that I would be fine. I did not suffer any medication related side effects. Left arm stiffness began about two hours after vaccination and after nearly 3 hours, I was completely unable to move my arm. Loss of shoulder posture, complete arm/hand weakness and extreme arm soreness were reported for nearly 5 days. Numbness from the injection site down to the elbow is intermittent currently. Tingling down from the shoulder joint to the fingers is constant when arm is laterally raised or when overused. The left arm is still having trouble externally/internally rotating/raising above my head, and while lifting heavy objects. I&#39;m in the process of starting physical therapy/occupational therapy to regain normal strength and functioning without the tingling or pain. An audible clicking noise is noted that was not there previously to the injection. I am unable to exercise normally and have been functioning at a decreased work and paperwork pace at my job as a nuclear stress technician. I have also been losing days of time at work due to various doctor&#39;s appointments and diagnostic tests needed to identify the problem.

Pt. States she was tested for COVID 3 days prior to vaccine and this was negative. Pt. Says she had been sick for 6-7 days prior to taking vaccine and believes her immune system might of been weak from this.  She received Moderna COVID vaccine at hospital. Her symptoms were more persistent and with more intensity for the first 3-4 days but now the symptoms are more &#34;off and on.&#34;  Her headache is posterior and the dizziness is also &#34;more intermittent than before.&#34; Her headache is rated 4/10 at this time. She has taken OTC NSAIDS without much relief. The &#34;dizziness&#34; seems to occur randomly and is not aggravated by rapid positional changes. She does ingest moderate amounts of caffeine to boost her energy level while at work. She denies visual changes/focal weakness/discoordination/nausea/vomiting/abd pain/shortness of breath/wheezing. Pt. Reports that she has been very concerned about making sure she takes the right measures to help prevent getting COVID infection. She has researched the COVID vaccines, how they are made, and which are &#34;more potent.&#34;

She presented at a walk-in clinic and received Epi-Pen 0.3mg, Solu-Medrol and Benadryl, while there she received 2 additional doses and was transferred to the nearest ED by ambulance. At the ED  she received a 4th dose of Epi-Pen 0.3mg and albuterol and DuoNeb treatments. She was admitted for observation. She went home and needed to return within 24 hours to the ED because her lips and tongue started to swell and she turned blue. She subsequently needed 3 additional doses of Epi-Pen over the next 24-48 hours. She has been on Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours and Famodine 20mg until present.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. I have a growing red spot on my arm that itches. It is developing a red ring around it. It is itchy, but doesn&#39;t hurt. It only gets swollen if I itch it and it also gets hot when I itch it. I went and saw my doctor and she prescribed me a topical steroid cream. I have been feeling lightheaded, fatigued and dizzy. That started Thursday January 7.

Nurse administering vaccine noted injection was &#34;difficult to push.&#34; Five hours post vaccine began to feel severe pain in left arm. Pain worsened overnight. 36 hours later unable to use arm due to pain and numbness noted in fingertips of left hand.  Went to emergency room, both nurse and doctor assessed area and could see injection site and noted it was inappropriate - not into the deltoid rather into my shoulder joint. Discharged with pain medication. This AM (1/14) left shoulder pain still significant.

                                                Saturday- felt fine for a Couple of hours after vaccine. Felt fatigued around 4 PM, laid down, lost ability to move arm, extreme pain in neck.  Sunday- more of the same throughout the day. At night when I took a shower the pain moved over the course of a few minutes in the shower from my arm to my lower back. Arm was fine, Lower back pain bad enough that I was limping.  Monday- woke up &amp; pain was evenly dispersed between lower back and head. Slight soreness in arm and neck. Took extra strength ibuprofen because I had to work. Totally fine for the rest of the day time. At night my arm and neck started to become very sore again. After I ate dinner I developed a very intense fever, chills/ shakes, my arm felt like it had a heartbeat and my heart was racing. Laid in bed all night. Felt scared and disturbed that this was happening days after the vaccine. Considered going to the hospital but I couldn?t move. Slept for 10 hours.  Tuesday (today)- feeling almost all better aside from slight pain in neck.

I became extremely sweaty with chills and my entire left arm (side of injection) became numb and tingly. The episode lasted approximately 20 minutes, and I was symptom-free within an hour. I never fainted or vomited.

                                                I had slight dizziness for 20 minutes a half hour after the injection. But that&#39;s not the issue. When the lady gave me the injection, it felt like she wiggled it around in my arm. The injection itself was surprisingly painful. My arm hurt at first like I was punched in the arm on the first day (much like a flu vaccine). But then it got SIGNIFICANTLY worse the next day. I was in excruciating pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine. I had limited arm mobility and any movement caused agony. I couldn&#39;t sleep from the pain. I wasn&#39;t able to do my normal activities. The pain started to subside after 4 days, but had since started to get worse again. I&#39;m in a constant state of pain. It&#39;s now impacting my mental health. I can move my arm, but not without a lot of pain.

Later that morning I was light headed, fatigued, sore throat, nausea. The fever continued to increase. By 2200 that day my fever was 104.7 and that was with Tylenol on board. I also iced my groins and axillary areas to help cool my body. Today is the second day out from the vaccine and I have recovered from the fevers. My fever early this morning was still 102.5 but has since passed and I am normothermic. I am very fatigued with some chest pains.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

                                                about ten minutes after the second dose, i got dizzy, felt like my heart was pounding out of my chest, hives around the injection site, and my tongue went numb. after the nurses checked my vitals, my blood pressure was elevated, i was tachycardic, so they administered oral Benadryl. after an hour of being closely monitored i was cleared to go. the next day, i was still really dizzy, nauseous, had body aches and bad headaches. that saturday, i went to the er at hospital for the same symptoms just worsening and now at this point my lymphnodes under my left armpit were very large. they proceeded to do blood work, gave me 2 liters of fluids, iv zofran and iv pepsid. the blood work had no signs of infection and was completely normal. the doctor then sent me home with zofran to help with the nausea and pepsid 2 times dailey to try to get the lymph node to come down. 1/27/21 i returned back to the er for chest pains and still dizzy, body aches, and headaches. all chest x-rays, blood work, and ekg were normal and they sent me home. still today 1/28/21 i am still very dixxy, have body aches, bad headaches, nauseous, have no appetite, short of breathe when walking short distances, and have swollen lymph nodes.

                                                About 2 to 3 minutes after receiving my injection, I began to feel a burning sensation in my nostrils. It felt like a 4/10 pain. The burning sensation worsened when breathing through my nose. When trying breathing techniques to calm down (breathing deeply through the nose, exhaling out the mouth), the burning sensation deepened towards the back of my throat - but I never felt it in my lower throat and chest - only the top of my throat and nose.  The nurse on staff took me to a corner for closer evaluation. She had me remove my mask and checked my body for hives. I had no hives and the burning sensation occurred even after my mask was removed. She asked if I had trouble breathing or itchiness, I had neither of those symptoms. My heart rate was high and I began to hyperventilate because I was having a panic attack. I had no other symptoms besides the panic attack symptoms (tight chest, tingly face and hands, rapid heart rate, and dizziness) and the burning nostrils.  The sensation lasted about 5-10 minutes, then dissipated. I then put my mask back on after it was requested. I continued to be monitored by the nurse for another 20 minutes until I gained back my normal breathing and my heart rate lowered. I was scheduled for a 2nd dose and was dismissed with no other treatment or issues. I drove myself back home and rested for the remainder of the day.  I had no other symptoms that day, other than the typical sore arm, fatigue, and mild chills, which resolved themselves in a couple days. I had no other complications.

                                                At 3am (Wednesday) the following day after my shot, I began having chills and a fever. My fever started at 100.5 and continued through out the entire day, reaching 102. degrees Fahrenheit. At the same time I was extremely weak and could hardly walk. I had a pounding headache and could not sit up. I had to lay down. I was very nauseous and couldn&#39;t eat much. I was dizzy and couldn&#39;t even look at my phone. at 9pm on Wednesday I was able to finally eat a substantial meal and finally took some Tylenol. Around 10:30pm my headache lessened and I was able to sit up. My temperature was around 99 degrees. I went to bed, then woke up at 1am (Thursday) freezing again with chills, then the sweats. By 3:45am I was able to sleep until 7am. 7am on Thursday morning my temperature was normal (98.6) but my head was hurting. I had some weakness but was able to stand long enough to shower. The biggest symptom I had all day Thursday was a lot of body aches. Mostly in my hips and back, but all over. My right arm was also extremely red and swollen. Wednesday and Thursday I stayed home from work. Friday I returned to work, but I had a headache, would get over heated easily and had body aches. This is when the injection site and surrounding area began itching. Saturday I had a stomach ache and head ache and continued to feel sluggish. I did not move around much and was exacerbated trying to grocery shop. Sunday I had pressure in my head (top of the head) especially when I would bend down.  It is now Monday. My headache has cleared but my arm remains itchy, though there is no sign of swelling or redness. I do not have a history of Chronic Migraines and I have not had a cold/the flu in over a year.

                                                Experienced an increase in heart rate from 10 p.m. on 1/26/2021 for approximately 24 hours. According to the data on my fitness band, my heart rate averaged at 130 bpm during sleep and rest, and was approximately 170 bpm when standing despite taking metoprolol succinate. I usually take 12.5mg of the metoprolol, and took another 12.5 mg the morning of 01/27/2021, which seemed to help with the increase in heart rate. Despite normally experiencing an increase in heart rate due to my diagnosis of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia, my heart rate usually drops into the 60&#39;s at night and during the day if I am moving, is about 120-130 bpm. Additionally on 01/28/2021, I had difficulty standing due to feeling faint and dizzy upon standing. All symptoms appeared to resolve by 01/29/2021. Besides taking extra medication, I spent the day resting and hydrating with water.

My throat started to hurt really bad and I felt like I could not breathe I looked in my mouth and my tonsils were swelling  and I had to give myself an epi pen so I could breathe. Went home called my doctor and told him what happen I was very flushed, headache, sore throat cough, and I started to warm up several hours later to 100.9. He told me to take steroids I was given when I had COVID and told me if I start to have other symptoms to go to the emergency room. He also said since I recently had gotten COVID I was not suppose to get the second vaccine yet.

The morning following the injection I had moderate - severe upper arm pain at and around the injection site leading to impaired mobility and limited ability to use my arm. I also felt nauseous, had a headache, dizziness, and general malaise. I took Tylenol and my symptoms began to improve. The arm pain is still present but is slowly improving.

                                                Really sore arm, very hard to lift. Other vaccines would feel like a &#34;normal&#34; type of sore, but this time my arm was extremely sore for about 2 to 3 days. Also, both armpits were sore. The opposite underarm was only sore for 1 day. However, the underarm of the same injection arm was sore for a week and a half.

As soon as I felt queezy I passed out. I woke up they said within about 30 seconds and had full body sweats. Stomach ache, dizzy and head was tingly like I would pass out again. My calfs hurt like they had previously had muscle cramps. I went to ER, blood and urine tests were fine, heart and blood pressure was fine. Dr said he did not believe it was an allergic reaction, and that it was a stress response. I am not sure if it is because I had COVID in December.

                                                Arm pain began in early afternoon with skin tenderness beginning in the evening, which were followed by extreme chills, body aches that hurt to be still, muscle spasms, fever (102-101.4), throbbing headache (treated with ibuprofen x2 200mg Q4hr which helped some), then around 12am became hot and sweaty with aches and spasms persisting. Was able to sleep off and on every time I turned over onto my vaccine arm I woke because of the pain. Next morning I spent the day in bed with lingering chills, muscle aches, headache, and spasms, but less than night before. High Fever persisted (101.4) and a cough with mild shortness of breath developed. The night of 2/28 I took ibuprofen (same dose as before) and Benadryl which allowed me to sleep all night. This morning (3/1) I feel better, with fatigue, lightheaded, a mild fever of  99.3, and minimal muscle aches. Cough persists.

                                                Around 6 pm I got a severe headache, very bad body aches, trouble breathing, and a very fast heart rate. I felt faint and had cold sweats so I went to ER after work. The ER doctor gave me fluids, a vial of tylenol through IV, and just observed me to make sure my heart rate and blood pressure came down. They said it sounded like a normal reaction. Fever of 101. I am getting a MRI of my brain on Tuesday 3/9/21 for continued severe headaches.

No appetite. Struggled to read and process things. Could not work. Sharp pains in lymph nodes at various times throughout the day. Chest felt very tight and arm hurt to the point I thought I might be having a heart attack. Had trouble sleeping due to lymph node pain. Ibuprofen did not help. The arm pain at injection site was annoying but I barely noticed it due to my other symptoms.

Staff reported her slumping over in a chair. Prior to the vaccination she informed the vaccinator she has had episodes of fainting with vaccination in the past notably to Gardasil.The vaccinator who was a physician lowered her to the ground in a trendelenburg  position with her legs up in a chair. Patient quickly regained consciousness with a pulse of 65. She appeared pale, diaphoretic, but alert and oriented x4.  She was provided with a cold pack, apple juice and crackers. She was helped into a wheelchair , taken to the post vaccination area and observed for 30 mins by this writer who is a nurse.  She called a friend  to drive her home.

                                                Starting about 1 minute after vaccination I became extremely dizzy, blacked out/lost vision, had shortness of breath and a tight chest, lost feeling in my hand and fingers on my left side (the side I got the vaccine), was sweating but felt cold flowing through my body. These feelings lasted for about 30 minutes and my vision and feeling in my fingers and hand came back as the dizziness subsided and my body temp returned to normal.   Around 40 minutes after the vaccine I started experiencing echoing in my left ear (the side I got the vaccine on) and soreness around the vaccination site.   The echoing in my left ear lasted about 30 minutes and then subsided. The arm pain spread to the rest of my arm and I began to get a headache.  About 4 hours after the vaccine I began to experience intense back, hip, foot and hand pain making me unable to do any regular activities. The back pain feels like intensely sharp pain in my spine and hurts to the gentle touch. I previously had no back pain prior to the vaccine. The muscles surrounding my spine up to my shoulders were also painful/sore.  This pain subsided after 6 days. On about the 4th day after the vaccine I began experiencing underarm and breast pain on the side I got the vaccine.  It is now exactly 1 week since my vaccination and I am still experiencing the underarm and breast pain.  I have experienced lethargy since vaccination.

She sat down, was given ice pack for back of neck, instructed to put head down between legs and rest.  After talking to patient, she had eaten some after her shot, she was well hydrated.  She has had no previous major adverse effects from shot, aside from sometimes sore arm.  She is alert, communicative, and aware of her surroundings when I spoke to her.   At 2:17pm, patient is feeling a bit better, but still has lessened but similar SE.  Also, reports she has a bit of headache now.  Another coworker has offered to drive her home and she has her grandmother at home to watch her too.  Advised her to rest at home, take tylenol if headache persists, stand up and sit down carefully, and drink chicken soup until nausea is over.

While I was driving home around 1:00 pm my left arm started to tingle, I got really hot and a wave of lightheaded/dizziness washed over me and I couldn?t swallow. I pulled over to wait it out and my throat swelling got worse.

                                                12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn&#39;t cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn&#39;t much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn&#39;t in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn&#39;t seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.

                                                I am still not certain whether or not this is related to the vaccine, but it is very coincidental so I wanted to reach out just in case. I plan on seeing a physician this week if possible, but I am new to the area and do not have a PCP here so trying to get in to see someone is not very easy, and I do not feel that this is an emergency yet. Since Sunday night when I had the vaccine I am getting soreness in the muscles all over my body and have joint stiffness and pain, mostly legs, arms, and lower back. It is worse when I rest (sitting or laying) for extended periods of time. It relieves somewhat with NSAIDs but on some days it is so painful, stiff, and sore that I have difficulty going up and down stairs, and even walking or rolling over in bed sometimes. The last three days or so I have developed red and purple macules that first began on both of my legs and are now starting on both of my arms as well. Other than feeling fatigued and what I have described already, these are my symptoms. Like I said, I am not sure if it is related to the vaccine or not yet, but it did start the same day with the soreness. It has progressively gotten worse throughout the week and that is why I am now trying to seek help from a PCP. I may also try to reach out to my allergist on Monday when they reopen.

                                                I had fatigue and body aches after about 2 hours following the injection. I also had severe muscle and joint pain in the arm I received the injection in for about 2 days following the injection. I could not sleep on my arm, had difficulty lifting it over my head, and still experience some tenderness when I rub my upper arm.  I have never experienced this much pain following a vaccination in my entire life.

                                                I took Benadryl before this dose per my allergist. About 3 minutes after the dose I felt a little light headed and dizzy that shortly resolved. About 10 minutes after that, I became light headed and dizzy again along with chest tightness, palpitations and an itchy throat. My heart rate was in the 110s. My symptoms would be on and off. I received more Benadryl in the ED with no resolution. I then was given an epi pen and prednisone. After this the itchy throat and light headedness resolved. I was observed in the ED for a total of 4 hours. I was discharged with 4 days of prednisone and 2 days of Benadryl.

The next morning I woke up and couldn&#39;t move my head or neck from debilitating pain. I was not able to sit or stand on my own, and I could not walk more than a few steps without needing to sit down and rest. Severe upper back, neck and head pain for 3 days. Some intermittent irregular heartbeat, chest tightness as well. I lost 8 pounds (123lbs to 115lbs) in two days.

                                                The two days following the injection, I could not move my left arm. The pain was very intense and any movement or motion would create a sharp pain.  There was a slight swelling at the injection site, but nothing else visible. On the third day after the injection, upon waking up, I regained mobility of the arm.  After I receive flu shots, I will sometimes get a dull ache in my arm for the rest of the day, but this was much more intense and much more painful.   Yesterday, exactly one week after the injection, I began to develop a large rash at the injection site. It is itchy, swollen, and warm to the touch.  I have not experienced this previously with other vaccines so I am going to watch it closely.  I do not know for sure whether the rash is related to the vaccine itself, the injection, or the band-aid used afterwards. I will sometimes have a reaction to the adhesive on some types of band-aids, but that reaction is typically  instantaneous and does not itch.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

                                                The day of my arm was very sore and did not want to lift more than halfway up. The following day, I woke up with a very sore arm. By about 2pm I had body aches and a small fever. The second day, I was headachy with a sore arm.   the third day, Sunday, my arm was no longer sore, but my armpit hurt to move. At first it felt like a bra poke, but it would not go away. Monday and Tuesday, the irritant was high, but not painful. I believe this to be from a swollen lymph node. It currently feels like someone left a marble under my armpit.

                                                Within 1.5 hours, I started getting a bad headache.  She was not hungry, was nauseated and was becoming clammy.  She tried to eat but it did not make it better.  When she got home, she continued to feel &#34;really bad like she was getting over the flu.&#34;  She slept for over 10 hours.  When she got up, she could not move her arm and her arm was sore at the injection (it was hard, a little swelling but was not red).  Then she started feeling worse with bad pain (like she had a stroke).  This was around 12 noon to 1 PM on 1/21/21.  Around 7 PM that night, she presented to the ER.  The ER doctor said he thought she was having a migraine but she has never had one before.  Her blood pressure was high at 127/110.  Her supervisor walked into the room and said her face was pulling and it looked like a stroke to her.  She reported severe pain from her ear to her neck on the right side of her head.  She left due to having to provide care to her newborn.  She went to hospital on 1/21/21 about 2100.   Her blood pressure was still high and she had a heart rate of 120 bpm.  She did lab work and CT scan.   ER doctor believed she was experience Bell&#39;s Palsy and that she had had a mini-seizure.  She provided prednisone 60 mg X 1 dose, Valtrex tid and shot of Toradol.  She prescribed Toradol for outpatient pain relief.

At 3am, I woke up with fever, chills, a migraine, dizziness and lightheadedness that prevented me from walking without assistance. I began feeling pain while breathing and was very weak when standing. My fever reached 102.9 while taking Tylenol. The body aches and Migraine were a 10/10. I went to hospital where they treated my migraine and the benedryl seemed to ease much of my pain and dizziness related to the vaccine. I was told I was having a vaccine reaction.

I also had a very mild headache shortly after receiving the shot. This has come and gone within the last 12-15hours (since I received the shot). I also started experiencing mild chills at about hour 15 after receiving the shot. I?m having a very difficult time sleeping due to the discomfort.

                                                After receiving moderna vaccine administration, we requested pt to wait at least 30 minutes prior to leaving the pharmacy. After 30 minutes, we came back to give the pt her vaccination card and as soon as she stood up, she fell slowly onto the floor and started having seizure (pt didn&#39;t hit her head per technician on scene) around 3:50 pm and became unconscious for a few seconds. She was able to answer our questions when she woke up, but was confused of where she at. She continued to call out random names.  We called the ambulance and assisted her while she was on the floor.  She had another seizure 5 minutes after the first seizure and became unconscious again for a few more seconds.

                                                I received the second dose of my Moderna covid vaccine at 10 am on Wednesday February 3rd. Around 8:30 pm I experienced extreme chills and had a 100-101 F fever all night. I woke in the morning still feeling weak because I spent the whole night uncomfortable from the fever and flushed  face I had. I walked towards another part of my house and fell down and fainted. I was unconscious for a few seconds before a family member was able to shake me and wake me up. I take no medications and am a generally healthy individual with no prior medical history or underlying Heath conditions. I also do not have a history of falls or issues from taking any past vaccines. I also am not allergic to anything or have experienced any allergic reactions in my life. It?s the second day now and I am still experiencing a 100 Degree fever and face flushing. I am currently self medicating at home with Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not gone to see a health care professional yet.

These symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes and then they resolved. I did not have any of these symptoms since it initially happened on 1.8.21 at 230am. I did not seek medical care at the time since my symptoms resolved. I did contact my doctor on 2.1.2021 about this and he stated the symptoms I described aligned with symptoms of a panic attack, but if I felt it was related to the vaccine that I can report it.

At 1:30 AM on 2/13, I woke from sleep with severe epigastric pain, chest pain, and pain between my shoulder blades. My arm (where I received the vaccine) was throbbing and I had severe under arm pain on the same side. Symptoms lessened with 2 extra strength Tums, 500 mg Tylenol, and 30 mL of Pepto, but were still present. I was able to sleep, I woke up later in the morning with these persistent symptoms, as well as fatigue. All of these symptoms continued for 24h. On 2/14, I had lessened arm pain and fatigue but continued to have epigastric/chest/back pain. I was seen at the urgent care near me and my physical was normal, they indicated that the chest symptoms were likely from epigastric pain since I was not having shortness of breath. I?ve continued to have these seemingly random chest pains and back pains, they?re very intense throbbing sharp pains in my chest and back that do not always coincide with exercise or stress.

                                                At 8 pm the day I had the shot I started having a headache and muscle aches on both hips. The following day I was nauseous, light-headed, had a headache, muscle aches around my hips, pain at injection site, and was weak. I passed out for an unknown amount of time around 11 am that Sunday. I was unable to eat more than two pieces of pilot bread, but I kept drinking water and was hydrated. I kept rolling around trying to get comfortable, but the muscle pains in my hips would not let me until I used a heating pd. The following day I was weak, but no longer as nauseous or have as bad a headache.  On Tuesday, I was able to get up, but both arms felt very weak and it was a strain to carry my bag and computer. Wednesday I was still very tired, but more like myself. No symptoms today February 18.

                                                Spells of extreme dizziness/vertigo about 2 hours after the vaccination; it subsided about 10 hours after vaccination. Sharp pain in the chest/side/back (opposite the arm it was injected in) but I am also guessing this was stress related pain as I was very nervous about the vaccine (wanted to report anyway just in case) the pain subsides with 400mg ibuprofen. Then swelling, redness, and itchiness at the vaccination site starting the next day (3/6) and growing in intensity after (today). Currently the swelling is about 1.5 inches in diameter, it does not seem serious so I&#39;ll be treating it with topicals to ease the itching.

She stated she had history of fainting following blood draws and other vaccinations but did not tell vaccinating nurse this.  EMS called. Client refused transport.  She was monitored another 30 minutes and left after fluids and a snack.

Shortly after, I had a large swollen area that was very hot, painful, and tender. I had limited movement of my arm for approximately one week. Since my second dose, I have a large dent in my arm that will not go away. It stays semi-warm.

The rash appeared when I woke  up at 8am, and by 11am my face was swollen and red. I did not have any breathing issues. My face swelling subsided within a few hours. The next day on Sunday 3/20/21, the rash on my left upper arm at the injection site has disappeared, but the hives and swelling of the toes have worsened.

                                                On April 15, I noticed a pain in my right armpit. It was an achey sore pain, but also a more sharp, prominent pain at certain times. So I think it was a swollen lymph node. But by April 18 and 19, it only hurts when I raise my arm.   And also on April 15, my right arm was little itchy at the injection site, but I didn?t think anything of it. But by April 17, my whole upper right arm was very itchy, red, and warm to the touch. This has continued for the past few days. It?s not all the time, but a few times throughout the day and it lasts for probably a half hour to an hour.

Then about 3 hours after I received the vaccine I started having nausea and some hand tingling on and odd. The biggest limiting symptom was the excruciating shoulder pain on the left arm, no relief with ibuprofen, Tylenol, ice, changing position nothing. Worse pain I had in my life. I could not move my arm on its own at all and it was excruciating pain. Went to the ER and they gave me IV fluids and tramadol. The pain was better after that but I still could not move the arm and the pain was still present. They made me follow up with my PCP. I saw my PCP on a Tuesday after being on and off the phone with them on a Mondays.  Symptoms have improved but not back to normal.

                                                &#34;I received my first dose of the covid vaccine yesterday, January 4th around 3pm. I have not felt any major symptoms or side effects aside from pain at the injection site. This afternoon I noticed how sore my arm was and started looking up potential side effects of the vaccine to see how long I should expect pain. I was trying to practice lifting my sore arm and then started feeling light headed. My vision went blurry, my hearing was muffled, and I started to feel like I was going to faint and/or vomit. I tried drinking water to see if that would help and when it didn&#39;t I called over to my coworker to tell her I felt like I was going to pass out. She informed our boss, who called Employee Health. They both walked me downstairs to Employee Health.&#34;

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning her co-worker, a 28 year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced anaphylaxis reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                The day after and the next day were filled with extreme exhaustion, dizziness, joint pain, and headache.  I started to feel better until Jan 11, where I had extreme exhaustion, worse joint pain, extreme muscle aches and stiffness, worse headache, and the worst nausea.  Since Jan 11, I haven&#39;t been able to eat much.  The V-safe check in skipped the worst days so far.

After a couple hours, the pain became unbearable, and she had an ED physician look at her arm. She had limited use of her arm on Monday 1/11 and Tuesday 1/12. Wednesday 1/13 her arm started to feel better and she could lift it. She went to her PCP and he said the injection site looked higher than it should have been. Today 1/14 she still has sharp pain with movement and limited range of motion.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

                                                I got the vaccine approx 10:10am yesterday. About 4 hours post-vaccine, I developed severe pain in my left arm which limited flexion and adduction. I started to become nauseous, but initially thought this was due to pain. Once I returned home from work, at approximately 5 PM, I started to develop chills and a worsening headache. After taking acetaminophen, I took my temperature and found it was 101.5. This remained all night, and I had a difficult time sleeping, waking with chills, sweats and Aching in my joints. Today, I took off from work and slept all day, waking occasionally with the sweats. My fever began to go down slowly and is now approx 99.7 with use of fever reducers every 6 hours. Headache is still present. I anticipate these will dissipate in another day or two.

                                                I was speaking on the phone while getting the vaccine. Within 30 seconds of administration, my hands and feet immediately went cold and numb and dropped my phone on the floor. I blacked out for 2 seconds. (I was told I also flailed my arms and legs as it happened, this I do not remember). Following this, my heart rate was fast and blood pressure were elevated. I felt extremely dizzy for about 90 minutes following. It took approximately an hour for me to get taken to the emergency department.

All through the evening and the next day patient continued to have paresthesias and hypoesthesia in the arm and hands.  Immediately after the injection she began to feel dizzy but drank gatoraid once she got home and began to feel better.  Within an hour she started to have some mild numbness around her mouth and tongue.  The next day she still has some mild numbness around the mouth and some tingling of her tongue.  She has had similar issues before due to fibromyalgia and has had a malar rash that comes and goes and has tested positive for lupus in the past.

Within 3 hours I had strong pain and limited range of motion.By day 4, after a few days of rest at home, the pain had resolved so I came to work Monday night 1/4/2021. By the end of shift my arm was very sore again and I had a lot of pain when trying to lift it. My shoulder, neck, and back has a general ache and soreness on the left side that sometimes radiates down the arm and worsens when I try to lift my arm. Seen by ortho.

The rash persisted for 3-4 days before disappearing.  The rash reappeared immediately after the administration of the 2nd dose of the vaccine. I became flushed and dizzy during observation and was kept for a longer observation period. My vitals were normal and I was cleared by a nurse after drinking some water and apple juice. The rash has persisted and is about 4 inches in diameter at this time and remains painful and swollen.

Thought she needed food, then got the headache and chills.  For the entire night she did have the cold chills.  She went to work the following day and her skin started feeling tingly.  By the time she got home on 2/3/21 she felt nauseous, had temp of 101.8.  The whole night she pretty much swim in sweat.  She went to work and was sent home due to the fever, nonstop sweating, and fatigue feeling like she was going to pass out.  Around 12:00 PM on 2/4/21 she couldn&#39;t keep anything down, she lost 5# since this vaccine.   She took an Ibuprofen 800 which didn&#39;t do much.  She took Pepto-Bismol, Advil and could not hold anything down.   The brain pounding headache that didn&#39;t want to go away yesterday.  She is still having a headache, she feels like every step she takes she has to use the restroom due to diarrhea episodes.  She has been at home trying to sleep through the symptoms and has not seen a doctor as when she called with her first vaccine reactions they did not have any information to tell her since the side effects are so new.  She only gets up today only when she has to use the restroom.  She has been in the bed since she went home on 2/3/21.

The following day, 1/6/21, saw a PA for the blisters and hives due to the itchiness and hydrocortisone was not helping.  Then had a headache, body aches and flushes for at least a week.  She did have shortness of breath and by the weekend she was feeling confused like the feeling of waking up from anesthesia.  She started loosing her balance, could not go up the stairs, trip and fall.  They did lab work, told her that she was fine.  She was having confusion and forgetful and let it run it&#39;s course.  She did have the 2nd vaccine, but is still having hot flushes from it.

                                                Arm pain started at 4:30pm the day of the injection. As the evening continued, I had muscle and joint aching of left side of my neck, shoulder, breast and felt very fatigued. During the night, I fell asleep quickly but woke up between 12-2 am sweating, with chills and muscle and joint aching all over my body specifically in my spine. The next morning I woke up with severe left arm pain and was unable to lift my left arm but I believe that is possibly due to the location of the injection site. (They injected me much closer to the AC joint rather than in the bulky part of the muscle.) The arm pain lasted 2 nights. I continued feeling fatigued and drained through the first full day and woke up after the second night feeling better. I had mild headaches on and off starting the second day after the injection and lasting about 5 days.

                                                On 2/4/21 after receiving my second dose,I started having some minor itching at the injection site when I returned home from the appointment around 7:30pm. On 2/5/21, the injection site was painful, red, very swollen, firm and raised. I also had accompanying symptoms of chills, dizziness, and a headache. Over night I experienced a hot flash lasting a couple of hours. On 2/6/21, the injection site looks bigger, is raised  and firm, hot to the touch, and painful. I still have a slight headache and dizziness. I have taken Tylenol through the course of the past few days which has helped the headache. I have also tried icing the spot for swelling and it continues to remain hot to the touch. I believe my symptoms are associated with Covid arm.

                                                The second dose was very painful, compared to no pain when the first dose was given one month ago. My arm was immediately hot and tender after administration. The area around the injection site had less feeling than the rest of my arm - it felt almost numb. My arm was very sore and warm the rest of the evening. I began having fatigue, muscle aches, and joint pain last night as well. I woke up around 6 this morning and the room was spinning. I was also nauseous. I tried to roll over in bed but was unable to feel my arms and legs. I was also temporarily unable to see. Right after, I passed out and lost urinary continence. I regained consciousness a minute later and had normal functioning again. I have not had any more dizziness today but am still sore and fatigued.

Additionally, the arm was red and swollen at injection site. On 2/8, I have continued to feel fatigued, weak, with mild body aches, no fever or chills, but still feeling weak. As of 13:05 on 2/8, I am feeling better, but still not 100%. I had previously had all these symptoms with the first shot except the swelling and redness at the injection site, that was new. With the first dose, it took approximately 3-4 days for me to return to feeling normal.

She was taken by EMS to the  Emergency Department and evaluated, here it was discovered that she has a history of nonepileptic seizure episodes and the Physician Assistant providing care did not think this episode was &#34;measureable allergic reaction to her vaccination however perhaps the stress and worry of having this shot just prior to her symptoms&#34;.  Followed up with the employee today and she is having expected side effects from vaccine administration (body aches, fever up to 102-103, and headache), no further seizure like activity.

Then I could barely move because of my body aches, started getting a fever in the middle of the night. I was taking Tylenol and Advil all night to help with the fever and body aches. My lymph nodes in my inner thigh were so sore, it felt like someone had punched me there. I was basically in a fetal position for next 12 hours after coming home.

                                                No initial pain after injection. Body aches, headache and muscle soreness around midnight. Woke up around 4-5a.m. to neck/head pain, tense muscles on head/neck and notable pains in the jugular region. Very sensitive skin and muscle aches at this time. getting up to grab ibuprofen caused initial worsening of head pains that quickly subsided as blood pressure issue(?) symptoms came on (blotchy vision, lightheadedness, notably diminished hearing). took around 20 minutes to realize head/neck pain seemed to be caused by stiffness from an unusual amount of intense teeth grinding in my sleep. Waited around an hour and a half while drinking plenty of water and taking a single dose of ibuprofen along with a second dose of clonazepam before feeling comfortable/safe enough to go back to sleep.

                                                I am twenty-eight years old, young, healthy active girl. I have always been into fitness and yoga. I live a generally healthy lifestyle. I have been a singer, a dancer, and a flight attendant! I decided sign up for the COVID-19 vaccine in order to help our world fight against this pandemic. I wanted to protect my family and friends to eradicate this virus once and for all. It was with no hesitation did I jump at the opportunity to get this vaccine when it became available to me on February 12th, 2021 at the Convention Center. As soon as I received my shot I proudly posted my photo with tears in my eyes letting the world know that we were one human closer to a COVID-19 free world. I was Moderna proud.   My entire family had already received their Moderna vaccines because I come from a family of nurses, but none of them had experienced any side effects. I was confident I would be in the clear after their clear symptom free vaccine. Immediately following my vaccine my arm was a little sore, as expected. However, I did experience fatigue and mild leg cramps in my calves. One very odd symptom was that I could taste the vaccine in my mouth, like a metallic, strange taste, which I reported to my family, but everyone just laughed it off. The leg cramps went away after a day or two as well as the taste, but the fatigue continued throughout the week. I felt these symptoms were pretty average. I signed up for the V-Safe reporting system and put in my report and thought nothing of my initial vaccine symptoms.   Things took a very strange turn on the morning of February 20th, 2021 at about 10am. I woke up and my face was numb, tingling all over, twitching in different parts of my face pretty severely and uncontrollably. By 4pm the tingling moved into both of my arms and hands and by 5pm it moved into both of my legs. Shortly after the cramping and twitching began in both of my legs and I lost the ability to walk, lift my legs, and just the ability to feel my legs at all. I could not walk.  Obviously concerning, I thought I was originally having a reaction to a medication I had been taking for over a year called, Topamax, a nerve pain medication which can cause numbness and tingling as a side effect. I called my prescribing physician and he immediately ruled out the possibility of a reaction to this medication due to the length of time I had been on this medication, that I had not missed a dose, I had not increased or decreased the dose, and I had not experienced a reaction like this in the time that I had been taking the medication. He recommended I keep an eye on my symptoms and go to an emergency room if things worsen.   Overnight, my symptoms remained the same. I woke up on Sunday, February 21st, 2021 and I still could not walk, I could not feel my legs. My legs were still twitching and cramping. My face was still numb and tingling, but the twitching had stopped in the face. My hands had stopped tingling. At this point my mother who is a nurse suggested that I call Moderna, the vaccine provider, to report a possible side effect of the vaccine. Upon contacting Moderna, the company thought that it could possibly be a reaction between the Topamax medication and the vaccine, but they had no current information about these two having any interactions. They thanked me for reporting and told me to go to an emergency room if my symptoms continued or worsen.   Throughout the day on Sunday, February 21st, my symptoms remained. I was able to get to my feet, but I walking like a newborn baby giraffe or as my mother described, like a 105 year old woman. I was unable to feel my legs completely, lift them, move them without lifting them with physical help of my arms moving them. At this point on Sunday night I decided to contact my Primary Care Physician. She noted that this sounded similar to Guillain-Barre and that I sound immediately go to an Emergency Department before the symptoms get any worse. It was late on a Sunday night and I was unable to drive myself, so I waited.   Overnight on Sunday into Monday I began experiencing light flashes in my eyes, heart races, lower back pain, and worsening cramping in my legs. I knew that I needed to seek treatment in an emergency room.   On Monday, February 22nd, 2021 I was taken to the Emergency Room Department. They conducted blood work and a physical examination, but did not want to proceed with any MRI?s or CAT scans. The ER the doctors were baffled. They could not figure out what was causing my paralysis other than the vaccine was the only new thing that had been introduced to my body, but they could not verify or diagnose anything. They let me go with a referral to neurology.   While we were sitting in the ER my cousin, a nurse anesthetist at another local hospital, called my mother who was with me with some very alarming news. Her co-worker, had experienced the same symptoms back in December and was just going through recovery after his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by the CDC there had been 19 reported cases through the CDC where after the first dose of the vaccine people have reported numbness, tingling, and the lose of the ability to walk after receiving the first dose of the mRNA vaccine, both Moderna and Pfizer. Her co-worker was also in the same age range as myself, very healthy, young, active. He was officially diagnosed with Transverse Myletis. He has taken a full two months to regain the ability to walk and still has numb patches on his legs. He walks very slowly, but is walking. He returned to work, but cannot return to his normal life working out and being active because he does not have the strength. He was told not to get the second dose of the vaccine.   There are unreported cases in this area by physicians who do not know where to turn with this information. It is hard to link these symptoms and cases because they are so obscure, but these same symptoms are occurring with those who have also had COVID-19. When I was being seen for an EMG test of my legs the physician performing the test said to us, ?I have a patient who received the vaccine and has the symptoms, maybe I should report it!?. My Grandmother?s physician just last week just sent a patient of hers with the same symptoms to neurology. I think this uncommon side effect is more common than is being reported and no one knows where to turn with the information.   I finally got into the head of Neurology. I was told, ?it?ll probably get better?, basically saying that they don?t know what they can do and they are at a loss for knowing what this is and why this is happening to people after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. Doctors don?t have answers and the vaccine companies aren?t offering information to help link these side effects together. The physician told me not to proceed with the second dose of the vaccine due to neurological side effect that I have had. I should benefit from the first dose and it is not safe for me to get the second dose from this side effect.   I was unable to walk for weeks since this began on Feb. 20th. It is just now that this week I am slowly able to move my legs, but they are still very numb and heavy. I haven?t been able to drive or live my normal life. I cannot use stairs, walk long distances, stand for very long periods of time. I am twenty-eight years old and I walk like an eighty year old woman, wobbly.   I have reported my case to CDC, V-SAFE, Moderna. The CDC said they would be in contact with me due to my report of extreme adverse side effects via the V-SAFE report, but I have not heard anything from them as of today.  These are the uncommon side effects that need to be heard and reported. I don?t know why they are being ignored because I have been left without answers and without hope.

As well as my arm at the site of injection. My temp was 99.8. I took  one tylenol around 8:30 am. As the day went on it got worse. I took one tylenol at 10:30 am. I was nauseous, my heart was racing, I felt like I was going to pass out, my arms and legs began to tingle. My temperature peaked at 102.5 around 5pm. All of my joints ached severely. It felt like my pelvis had been crushed. Even laying my knees on top of each other while laying on my side was too much pressure on my knee joints. The only other time I&#39;ve felt like this is when I had Influenza A. At 8:30 pm I took one tylenol and one benadryl and was finally able to sleep. A few hours after taking the medication the joint pain had greatly decreased.  In the morning I no longer had a fever.

It has not caused me any pain or discomfort until today when I noticed it was very warm to the touch and a little sore. It is about 3 inches long and is very oddly shaped. Today it almost feels like a bruise on my arm and is a little sore when I lift or move my arm. I have not taken any medication or sought medical treatment in regards to it. It if becomes more painful and swollen, then I will call my doctor right away.

                                                I had fatigue, headaches, SOB, dizziness. I had a routine check up already scheduled and was seen at that appointment. My blood pressure was elevated; 148/106 at the time of my appointment. I was sent to Labor and Delivery to be seen, I had my blood pressure continued to be high so my OB admitted me. I was induced without complication. My baby was born early but is healthy and home. I had a normal pregnancy up until Dose 2 of the vaccine. I had an estimated date of 03/17/2021 but delivered on 02/26/2021.

                                                Patient had appointment at 9:20 am. She was fine during the check in process, while receiving the imz and the 15 mins post vaccination wait time. Approx 10 am she left the IMZ room and about halfway through the store, she fainted. CSM said the fell outside of patient&#39;s room and did not seem to hit her head or neck. 911 wasn&#39;t called because she came to right away. They got her water and a chair. I was brought over approx 10:10 am. I talked with her and she seemed cognitive, lucid and understands who she is, where she is and what happened. She said she waited the 15 min and felt totally fine but then she got up and fell about halfway through store. Approx 10:20 am we brought her over to pharmacy area for more privacy and RPH checked her BP. reported 130/90. I asked patient if she wanted the paramedics called just in case of a head injury. I asked her before palpating her head and neck. She said she felt no pain, no visible bleeding or lacerations, no inflammation or redness and she has full mobility in her neck with no pain. Patient said she did not want paramedics called and instead called her mother in law who lives nearby to see if they can come get her. She is worried about  40 min drive home. Pt overall physically seemed fine. She was just shaken, nervous and embarrassed as she&#39;s never had something like this happen before. She waited for about 20 mins until her father in law came and picked her up. I updated him of the situation and they left together.

                                                Pain immediately upon completion of injection, with slight tingling in hand. Within 2 minutes of injection, pain was experienced at site of injection in the arm. Within 30 minutes of injection, arm had very limited range of motion resulting in inability to lift arm away from myself and severe pain. Discussed symptoms with pharmacist at clinic and was told if symptoms do not improve within 4 days, contact doctor and to take ibuprofen for symptoms in the meantime. Contacted PCP 2 hours post injection due to how severe pain was and was told pain was normal and should clear up. 24 hours post injection- symptoms still remained - very limited range of motion of arm and severe pain at site of injection and surrounding area in arm and into shoulder and neck. 48 hours post injection- pain less severe and increased range of motion in arm. 72 hours post injection- slight increase from 48 hours in terms of range of motion and slight decrease of pain. Currently still monitoring symptoms and taking ibuprofen.

                                                Had chills all night. Severe headache and body aches started around 10pm (vaccination was around 11am). I felt great for a few hours immediately following vaccination but developed severe light-headedness that evening. Passed out the following morning (01/01/2021) and my daughter called 911/ paramedics. I declined going to the hospital but I still feel horribly dizzy and ache.

                                                Within a few hours of receiving the vaccine my arm was in excruciating pain. Was not able to lift  more than 45 degrees. Than dizziness and vertigo started. That evening I had the chills, night sweats (possible fever). Headaches persisted for the rest of the week with dizziness. Arm pain started to subside by Monday but then came the extreme neck pain. I was not able to move my neck side to to side and  forward flexion caused pain. I sought the help of a physical therapist who was concerned about my symptoms and astonished by the pain and level of inflammation in the neck region. I received treatment the week following the vaccine and I am now on week 2 and the neck pain is still here but not as severe only pain turning to the left and the headaches are less frequent.

Headaches and dizziness persisted throughout the day. that evening i had chills, night sweats and possible fever. Arm pain did not subside until monday of the following week. But with the arm pain subsiding came the extreme pain in my neck. could not move it in any direction. I sought the attention of a physical therapist who was shocked with the inflammation and pain. I have received treatment for the last week for the consistent headaches and neck pain. It is now week 2 and the pain is lessening but not completely gone. the headaches are less frequent and arm pain is gone.

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

                                                I received the vaccine in my right arm, the placement of the vaccine was more towards the front of my arm, rather then the middle of my deltoid. My right arm was sore the next day (12-30-2020) , which is predicted, but the pain hasn&#39;t gone away. I cannot sleep on my right side, if I do, I cannot lift my arm, it takes a few hours for my arm to &#34;warm up&#34; before I can use it again with minimal pain. The pain is right in the middle of my deltoid, I can palpitate the exact location of the pain.

This lasted for two days. On day 3 I began to feel dizzy and have extreme low back pain and stomach pain with nausea with again lack of appetite. By this time the body aches and arm pain went away but I still have a headache. Now on day 4 the low back pain has gone away but still I have a headache and lack of appetite and nausea.

This writer instructed her to sit down.  This writer then requested assistance from RN.  As RN approached where patient was sitting, patient stated &#34;yeah I&#39;m going to faint&#34; she then fell forward from her chair onto the floor, with the top of her head hitting the floor first.  RN instructed staff to call the Rapid Response Team who was unavailable.  This writer gathered the anaphylaxis/reaction supplies that were on hand.  Patient&#39;s body postured and at that time RN rolled her onto her side.  Patient quickly regained consciousness.  Vitals were taken and stable. Patient was given the opportunity to be seen in the ED multiple times but she declined.   She stated that her lips felt &#34;tingly&#34; and was given 50mg/20mL Diphenhydramine oral solution.  She remained in the COVID vaccination clinic at Medical Center for observation for 40 minutes, at which time her husband retrieved her and escorted her home.

                                                Three days after my COVID vaccine in my left arm (1/11), I woke up suddenly (1/15) with shooting electric pains down my whole left arm, a totally numb left arm, and extreme pins and needles and uncontrollable body movements throughout my body which slowly subsided over the next hour. I went to the ER, no testing was completed. 24 hours later my arm gave out completely, and while it has regained function over the last couple of weeks the top portion of my arm is still weak and feels twitchy and uncomfortable at the site of the injection.

Around 1:00am on 1/23/21 I felt a stabbing pain at the site of injection as well as an aching numbness from my left shoulder down to my left pinky finger.  The morning of 1/23/21 I was weak and could barely walk, and I had a fever of 100.9. I got chills and would feel inexplicable cold and have goosebumps despite my fever. I had no appetite and was extremely fatigued. When sleeping on and off throughout the day I had extreme sweats and soaked my bedsheets. My muscles ached and touch was painful, even the spray of a shower felt painful.These symptoms continued until the early morning of Monday 1/25/21 which was the last time I experienced chills.

It felt like when you hit your elbow too hard and get both a deep, dull, aching pain, and a burning, shooting nerve pain. I experienced it down both arms and both legs, with the leg pain lasting longer and feeling more severe than the arm pain. I also experienced muscle spasms in my arms, legs, and lower back, with nerve pain shooting from my lower back into my legs, almost like sciatica. The pain was between a 7 or 8/10 at most times and was some of the worst pain I?ve continuously felt in my life. The pain subsided around 16 hours after starting, however I?m still experiencing occasional shooting pain or sudden aching in my bones or muscle spasms, although it?s usually only one area at a time and very brief/manageable. During the 16 hours, I also had joint stiffness that was severe enough to limit my ability to move and I had difficulty walking to the bathroom or shifting positions in bed. It also mostly subsided after the 16 hours, however I am still experiencing minor joint stiffness still.

I was sitting on the couch, and my partner noticed I have having a seizure, he lowered to me to the ground and called the ambulance. My seizure lasted for 1 minute.  When I was in the ER, they gave me 2 bags of fluids, they did an X-ray, CT scan, blood work, and UA, they reported to me that all the result were normal. They did not send me home with any medications. However, they did not clear me to drive. They said that I need to get cleared by a neurologist before I can drive, so that?s why I have not been back to work?

                                                Around 5:30 PM I began experiencing normal symptoms like headache and muscle ache. At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

Migraine symptoms were relieved in 2 hours but still experienced some side effects of the medication such as dizziness. I got my 2nd dose of Moderna at 18:10, 2/17/21. I started to experience tingling sensation in my head at 23:00. The tingling was unilateral in the left parietal and left occipital areas. On 2/18/21, I experienced dizziness, fatigue, general weakness, bad headaches, and nausea. I took Acetaminophen 600mg at 22:00, and symptoms were gone on 2/19/20. But my migraines were more frequent since vaccination, but i did not take any medication for that. Today (2/22/21), some post vaccination symptoms are back, including headache, dizziness, fatigue.

On 2/11/21, felt chills, fatigue, malaise, body aches. On 2/12/21, symptoms subsided except slightly sore arm. Arm became itchy and developed 3 large red lumps on my shoulder/upper arm (only one lump was at the injection site. Other lumps were distal). Benadryl used for itchiness. Lumps subsided by 2/13/21 in the evening with slight skin discoloration.  As of today, 2/25/21, experienced stabbing pain through my upper arm that lasts seconds and subsided. Occurs 2-3 times a day

                                                Around 10 minutes after the dose, I started feeling my throat close up, I could not concentrate and felt very dizzy. 20 minutes later I felt a sharp stabbing pain in right side of my throat and my chest/lung area. I started feeling itchy in that area as well. I started getting bumps all over. I took 2 puffs of my Symbicort, Benadryl, and Loratadine. I continued taking the Symbicort and Benadryl. I fell asleep siting up. By 12/24 I could not swallow and it would hurt my chest to breath so I decided to go to the ER.

We offered her a bottle water and then walked with her (with an arm on each side) to another room, where we had her sit down against a wall and put her head between her knees.  She also stated she felt very hot, so we got her a cool compress for the back of her neck.  We had her wait for another 15 mins (total of 30mins) before she started feeling better, her coloring looked better (she was very pale at first) and she felt better enough to drive home.

I had to take a Benadryl for the allergic reaction.  but the reason why my arm got swollen was because the person who gave me the injection put the vaccine really close to my shoulder so most probably he poke a vein or nerve and injected the medication directly in my vein because in just seconds of getting the vaccine that started happening.  and the next day i also got normal side effects pain to my arm, bodyaches, fever, nausea, headache but i took tylenol for the fever and muscle and body aches and severe cold and flu medication

                                                Arm is swollen sore hot to the touch has a rash.  Pain is radiating down to my hand and up my shoulder. Also no appetite since the vaccine combined with dizzy spells. I?ve been to the ER twice thought it was anxiety but it?s becoming to consistent for anxiety.  Feel like my blood pressure is going up and down.  ER assumed it was anxiety because that?s what I thought it was at first. Normal doctor did virtual visit today and said it all seems to possibly be a reaction to the shot.

                                                Within 2 hours of the shot, I got a headache and started feeling deathly ill.  I felt as if I was going to vomit and nothing I did helped.  My arm got a little red and sore a few hours after the injection.  Over the next few days my arm continued to get even more red &amp; irritated as well as swelling some.  I have photographs of each phase of the irritation; if this is needed, I will gladly send them in to you all.  I had to stay out of work that whole weekend (2/26, 2/27, &amp; 2/28) due to not being able to get out of bed.  I stayed in bed for the majority of the weekend sleeping and was not up moving around more than 8 hours the whole weekend.  Since I was still sick and having issues after so many days, the Medical Control Unit at my job (run by our Fire &amp; Rescue Department) made me get tested on 3/1/21 to make sure it was not COVID.   Later that afternoon, the test came back as negative.  I still was feeling nauseated and fatigued even weeks after the shot.  I have stayed nauseated since then and have also been very tired still.

The patient felt like something was poking her face almost like her face was paralyzed and felt nauseous. The event facial paralysis was considered medically significant and serious.  The patient tried acetaminophen which did not work and then took ibuprofen which was effective.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events confusion, disorientation, could not drive herself/impaired driving ability, nausea, fever/pyrexia, body aches/general body pain, sensitive teeth/hyperaesthesia teeth, poking in face/facial paralysis were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Nausea and fever are consistent with the vaccine safety profile.

                                                I was having intense chest pain, weakness/faintness feeling a few days after second dose of Moderna vaccine. I went into the ER after 4th day of pain.   ER did a CT scan and found a couple blood clots in my right lung (pulmonary embolisms) along with tissue  on lung. An ultrasound of my heart and legs were done to find the source of these blood clots and neither tests found blood clots or indicators that this is where they originated.   I am currently in blood thinners in order to reduce the clots.

My BP went as high as 180/110 and did not go down until 5 hours later. I was recommended to go to the ER by ambulance and instead had a friend take me. After blood screening, the doctor stated it was adverse effect from vaccine. They treated with saline, benedryl and Ativan and was sent home. I will continue to monitor and notate any other symptoms

                                                Severe Dizziness,  nausea/vomiting, severe weakness. On April 31 I started showing early signs of Shingles, though I did not know it (because I suffer from fibromyalgia, the pain felt similar). Still not knowing I had shingles, I received my second vaccine if Moderna May 3rd at 8:30am. Later on that day my  Shingles rash appeared. I assumed it was a reaction and waited 2 days before realizing it was shingles.

                                                The onset of symptoms started around 9:15am. I experienced numbness and tingling to bilateral feet and lower legs. I experienced dizziness. I also experienced an increased heart rate (160s-170s BPM). I was hyperventilating and had difficulty with breathing. I was pale and cold.  I had uncontrollable shakes. My BP was a bit higher than my normal but not hypertensive.  I was given candy and juice after onset of symptoms. ( I did have an English muffin prior to receiving the vaccine). My symptoms subsided for some time but then came back about 15 minutes later. These symptoms continued to occur about every 15 minutes for a period of close to 2 hours. I was given Benadryl 50mg PO after the first hour of symptoms. I continued to experience the symptoms for up to about 45 minutes after being given Benadryl. My symptoms began to subside and eventually stopped after the 2 hour mark.

                                                I received my vaccination at my place of work. Local pharmacy came in to administer them.  In less then a minute of recieving the vaccination I experienced a tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  I told my symptoms to the  pharmacist that was there.  I had to take my mask off due to the difficulty breathing.  I sat down and was trying to catch my breath.  Roughly 10 -15 minutes passes then my throat began to swell.  My extremities were feeling tingly and I was very dizzy.  I sat with my neck extended to maintain my airway until they could locate some benedryl.  My voice was wheezy when attempting to answer questions the pharmacist was asking.  The pharmacist wanted to administer the EpiPen but I would not allow her to because then they would have to call 911.  It took about 45 minutes in total to locate benedryl.  I took 50 mg.  Roughly 15 -20 minutes after taking the benedryl I was able to breath with ease.  I waited about another 15 minutes at the facility to ensure I was ok.  I was told I would not be recieving the second dose due to my anaphylactic reaction.

Then about 5 minutes after leaving, I felt weak as if I was about to faint. Once I got to Peds, I felt even more weak. I could barely sit up. Nurse advised me to go back. Once I got there I was still feeling weak. I was sent home. The rest of the evening I was still feeling weak and as if I was about to get a headache, The next day (1/8), I felt muscle aches and tiredness. It hurt to even walk. As well my arm where I received the vaccine was sore and hurt to move.

I took Benadryl for my skin and was fine after about a hour. Exactly a week later the injection site was red/hot and itchy. The next day which is 1/19/21 same thing the injection site was hot red and itchy. I also felt chest tightness, headache, nausea and dizziness. I spoke with my doctor over the phone and she prescribed me Albuterol which helped with the chest tightness. I also took Benadryl for my arm which helped. The very next night 1/20/21 the same thing happened to my arm again. It got red and itchy and I felt nauseous.

Next day it was on/off pain, with very intense pain when it came on to the point that I was unable to lift or do things. On Sunday (next day), pain seemed to radiate from the shoulder up through my left neck to the cranium area. Monday (today) this evening - pain so intense that I was screaming and sobbing. Husband (also MD) had to medicate me as I was laying on bed screaming unable to move or roll over. He had to manually lift me. Significant pain in left neck (trapezius) area on inhales, near injection site. Pain has been getting worse each night.

Approximately 4-5 minutes later experienced sudden flushed very warm face and red skin), dizziness, chills/tremors, and drop in blood pressure (feeling faint). Went back to observation site to ensure monitoring. No breathing issues occurred. Remained there for 25 minutes until heart rate stabilized.  Went home and took Benadryl. Skin reaction persisted for approx 2 hours post vaccination. I have a history of severe allergies (gastrointestinal and skin symptoms) and eczema.

                                                Tachycardia (active) Had expected chills, headache, fever (101.5-101.9, oral)... around 6am on 1/28/21, I took a warm shower and had near vasovagal syncope episode after feeling lightheaded and dizzy. As a result, I had mild nausea. If went away after 20 minutes. As the expected chills, headache, and fever continued, I started to develop tachycardia at rest (107-172bpm) with heart palpitations around 9:30am. The palpitations went away approximately 2 hours later. I still continue to have tachycardia with minor shortness of breath sensation.  My heart rate is currently 115bpm at rest. My typical resting heart rate is 65-70bpm.

                                                7:00 pm that night, my arm started to hurt very intensely and then the next day when I woke up and it hurt - felt like it broke my arm. It hurt really bad - couldn&#39;t left it or move it. I took Tylenol once or twice that day with six hours in between. I was a little bit drowsy and headache and a little bit nauseous.  So I slept that day. I felt like my arm got hit by truck. 10th - I felt better that day. By Monday, the 11th, I was totally fine. Pregnancy: I&#39;m due May 29, 2021; I have had a miscarriage before so it&#39;s my second pregnancy. So far everything has been normal.

Later that evening I got a stomach ache, the chills/hot flashes, arm soreness and the shakes. Most lasted until the following morning when I got up at 6:15am for work. The following morning I was only experiencing shakiness and arm soreness. About a week in a half later, I developed a rash at the injection site that looked like two large red blobs. The rash was slightly itchy and lasted only a couple of days.

At approximately 12:30 at night, I woke up due to the pain I was feeling all over my body (in particular in my joints and lower back). I also have a severe headache. At approximately 2:30am I experienced nausea and some vomiting followed by chills without fever. The headache, body aches, and extreme exhaustion continued until approximately 9pm the day after the shot. Two days later, almost all symptoms were gone (I still felt tired). I had a small red spot at the injection site that lasted 2 days but the injection site pain was way worse for the first shot than the second one.

As the day went on started to feel sick with shivers,  fever, nausea and body aches. Very shaky and feverish in the middle of the night and woke up to the bed drenched with sweat. Was close to vomiting.  Recorded my temperature the next day. Highest recorded temp was 100.7. Slight loss of appetite over the course of 2-3 to 2-4.  Arm started itching 2-4 and is still itchy today 2-6, but nothing extreme. Arm still is hard, raised up, tender and warm around injection site. Felt pretty much back to normal upon waking on 2-5.

Broke out in a cold sweat. Started to loose consciousness. Arms (middle-upper) to my hands began to tingle and went numb. I lost muscle control in both of my hands and my fingers were very stiff, I could not move them. My feet and lower legs were also tingly. I felt nauseous and in need of the toilet. I was able to crawl to the bathroom at which point I had diarrhea. I regained feeling and motor control of my hands shortly after but continued to experience extreme light headed ness for the next hour.

Today is 02/08/2021 and my lymph nodes on my neck and armpit on my left side are still swollen and painful to the touch and I?m having problems moving my neck.

                                                Saturday evening, started having sharp pins and needles sensation in joints (knees, hips, elbows and shoulders). I couldn?t fall asleep that morning I woke up vomiting. Had a fever of 101.1F. Had a fever all Sunday, got as high as 103.3F.  Had large red rash on the arm of the injection site that is hot to the touch, hard, itchy, and feels like a sunburn when you touch it (burns).  Had really stiff and sore neck and shoulders, hard to move head from side to side. Headache all day Sunday. Couldn?t sleep Sunday night because of pins and needles in joints again. Got up at around 6am vomiting. Fever of 100.1F. Temp lowered to 99.1 by 7:30pm. Tuesday, no headache or vomiting. Slept through the night without any pins and needles pain. No fever, but really stiff and sore neck and shoulders still. Red spot of arm has grown.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Within 8 hours of receiving the 2nd Moderna dose in right upper arm, I was experiencing 9/10 sharp upper arm pain (00:30 2/10/2021). The pain was so intense I almost vomited and was not able to sleep. My range of motion was severely limited, and I had to use my left arm to help move my right arm.  This continued through 2/10/2021. At 1300 took 1000 mg Tylenol and had minor relief for an hour. Tried to stay hydrated and move my right arm as I could, which was still very limited. Woke up at 01:30 early morning 2/11/2021 with intense pain in right upper arm still, not able to sleep. Range of motion continues to be severely limited due to pain. Made an appointment with PCP office first thing. I was concerned I could have SIRVA and wanted to get a medical professional?s opinion. She said it is probably a combination of the Moderna vaccine and a ?bad injection,? meaning the nurse administering my vaccine at facility was very high on my deltoid (almost to my joint). I was told to call back if my arm pain or range of motion worsens.

I finally took Tylenol at 2pm and it worked wonders. I was still sick but was able to relax and sleep. Felt like mild flu after Tylenol. Next day (2 days after vaccine) felt much much better. Still have slight weakness like after being sick and some light headedness but feel like I should be back to 100% tmw.

                                                I received my vaccine on 2/10/21. I had expected side effects of fevers, chills, body aches, headache on 2/11 - 2/13. I continued with a persistent headache throughout the week. A presure in my head, worse with standing up, and it made me dizzy when I stood up. On the night of 2/18/21 I developed left sided ear pain. On 2/19/21 I developed a left sided otitis media. On 2/21/21 I developed sudden onset left sided facial droop. I had a negative head CT, and was diagnosed with bells palsy related to the swelling in my ear from the otitis media.   I continue to have significant ear pain, and left sided facial paralysis today.

                                                I had hives despite having taken my daily dose of Claritin that seemed to get worse as the day continued. I reached out to my Healthcare clinic and they were unsure if there was a simple treatment and almost required me to go the emergency room for this. I conducted a telehealth consultation with a doc who was not my primary care physician and was unfamiliar with my preexisting exercise urticaria condition that occasionally results in light hives but never anaphylaxis for me without Claritin. I declined going to the emergency room since this did not seem that serious and instead took another Claritin to try to get the somewhat worsening hives with no apparent cause to stop without an unnecessarily escalated situation. My throat was slightly itchy but I never became anaphylactic likely due to taking an additional Claritin and not doing anything requiring physical effort for the day beyond telecons from home because I left the office to telework mid morning after I started getting continually slightly worse hives. By evening I was ok and the next day just had a slightly sore throat but was able to work and just started the day with 2 Claritin without any further instance of hives appearing. The day after that I returned to my standard 1 Claritin dose with no ill effects. From this event, it seems clear that a 72 hour downing period from dose 1 is insufficient and should be upped to 96 hours. Prior to this more severe event, I had, on days 2 and 3, a sore left arm at injection site that prevented me from even reasonably lifting my arm to a height sufficient to grab my cell phone off it&#39;s charger while lying in bed without serious discomfort. That level of arm discomfort prevented me from working out or would have prevented me from anything other than light office work involving my vaccine arm. My level of tiredness for the couple days following this dose also required that I take an hour long nap days 1 and 2, and no nap at all is usually the norm for me.

Sound became amplified and began to experience a migraine.  &#34;People talking low to me felt like they were screaming into my ear drums.&#34; Extreme fatigue so could barely keep eyes open.  Standing was difficult; moved to wheelchair. Most symptoms lasted 2 to 3 days.  Fever of 102 on first day only.  Fatigue for one week.  Right upper arm, not at the injection site, had a &#34;hive&#34; about the size of a nickel that has not gone away (as of 2/23/21).   New migraines with light sensitivity that affect ability to work also have not gone away (as of 2/23/21).

Tuesday morning, I woke up with paresthesias in both feet and lower legs, also minor numbness in both hands.  Wednesday afternoon, symptoms were still present, so I went to urgent care.  Still having paresthesias in feet and left hand. Also having some fatigue, nausea, and mild intermittent dizziness.

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine I woke up and could not breathe out of my nose I was completely clogged up. My body hurts so badly that I could not take my dog outside to use the bathroom. I was hobbling around like I was 80 years old and I?m only 30. I was very emotional and had bursts of crying episodes. I have never experienced body pain like this. I had chills like I had a fever. I slept the whole day into the night.

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

                                                Last night my arm started having some separate raised bumps near the injection site. It was warm to the touch but I thought a shower would help it go away. I went to sleep around 10:45 pm  it had seemed a little better (not itchy) but when I woke up all the raised dots had become one blob (about 2 inches by 1 and a half inches) and it?s more swollen than it was last night. It is hot to the touch and I feel a little light headed and woozy and my arm is a little sore. I?m not very worried about it- I read online that this reaction has happened to some people about 8 days after their shot  and I just wanted to make sure that I reported so that the cdc and the fda or whoever needs it can collect the data.

Pt states felt almost like an &#34;out of body&#34; experience, but she did feel pressure to the left side of her head as she fell off of her chair and her head hit the floor. This fall was witnessed by another patient, who flagged the medical staff for help. A medical assistant notified me of the incident and I went to examine the patient, who was sitting on the floor, alert and conscious. I asked the staff to get the patient an ice pack, which was placed to patient&#39;s forehead and back of neck, and glass of water. Patient is able to swallow.   A&amp;O x 3, HR 81 and O2 sat 98% on room air. EOMI, PERRLA. Auscultation of heart &amp; lungs was normal. No bony step-offs palpated. No tenderness upon palpation to patient&#39;s head, face and neck/c-spine. No visible contusions, abrasions noted. Normal ROM of all extremities and normal sensation. Observed patient over the course of 15 minutes and patient states she is feeling much better.

Stiffness in the joint started progressing to the point of patient having trouble taking off her socks and walking. Patient was walking with a painful limp. At 12:30 AM on 2-1-21 patient awoke with pain radiating down left leg and could not bend leg or move in bed. The pain lessened a Medrol pack relieved pain for two days. On 2-4-21, patient awoke with such pain that she went to the emergency room. Sciatica was the diagnosis which patient has never had. Patient awoke with severe pain again on 2-7-21 and had another trip to the emergency room. Sciatica was determined the problem again and a CT was ordered that showed no back or disc issues. Pain and difficulty walking has continued to persist even with medication and physical therapy. Patient is using a walker with continued decreased strength and pain in the left leg and hip.

                                                I received my first shot on 1/29. I had some severe arm pain and fatigue for the first two days but nothing out of the ordinary. In the early morning on 2/4, 7 days after my shot, I started getting chills, had a splitting headache and my left underarm was too sensitive to move. I went to bed, woke up the next morning, the chills were gone but the headache snd swollen lymph nodes remained. My headache subsided after a day, my swollen left arm lymph nodes  stuck around for 2-3 days. By 2/6, I developed the red ring on my arm that I had read to be Covid arm which seemed rare but happening per the news.  By 2/7-2/8 I was able to comfortably move my arm again and my rash subsided.   I received my second shot on 2/26 and happy to report I had minor arm pain again and fatigue but no other adverse reactions at this time. It?s now been 13 days.

Then I started to feel very dizzy and light headed. My body could not hold me up so I fell to the floor. My heart started to palpitate very fast, and I could not catch my breath to try to regulated my self. I was like this for maybe 20 minutes. While this was happening the clinic called 911 for a ambulance. While this was happening I could not talk, my words and my thoughts could not connect for lack of a better world. I was like THIS FOR 4 hours not being able to talk. After this my word get getting confused with other word and switching them around with other words.

                                                The following morning after I received my 2nd Moderna vaccine, I was awoken by my symptoms around 3:30am. My arm became so swollen and painful, I could not extend my arm at all.  I could only keep it bent and close to my body. I could not use my left arm at all for 2-3 days after the vaccine. The swelling got so bad that my entire arm felt numb and tingley and throbbed uncontrollably whenever I tried to move it.  I took ibuprofen and tylenol, every 6-7 hours as well as used warm and cold compresses, and that did nothing to help the swelling. The pain medications only took a slight edge off of the pain. I experienced these symptoms along with fever, body aches, muscle pain, joint pain, muscle spasms in my arm and leg muscles,  headache, and my nose was very runny after waking up in the morning.  All of those symptoms lasted for several days as well.  The numbness and pain lasted for a full week after the vaccine. It is now March 26th and my arm is still a bit sore at the vaccine site.  On Wednesday, March 24th, the vaccine site starting throbbing again and I did experience a low grade fever of 99.7 throughout the day. I felt very fatigued throughout the week as well.

I kept saying i needed to go home, so he called an uber to my apartment. Nose was running, blurry vision, unable to walk alone when uber came to pick me and partner up. Kept seeing black and white stars when trying to cross the road to uber. Once I got home, I had watery stool in my underwear and had to stay on toilet for 30 minutes for watery stool to pass. Then kept alternating between feeling cold and hot while under blankets. Slept for 5 hours. Then felt fine. On Sunday, slept for about 15 hours - 18 hours. Throat kept hurting. Today, Monday, feel better but throat feels like there is a lump in it.

                                                36 hours after vaccination I woke up at 3:15am with severe abdominal cramping, dizziness, excessive thirst, and nausea. The area around the injection site was swollen, red, and painful to touch. I fell over on my way to the toilet due to extreme dizziness. I had three hours of diarrhea, and then took pepto bismal and bennydryl. Those remedies worked and my symptoms subsided and I was able to fall back asleep by 4am. In the morning I felt normal, besides some remaining pain and redness surrounding the injection site.

                                                Around 11pm, a pain began in my left arm around the injection site that extended down to my elbow. The pain steadily increased throughout the night until I was no longer able to move my arm above the elbow joint. The pain stopped increasing by morning but has been holding steady for all of today (the day after the injection) and I am still mostly unable to move my arm. A fever of 100.0 - 100.5 developed around 10:00am on 1/5/21 and still remains.

My left arm was very painful, even when not touching it or moving it. When I woke up in the morning, fever was higher (100.7) and I was so weak I could barely walk to the bathroom. I felt very dizzy and tired. I drank water and took ibuprofen for the pain. Stayed on the couch all day and took ibuprofen PM to sleep last night. Woke up very early today with a fever of 99.4 and still a bad headache and weak. Walking to the bathroom makes me feel like I need a nap.

                                                Presumed right arm muscle injury.  Several hours after the injection my arm was extremely sore and painful. The joint was painful as well. No redness or swelling. It was tender to touch. I was having difficulty reaching my arm up or moving it upward. Ex: it hurt to lift my hand to touch my face.  I also couldn?t let it fall. If I got my arm above my head I would have to assist it down. I couldn?t sleep that night because of the pain. I was having trouble with pushing movements in that arm. And also letting it hang dependently (like letting my arm hang when I hinged forward). I started taking Motrin 24 hours after the injection. Motrin helped, so I took it Friday and Saturday. Sunday, my arm felt 99% back to normal.  Monday and Tuesday I didn?t notice anything.   Wednesday  morning I woke up with the same pain again and difficulty moving my arm. Wednesday night, I couldn?t sleep again because of the pain/couldn?t get my arm in a comfortable position. I?m taking Motrin, with not as much relief as before. I?ve applied heat and I?ve tried to stretch it as well.   The only way i really know how to describe it? is that it feels as if my deltoid was injured. And my other muscles are fine. It?s hindering my movement in that arm. It is again, tender to touch my deltoid area. The tightness has extended in to my shoulder and neck. It has now been 8 days since my vaccination.

This got better. On day 7 after getting the vaccine I developed a firm, raised, HOT and extremely itchy area at the site of injection. This is measuring at 5cm by 5 cm on my Left deltoid.  This continues to get larger and larger.  I have also had daily headaches since the vaccine was given. I seen a doctor who recommended calling the CDC who then advised me to complete a VAERS report.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

                                                10:47a went into a room to wait for 15 minutes directly after the injection. Began to feel somewhat dizzy right afterwards. Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

                                                12 hours after injection (1/8/2021) I began running a low grade fever (99.8), experiencing a debilitating headache, had injection site tenderness as well as swelling the size of a baseball. I iced the injection site and put compression on, in case it was a hematoma from the injection. From 1/8/2021 -1/10/2021 I continued to run a low grade fever, never reaching above 100 degrees. I had full body aches and was exhausted as if a bus ran me over. The injection site swelling slowly reduced with continued ice and compression. From 1/10/2021 - 1/13/2021 I did not have a fever, however I continued to experience intermittent headaches that were as painful as several days prior. I felt chronically exhausted as well. On 1/14/2021 I began to run a low grade fever again (99.8). At this point the injection side swelling was a 6.5cm x 5cm ring of what I believe to be induration. Headache and exhaustion persisted. Friday 1/15/2021 I did not have a fever, but I began to notice that simple tasks such as walking to the kitchen were increasingly difficult. When checked, my oxygen saturation was 98 percent, but my heart rate was 115 while sitting. Saturday 1/16/2021 I began running a fever again, this time reaching 100 degrees. I developed a full body rash, red spots never raised. Again, I continued to have extreme exhaustion and headaches and tachycardia. I took some benadryl to help with the rash. Sunday 1/17/2021 the rash and fever returned, headaches and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia continued. Monday 1/18/2021 I began having a sore throat, fever and rash developed again. Headache and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia as well. Tuesday 1/19/2021 my fever elevated to 100.5, headache, exhaustion, sore throat, tachycardia. However, by Tuesday there was no longer red visible spots. My entire body still itched and felt as if there was a burning sensation, however I could not find any visible red spots to correlate with the itching and burning. Today Wednesday 01/20/2021 I have never felt worse. My entire body feels like it has been repeatedly ran over by a semi truck. My throat hurts. My head hurts. My body burns as if it&#39;s on fire. I am so incredibly tired I feel like it&#39;s an extreme sport just to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom. My fever today 01/20/2021 reached a new 101.4, I&#39;m still tachycardic. Oxygen saturation is within normal limits. However, the induration around the injection site seems to have almost completely resolve.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 10:45a, I then went next door to be monitored for 15 minutes. Within a few minutes, I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I waited out the 15 minutes and went back to my office. When I got into my office I still felt lightheaded and I informed my supervisor. I explained to him that I was going to try and eat something and drink some water and I would feel better. I went into my office and continued to work for the next hour. After that hour, I began to feel very dizzy and &#34;out of it&#34; as I almost didn&#39;t know where I was at. I went to speak to my supervisor and I sat down in his office where I almost fainted. He took me back to my office where I sat with another co-worker. Duri time, I continued to feel light headed, although it came in waves. My husband drove me home, I showered, ate something and was feeling better. Around 6:00p, I began to feel lightheaded again and began to experience body aches, hot and cold flashes that would come in waves. Saturday morning, I woke up feeling better, but around 10:00a I began to experience the same symptoms. I laid down for a few hours that would get up and attempt tasks around the house, then I would  ended up back in bed at 6:00p with the same symptoms again. I did meet virtually with a doctor and she explained to me to wait it out. On Monday, I met with my pcp and she informed me of the same, that these symptoms would eventually go away. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the only symptom that remained was the dizziness. At times, I still will feel dizzy for instance Saturday morning I woke up and felt pretty dizzy throughout the day.

                                                Experienced severe redness about 2.5-3? in diameter around vaccination administration site Area was very swollen, warm to the touch, tough, and incredibly painful which caused me to have difficulty moving my arm/using my arm in general and limited my normal daily activities for 4 total days. Pain, swelling, redness, and toughness began to dissipate around Day 5 and was markedly improved by Day 8 when I completely returned to normal activities.  Additionally, the first day after the vaccination, I experienced muscle aches/pains and severe generalized fatigue that almost made me call out from work. This fatigue and muscle pain was very strong for ~72 hours after the vaccination. However, I was still able to go to work, though my productivity was not the same given the amount of fatigue I experienced and the inability to utilize my right arm to the same degree I would during a normal work day.

Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

Her blood pressure was taken multiple times ranging from 145/80 to 155/95.  After approximately 40 minutes after the vaccine, the patient stood up and fainted. We kept the patient on the floor as she was light headeed and not very responsive. At that time, 911 was called.  She was taken tp the ER and discardged the same evening.

Shoulder pain continued through to the day after vaccination (day 1) - had to take tylenol around the clock. By day 2 it was normal. On Day 0, around 8-10 hours post vaccination, I had rigors which lasted a few mins, chills, fevers, myalgias. Took tylenol. On day 1, about 17 hours from vaccination, I woke up with lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea. Felt like I was going to pass out. Laid down, and it passed. Continued with myalgias, fevers, chills, fatigue on day 1. By day 2, I felt normal. I took tylenol day 0 and day 1.

Chills, shaking, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.  At about 24 hours I developed a terrible migraine.  My fevers persisted despite taking ibuprofen.  At about 48 hours I was finally able to keep fevers down and am now feeling better.  The dizziness was so bad my husband had to walk me to the bathroom to throw up.  The fever and chills were so bad I couldn&#39;t rest for longer than 5-15 minute increments.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/29 at 5 pm and was feeling fine afterwards with only a slightly sore arm at the injection site.   Then yesterday, 1/30 around 6 pm, I started to have a very fast heart rate, despite not exerting myself and only sitting down at the time. Between 6-6:45 pm, I had a heart rate between 125-140 bpm, according to my fit bit device that tracks my heart rate on my wrist. Anyways, after that I was going to the bathroom and started to feel nauseous, light headed, felt hot and chills like a fever, abdominal pain and vision issues (blackening in some spots and blurry on and off) so I went to lay down. I didn&#39;t vomit and the chills/hot fever feeling went away in 15 minutes. I also took my temperature and it was normal. My abdominal pain continued but the light headedness and nausea and vision issues subsided. I was unable to get up and do other stuff, so I just slept it off. I&#39;m feeling better this morning. I  had also drank about a half glass of wine (maybe 2 oz), so i&#39;m not sure if that contributed to it, but i&#39;ve never felt that way after drinking wine, especially that small of an amount. I had also drank this wine around 4 pm and that was 2.5 hours before I started feeling this way and did not drink anything on the day I received the injection.

I was unable to control my fever/pain with IBU or APAP. These symptoms lasted approximately 36 hours. At about that time, I began experiencing GI upset, where I was throwing up and had no appetite for 48 additional hours.

This subsided over the week until 8 days after when it started to become red and itchy. Two days after this started, I took a shower and my entire upper left arm was red with a very defined rash (a circle around the injection site with a fully red oval extending underneath) and still very itchy which has continued through this week. The redness is still there and itches randomly. No treatment has been done and I have images to demonstrate this.

                                                Almost 12 hours after receiving the injection I woke up from sleep with chills and a fever. This didn&#39;t last long - maybe a couple hours. I fell asleep without an issue and woke up in the morning with SEVERE arm pain as well as fatigue and like generalized weakness - I essentially felt like I was getting sick with a cold or something. This lasted a couple days but the arm pain was terrible. It felt like someone had taken a baseball bat to my upper arm - I had very limited range of motion and felt severe pain in the region of my joint capsule. This eventually went away, but I still feel like my arm is a little stiffer than it was previously - it cracks and pops when I do yoga and such and it never did this before.

Took ibuprofen during the day &amp; nyquil at night.  Feb 5, Wed- 3am, getting ready for work, arm very hot and sore. Discovered a swollen red patch on injection site. Unable to lift arm all the way due to pain. Redness spreads through out the day. Took Benadryl 25mg at 5:20pm, and another at 7:20pm, redness and swelling still not subsiding.  Next day, arm is not as swollen or red but still painful to touch and hot and more itchy. Seems to be spreading slowly lower down and subsiding from the top.

The injector told me that she felt my muscle spasm as she put the needle in. Within one hour, my arm got very sore to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it. I am now 6 days later and still have extreme pain in my left arm and have a hard time sleeping due to the discomfort.

                                                Vaccine given too high in the arm.  Being an immunizer myself for a different company  I expressed concern immediately before vaccination, but was told that that was ?where it goes? and she injected me anyway.   Experienced burning 2 minutes following vaccination.  The following day I started experiencing shooting nerve pain in my affected arm and tingling in my fingertips.  My range of motion was considerably decreased in the affected arm as well.  Symptoms worsened after returning to work and trying to use the arm all day.  I contacted facility via email on Tuesday, February 2nd, via phone Saturday, February 6th, and again via email yesterday, February 8th.   I have not received any response.  I found a provider who was able to see me and was covered by my insurance and was seen this morning at 9:20 am by the physician?s PA.  Following physical exam and observation of the small bruise indicating the injection site,  she stated she believed my immunizer hit a nerve with the needle and prescribed a rapid prednisone taper.

                                                I woke up around 2:30am with chills, fever, body aches and  had a hard time moving my left arm. I took 100mg of acetaminophen and felt some relief, but after 3hrs the symptoms came back. I continued to take 1000mg of acetaminophen and  800mg ibuprofen alternately every 4hrs with a little relief but the chills and body aches continued for 24hrs with intermittent nausea and diarrhea.  The second day I woke up with a migraine that lasted around 24hrs with no relief from symptoms even when taking  OTC migraine relief medications. On the third day post vaccine I woke up feeling  completely fine and have not had any lingering symptoms.

                                                received the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine on Wednesday, February 3rd. The injection was given much higher than the muscle area as the first dose, closer to the shoulder bone. I started that evening with a very intense sore upper arm and tingling in the bottoms of my feet. On yesterday 02/04, I started noticing it in my legs as well and unable to raise my arm above my head without extreme pain. This morning I woke up with the same symptoms and noticed I am dragging my feet slightly as I do not have much feeling in them accompanied by the tingling. I have made an appointment with my PCP for today, 02/05 at 11:30am. I do not have any of the following symptoms: fever, body aches, cough, sore throat, runny nose, loss of taste or smell, SOB, fatigue, chills, or headache.  I can be contacted if needed.   Dx with MS

She is pregnant (unsure of weeks, but was visibly pregnant). She was asked if she had discussed the vaccine with her provider, which she said she had at length talked with several of the OB doctors that she sees and all recommended she receive. Patient understood risks/benefits and lack of data in pregnancy at this point, and comfortable receiving. No issues immediately following the vaccine and was brought to adjacent room for observation. Within 5-10 minutes, she reported feeling warm, flushed, light-headed. She took coat off, drank cool water, and the feeling revolved within next 5-10 minutes. She was able to leave pharmacy on her own as reported felt back to normal.

                                                Broke out into hives immediately - within minutes. No issues with airway ever. I am still breaking out into hives daily. I also experienced cognitive function issues - memory gaps, brain fog, and could not walk a straight line. Those went away after the first week or so. I also had headache, body aches, fever, chills, dehydration, joint pain, and severe fatigue. This affected my daily life for about a week and half.

                                                Started getting a headache, took tylenol, then a rash has spread over my entire upper left arm, red, itchy, painful, raised. Woke up that evening with a 100.4 degree fever, and freezing with chills.   Next day was unable to function due to fatigue, fever, chills, and rash.  I could barely move my arm, and any slight touch caused pain to shoot through my arm.   All symptoms lasted until Sunday, February 28th until mid morning.   As of 3/1/2021, I no longer have a fever, or headache, still feeling fatigued, and my stomach is upset, as well as the rash on my arm has not gone away, the rash is warm to the touch, and still raised, but less red and painful as it was yesterday

                                                1st vaccine- sore arm with some swelling. Mild fatigue and nausea that day. Felt ok after that.  2nd vaccine- extremely sick 5 hours after vaccine. For 2 days had migraine, low grade fever,  severe body aches, extreme fatigue.  Couldn&#39;t stand longer than  3-5 mins.  Right arm was red, swollen and very sore for 3 days. The following week I had fatigue and flu like symptoms.  8 days after vaccine (Feb 21)  the following Sunday i was feeling worse like I had the flu and broke out with a localized rash on the right side of my neck.  The rash worsened and got more painful as the week went on and became pustules filled with clear fluid.  Sunday (Feb 28) I broke out with a rash all over my body. They were clear fluid filled pustules.  Monday ( March 1) I went to my primary care physician who stated i for sure had shingles but did not know what the secondary rash was from since it was all over my body and not just 1 side as with shingles.  The next day (Tues March 2) I went ad saw a dermatologist who  confirmed shingles and a secondary rare virus called disseminated zoster.  He was shocked saying he had only seen ever 2 other patients with this and they were immuno-compromised  and were on immunosupressants. It was been nearly a week since this diagnosis and I am still having nerve pain all over my body and extreme fatigue. The pustules are drying up.

                                                Itching all over the body started about 2 hours after receiving the vaccine ( around 11:30am). At noon, I noticed I was dizzy and weak, and I couldn&#39;t stand up without holding onto something. The itching got worse as the day went on and became intense and painful around 3pm. At that time, I noticed a rash on both arms, my legs and my chest, so I took 25mg of hydroxyzine (prescribed by my doctor) which has been helpful in the past for itching and rashes. Around 7pm, I had hives on my arms and legs, and the itching was getting worse and more painful. I also had intense itching on my face, especially on/around my nose. I took another 25mg of hydroxyzine but the itching wasn&#39;t subsiding and at that point, it was so bad that I couldn&#39;t focus on anything else. At 9pm, I still had hives and itching but also noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and it felt as though my throat was closing up. This continued throughout the night, with it being at its worst between 1-3am on March 12th. I woke up and the rash was gone, but the itchiness is still present and I&#39;m having trouble breathing. I keep choking and gasping for air.

                                                12 Days after the second dose i started breaking out in hives body wide. They have gotten progressively worse to the point that at times i cannot walk/bend at full capacity or have to leave work early. I?m taking Prednisone, Claritin (4x 24hr tablet) and Benadryl to partially control symptoms. I will be applying fo the Xolair shot at the 6 week mark since the OTC medications are not working effectively.

                                                The vaccine gave me the typical reactions such as fever, chills, tiredness, and a headache. Although, the pain spread from my arm to my legs. I started to feel weak as time went by and eventually by 10:00pm it became severe. I had developed a lump on shoulder and a rash formed. My left side of my body was numb and on Sunday March 14, 2021 I was dizzy and could barely move. It is not Monday March 15, 2021 and the lump grew larger and is now on my neck. My left arm hurts but some of my strength returned.

I couldn?t eat because eating made me feel nauseated. All I could do was drink water. This continued into the next day (Sunday). I slept almost the entire day. I had to call out of work on Monday due to severe exhaustion.

                                                Developed hives on opposite arm shortly after shot (but idiopathic hives are normal for me and it was the wrong arm so I thought nothing of it). Full body aches, especially in legs, from about 6:30pm on 3/13 to midnight of 3/14. Location of shot was warm to the touch, sore, and slightly swollen. Temp was 98.6 F.  After midnight the aches became centered on my legs and became more severe coming in waves every few seconds. Tachycardia. Muscle weakness. Nausea. Teeth began to hurt (from clenching?). Severe dizziness and vertigo starting from 7pm on 3/13 and peaking around midnight. Migraine with visual disturbances beginning at 7pm on 3/13 peaking at about 9pm and lasting at least several hours. Vertigo and migraine seemed related. Former worsened every time the pressure in my head did. Looked like the room lit up briefly every few seconds. My sense of touch felt off - textures felt different than normal and couldn?t feel my back when I touched it. Leg pain began to lessen around 4am, and fully resolved around 7am. Dizziness began to improve around 6am but persisted, albeit to a milder degree, for most of 3/14. Brain fog and sinus pressure from around 7pm 3/13 persisting through the following day. Some nausea throughout 3/14 but less severe than on 3/13. Poor temperature regulation from about 6pm 3/13 to 3pm 3/14. Symptoms became tolerable around 3:30pm on 3/14 and had mostly resolved by evening. Muscle weakness resolved by evening of 3/15. Pressure headache resolved by late morning 3/16.

                                                I was expecting to get the common side effects after my second dose, getting sick for a day about 12 hours after the 2nd dose. I did not get sick the next day, I just had the regular big red sore bump at the injection site. However, slightly more than a week after my 2nd dose, I started to experience double vision. Not blurry vision, but double vision, with one image on top of the other, both clear. At first it didn&#39;t bother me much, it was mostly happening in the mornings and in the evenings. Then suddenly, between the dates of 2/25 and 3/1, I started experiencing the double vision much more intensely and earlier in the day. It was not safe for me to drive, and it bothered me a lot, causing headaches and extreme nausea, I found myself going to bed at 6pm because I didn&#39;t want to be awake and deal with the side effects. I saw an Ophthalmologist (Dr.)  about the problem (not realizing it was a COVID-19 vaccine side effect) who diagnosed me with cranial nerve 4 palsy in the left eye.  I had to notify my job that I was unable to drive and that effected my work. Furthermore it was extremely stressful not knowing the cause or prognosis, and the worry over the medical costs for test and lab work. Since 3/2, the condition has been improving. There have been no other changes to my lifestyle or health that could account for this, other than receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. People need to know about the possibility of horrible side effects like this, it&#39;s worse when you don&#39;t know what&#39;s causing it or the prognosis.

                                                Patient reported in chart notes a history of fainting after vaccinations. Pharmacist asked patient about this before administering vaccine, and patient said she often faints in regards to blood draws or vaccines. Patient was prepared to sit in waiting area for at least 15 minutes. Patient was given vaccine and pharmacist confirmed patient was feeling okay. Patient returned to waiting area to sit, then allegedly decided to stand up and go to the in-window when beginning to feel faint. She fainted in this process. RPh and store manager immediately rushed to patient, who returned to consciousness right away. Patient stated to RPh that she did not hit her head nor did she have any pain in her legs or trouble breathing. She felt  mostly embarrassed. Store manager called paramedics, who arrived, examined patient, and the patient let them leave and proceeded to shop in the store aisles until her husband arrived.

                                                I have asthma that is primarily seasonal or exercise- induced.  About 2 days after the vaccination,  I experienced asthma symptoms that lasted for about 5 days. This was not related to exercise, humidity,  or seasonal allergies- I woke up struggling to breathe on day 3 after the vaccine.  I had shortness of breath,  wheezing,  resulting lightheadedness, and some dry coughing. Symptoms were worst first thing in the morning and at night. I am still experiencing some lingering difficulty breathing 10 days out from the vaccine, but no wheezing.   It is very likely that I had COVID-19 in early February 2020, before testing was available in the here (My coworker returned from abroad very ill; another coworker and I became sick shortly after,  and she lost her sense of taste and smell. I experienced low grade fever,  intense nausea,  diarrhea,  shortness of breath,  and extreme fatigue.  The fatigue lasted for about one month.) Following this illness,  I saw a sharp increase in my asthma symptoms for about 6-7 months,  which gradually tapered off. Again, there was no other trigger for these symptoms such as exercise or humidity. It seems likely that I contracted COVID-19, which damaged my lungs in some way,  and that the vaccine has resulted in irritating or &#34;re-activating&#34; that damage at a lesser intensity.

                                                About 3-4 hours after receiving my second dose of vaccine on 1/30/21, I began to experience side effects including headache, myalgias, and fatigue (which I had also experienced with the first dose of vaccine). I had no nausea or vomiting until around 8-9 pm on 1/31/21. At that time I began to have severe nausea and had 1-2 episodes of emesis before falling asleep. I woke up around 3 am and had another episode of emesis. This continued every 15-30 minutes. I was unable to keep any fluids down as a result. After a couple of hours of this I became lightheaded and began to experience abdominal pain after repeated retching. Sometime between 6 am and 7 am I called 911 and was connected to nursing line. I was advised to go to the emergency department. After vomiting another 2 times I called 911 again and asked for an ambulance to be sent. I vomited again in the ambulance before arrival. Once in the ED I was examined, found to be tachycardic, and started on 1L of IV fluids. I was informed lab tests were being drawn, including pregnancy test, urinalysis, CBC, CMP, and toxicology screen. I was given one dose of Zofran IV. Nausea began to subside, and I was able drink fluids without nausea or vomiting. I was informed that lab tests were unremarkable. Another 1L of IV fluids had been started, but I was disconnected after maintaining PO intake and eventually discharged around 12 pm.

                                                Around 10 am (2hrs post vaccination) I noticed some hives on my hands and dizziness. I also developed a mouth sore that later went away around 5pm. I drank 1.5 L of water and put some topical Benadryl cream on the hives, these symptoms resolved. At 8pm I began to get a temperature (temp max 101.2 around 11:17pm), a very sore swollen arm, massive headache, and myalgia/arthralgia in knees bilaterally. On 1/5 temperature has subsided to low grade (99.2F) but I still don?t feel well and have no sense of smell with a runny nose.

At got better and was normal by day 3.  Today, 7 days from day of injection, I woke up with my left arm (injection side) sore and inflamed, arm was warm to touch and hurt when I pushed. There&#39;s a mass of dense/sore area, sort of feels like a dense lump.  Area around on skin is itchy - has been this way all day. Tonight the swollenness and itchiness is traveling into left armpit as well.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

I believe I was only blacked out for a minute or less but I did hit my nose and bruise it. The next morning I was very tired and had a headache. Along  with the sore arm.

The redness went half way around my deltoid, but did not include the injection site.   I applied ice, took aleve. Over the following 30 hrs, the symptoms dissipated.

                                                Severe arm pain at injection site night of.  At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

                                                1-2 minutes after the vaccine, I got  very hot then my chest got very heavy. I never struggled to breathe, but it was harder to breathe. My pulse and blood pressure went up. I got dizzy and lightheaded. Maybe 5-7 minutes after the onset, it started to get better on its own. No medicine was given. The paramedic did an ekg which was normal. My blood pressure and pulse also went back to normal.  My oxygen level was normal. Later that evening and the following day, the only noticeable difference was extreme fatigue and a headache. I was dizzy and lightheaded for a few hours after.

Diphenhydramine, famotidine, methylprednisolone, and a LR bolus was administered.  Following IM epinephrine administration, the patient&#39;s hemodynamic instability promptly improved along with her mentation.  Patient was monitored for 4.5 hours before being discharged home under the care of her partner with a EpiPen autoinjector kit.

                                                Patient had her first Moderna COVID vaccination at 4:00 PM today and 5 min later felt dizziness, worsening, associated with headache, nausea, sore throat, hot flashes, and dizziness is from side to side when she looks at her phone, no dizziness when she does not look at it. Patient primary complaint is headache on bilateral temples. All other symptoms resolved, and no dizziness if not looking at phone.  Patient has history of headaches, similar in quality, but this is more intense (6/10 intensity, less than her scoliosis pains, but more than usual headache pain), but otherwise the same, pounding sensation, and she can feel throbbing. Headache is about the same currently. Started simultaneously as dizziness, immediately, unchanged. No changes in vision. Peak intensity of headache around 30 min after onset, peak at 4:30 or so.  Patient notified the vaccine clinic staff and was instructed to be observed in another area, and did not improve. Patient remembered that her initial blood pressure was low and it fluctuated. Patient was then sent to the ED.  Upon initial assessment in the Emergency Department 2 hours after her initial injection, the assessment is likely vasovagal near syncope with tension headache, rather than true allergic reaction. Given metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, normal saline, and obtained labs.

                                                About a minute or 2 after receiving the vaccine my heart rate increased. I advised the nurse and they hooked me up to a monitor for my heart rate and O2 levels. My O2 was fine, however my heart increased to about 192 bpm at resting. After a couple minutes it slowed down to a resting rate of 130 This continued for 20 minutes until I took my beta blocker atenolol. After that it would only increase to 150 bpm during an episode and resting rate was 100-115bpm. I had a headache and was a little light headed.

Everything slowly started getting better and I was able to work on the 31st. I developed a headache and body aches for a while. My arm was also sore.

                                                Initially after vaccine within an hour I felt fatigue(drained within 1 hour of receiving vaccine). Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine I was having fever, chills, body aches, nausea, and vomiting, and diarrhea and dizziness and weakness and heart palpitations(probably related to dehydration). Symptoms remained for 3 days. Unable to hold down anything. Felt like I had covid all over again just without the respiratory issues and loss of taste and smell. Arm was very sore almost like a deep bone bruise. Brain fog developed again like after initially recovering from covid as did the fatigue. Still having lingering fatigue and now carpal tunnel like symptoms in both hands, slight weakness and numbness at times in right upper arm where vaccine was given. Reported event to Pharmacist to administered the vaccine and the CDC.

After 24 hours I was super fatigued, had chills, and headache, and arm pain was so bad I could b as reply move it. I had a headache and very sore arm for the next 4-5 days. My symptoms subsided until almost 2 weeks later. The area of the injection became raised, hot, itchy, and sore again. It&#39;s now been 5 days out from symptom onset and the redness has spread to a large part of my upper arm. It is also still itchy and tender to the touch.

Continued though out night. Sunday - same symptoms but less painful (rate it around a 9/10) - went to store to get groceries with husband around 8:30pm and almost passed out, super weak and felt like puking - not sure if it was just the mask making it hard to breathe. Monday - woke drenched in sweat but not as bad as over the weekend, still achy but not as bad, headache, arm is still super sore and enlarged, hot to touch, fatigue, malaise - but able to go to work (pain down to 6/10, so definitely better than before)

                                                As soon as my vaccine was done in my left arm, I bled. I had tingling feeling in my arm, felt like I needed to rest my arm. I was asked to sit down for at least 15mns. The tingling went away, during the night my arm was painful, the next morning I couldn&#39;t lift my arm up due to the pain. The pain in my left arm lasted until Saturday night. Sunday night, I had chills, coughing, my right arm now was hurting, couldn&#39;t not lift it up just like it was in my left arm. Wednesday, January 20th, 2021, the tingling in my left arm was back but this time with my hand shaking, shaking so strongly that it scared me. There was tingling, shaking and felt like I needed to drop my arm.  Thursday January 21st  and Friday January 22nd, my hand kept shaking and felt like I needed to drop my arm. The tingling feeling in my arm has not stop since then and so is the shaking of my hand.

Patient is a nurse.  She received her 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 the day prior to arriving in the emergency department.  This morning she did feel some mild body aches but otherwise was feeling fine.  Starting later today after her shift at work she developed severe body aches bilateral upper shoulders and down her spine, she also reports some shortness of breath, dizziness.  She felt unsafe to drive home feeling like this.  She had taken some Advil earlier in the day around 10:00.  She denies any fever, nausea or vomiting.  No history of severe vaccine reaction or anaphylaxis.  She has had anaphylactic reaction to Enbrel prior.  She denies any throat swelling, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain.    patient is mildly tachycardic and hypertensive.  Likely due to pain.  Patient is experiencing adverse reaction to the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  I discussed with her she is having an immune response to the vaccine.  She does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis which could contribute to the elevated immune response as well.  The patient is given 30 mg of IM Toradol for body aches here in the emergency department.  She is instructed to call PCP for close follow-up, rest, drink plenty of fluids.  She has no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis at this point.

                                                I didn&#39;t have any symptoms other than a sore arm for the first day or two.  On Monday, my left arm started to hurt in a different way.  When I push on it, it is not sore anymore.  Now, when I try to lift my left arm, even a little bit, I have quite a bit of pain internally, in  my upper arm/ shoulder. I feel as though this is not from the actual vaccination, but possibly from how it was administered into my shoulder.  I do realize this is only day 3, but it has gotten worse from yesterday to today.

The pain often stops me from completing tasks such as taking off my shirt or extending my arm in front of me with any type of weight in it (even a water bottle).

They came in waves or rushes for the next hour. Doctor said i look like im getting oxygen and confirmed i had a racing heart. I took lorazepam to calm myself down and doctors concluded it was a panic attack although i know this was something i had never experienced before.

                                                1st shot: no immediate reaction. Racing heart that night. No illness reported, 11 days later I had a small red spot at injection site that was hard and hot to touch but went away on its own in about 1 week. 2nd shot: I had the vaccine on Friday, Feb. 5, 2021 at 5:05p.m. and had immediate reactions. That night I had a racing heart (which I had with the first vaccine)The next morning, Saturday the 6th, I woke up very sick. Symptoms included total body aches, pounding head, loss of appetite, racing heart, general flu like symptoms. I noticed a large red knot/rash on my arm at injection site. By Sunday the 7th, the symptoms had subsided mostly but the knot/rash was larger. Sunday night the knot/rash was even larger, hard and hot to the touch, the redness has darkened. I went to urgent care and they said it was not an infection since I had no pain (just uncomfortable and slightly itchy) they thought it was an allergic reaction and gave me steroids. Monday the 8th (today) the red rash/knot is less dark and hard but larger/wider in size. I had dizziness, lethargy, racing heart and loss of appetite.  I have not worked since Friday the 5th.

I have taken Advil and Tylenol alternating every 4-6hrs. At 12pm I was feeling very dizzy. I took my temperature and it was 95.6 via forehead. I took it twice and took the children&#39;s temps to verify that it was working correctly. I also used an oral thermometer and got 95.7. It is now almost 10pm and I still have a 95.6F temp, chills, body aches, headache and dizziness. At work daily my temperature is consistently 97.5 using a forehead thermometer each morning and after lunch.

She was lightheaded, arms tingling, felt hot then cold. We had her lay down on the floor and held her feet in the air. Within three minutes of doing this, she felt much better. She sat up on the floor and ate some Chex-mix and drank some water. She stayed thirty  minutes and felt good. She left and we made sure she made it home.

My tongue started feeling somewhat funny, my whole body felt very warm, I had some pain in my abdomen on the left side (the side I had the shot), facial flushing, dizziness, headache. I was checked out by the medical staff at 11:25, they determined that I was probably safe to go home. On the way out, I developed itchy lips and hives on my upper lip. The dizziness lasted three days, and was accompanied by severe chills. I took Benadryl after a very nervous ride home. Everything up to the dizziness subsided.

                                                I felt fine after the shot until about 7 pm when I started experience an intense, pressurized sensation in my head, jaw, chest, and arms. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ringing in my ears, and feeling flushed. Over night I felt some numbness in my hands and arms. The next day the feeling of  pressure and tightness was gone but the dizziness and nausea has remained. I have more energy but  am feeling concerned about the persistent vertigo.  I have a history of allergic reactions. I was also scheduled to begin my menstrual cycle this weekend and it has been delayed.

Noted wrist and hand swelling @8pm. After applying ice around 10:30pm pain became suddenly severe with movement. Suspected ice was somehow a mistake and applied heat. Pain became excruciating. Took tylenol XS to sleep.   Tuesday 3/16 - Upon waking Moderate swelling and complete loss of mobility in both hands and wrists. Shooting pain that knocked the breath out of me. Unable to complete any activities of daily living independently (bathing, toileting, eating). Wore carpel tunnel braces all day. Some improvement in range of motion in the evening, able to open and rest hands semi-flat on an angled surface. R hand demonstrating faster improvement than L. Noted mild red bumps present on both wrists (more on L) and mild-moderate shooting pain from L thumb toward inner elbow, more severe in area closer to elbow. Upon rubbing the area close to elbow noted soreness and bumps under skin when applying mild pressure that aren&#39;t visible to the eye.   Wednesday 3/17 - Upon waking Red bumps resolved. Some improvement in all areas. L hand improvements mildly lagging behind the R. Able to complete activities of daily living with supportive assistance. Increased range of motion and moderate pain. More improvement @5pm. Regained 90% range of motion, shooting pains were mild-moderate.   Thursday 3/18 - Upon waking I have full range of motion. Mild-moderate pain with certain angled movements and levels of exertion. PCP telehealth appt @9am. Diagnosis: adverse reaction to moderna. Suspicion that there may be some connection with the complex migraine (though there was no numbness or tingling present) and to update my neurologist (you!). Recommendation was to report it and monitor sx. If sx not completely resolved in one week referral to othopedic.

                                                Patient received dose at 1045am, at 1055am patient reported not feeling well.  At that time I observed patient getting lightheaded, profusely sweating, nauseous, decreased blood pressure, and tightness in chest and throat.  Benadryl was administered and cool rags were applied to patient forehead and legs elevated.  Patient reported feeling better for a couple minutes then everything came back strong. had technician call 911, the EMS squad came and transported her to a local ER for observation.  I spoke with patient later in evening, she reported feeling better and that the ER thinks it was just her, having a panic attack. She reported no other symptoms and was discharged in the afternoon.

My 8 month old daughter then exhibited symptoms the  following Saturday, 03/20. I took her to urgent care to be tested. She tested positive as well. The following Wednesday, 03/24, I had Covid testing for exposure through my employer for day 12 of my husbands case and day 5 of my daughter&#39;s. I took my 3 year old son, both of us asymptomatic at the time, for an exposure test as well. We received positive results that evening. I started to get a headache, congestion, dizziness and some minor muscle pains in my right arm. My 3 year old is still asymptomatic.

The following day, Wednesday, at 5:00 pm I began experiencing Vertigo symptoms that ultimately put me in the ER. after rotating between vomiting and diarrhea every 10 minutes. I was given Zofran 4 MG orally and Meclizine 25 MG to control vertigo. The vertigo was severe and I could not lay down at all and even closing my eyes or changing directions made me nearly fall. It was another 24 hours when vertigo ended and just occasional dizziness remains. Diarrhea lasted until Friday, March 26. I had a CT brain and head scan at 3/25/2021 at 8:42 AM to rule out stroke.

                                                8 days after the shot I had an episode of tingling and numbness bilaterally from my feet up to my thighs. I had difficulty walking, a lot of pain and a vibration sensation in my thighs with weakness. I was admitted to the hospital for 3 days and had abnormal neuro reflexes upon admission and severe brain fog, which I have never had before. MRIs and blood work were done in the hospital but they could not determine the cause and the hospital questioned it being from the COVID vaccination and has had me follow up further with specialists to see if there could be any other diagnostic causes. I have followed up with my PCP, 2 neurologists, a rheumatologist, allergist, dermatologist and will be seeing a hematologist.  (I now have joint pains, extreme fatigue, brain fog, peripheral neuropathy--none of which I had prior to the vaccination and thus far conditions outside of the vaccination have not been found. I also got a positive ANA after vaccination (I had negative in the past and my doctors are questioning if the covid vaccination triggered an autoimmune disorder now in me with the joint pain and swelling, fatigue, positive ANA, rashes and pain).  I have been out of work since February due to health impairments and am a healthcare provider myself.

                                                I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time

Then I got a fever and a feeling of extreme heaviness - like I couldn?t get out of bed, and when I did to get water or go to the bathroom, I was immediately exhausted and incredibly dizzy afterwards. I am able to be up and moving more today, however I still have a fever and extreme cold sweats. My poor partner thought I might have wet the bed my cold sweats were so serious. I had to steady myself a few times walking my kids to their bus stop this morning. I?m afraid to drive to work my ?heaviness feeling? and shakes are so intense. I don?t regret getting vaccinated, but it?s not been fun.

The sight of where the vaccine was administered was red and very swollen. there is a noticeable lifted knot on my arm the size of a gold ball. the sight around the area of administration is red, and sore and warm to touch. the tingling feeling also was present when waking up on Jan 5, 2021.  around 230 pm, my arm still very sore and the knot on my arm is still visible and sore to touch. the tingling feeling slowly starting to subside.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

                                                Immediately following the injection there was injection pain at the site and the muscle function was immediately impacted.  For around 36 hours afterward I was unable to raise my left arm above my shoulder.  After that I was able to do so first with pain, pain subsided after around 48 hours.  Beginning 1/8/2021 I had muscle spasms in my lower left abdomen directly to the right of my left hip bone.  The spasms were not painful, but we?re intrusive and constant.  After around 24 hours they subsided and that region became very sore due to the muscles being overworked by the spasms.  On this day I also developed a headache and low grade fever.  The headache is at its worst when I stand up.  6 days after the vaccination I still have a constant minor headache and get pangs and jolts of pain in the top of my head when I stand up and am nearly constantly fatigued.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

Throughout the day I had persistent fever of up to 101.8F which improved with alternating IBU 800mg and Tylenol 1g, but did not resolve. The severe body pains and headache also lasted all day. Improved but not resolved with medication. My right arm was also severely painful. Could not raise it.  All symptoms resolved by the next morning except for  the arm pain which is much milder, like a 1/10 dull pain but still persistent.

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

I took benadryl (either 25 or 50mg) at night before bed and this did not help the first night, but it helped immensely almost immediately the 2nd night I took it, and then the next morning it had pretty much gone away.

                                                In day one I felt a little off and weak after the injection. This was a few minutes later and lasted about 2 hours. I took a Tylenol PM to sleep, but didn?t sleep well at all. On the second day, in the morning when I woke up the arm where the injection was administered was extremely sore and I couldn?t lift it. It felt almost numb, but I was in pain. I took Advil late morning and felt better but still couldn?t lift my arm above my chest. Around 4-5pm that evening, I was feeling tightness in my chest. Felt like something heavy was sitting on top of me and I developed a headache at this point. I felt super tired so I took an Advil PM to comfortably take a nap. When I woke up I still had a headache and chest tightness. At this point my body started to feel sore. The next day, 1/31/21, I am still feeling fatigued. Headache did not go away or subside. My body still feels sore especially my back, top area (I would say around shoulder blades). I still have chest tightness and had a fever of 101 today. I have taken an Advil for headache and body soreness - after an hour of taking Advil, still feeling the same.

                                                At 1:17 PM, I received the vaccine. Around 1:30 PM I started itching and breaking out in hives. I did not say anything because I thought it was my eczema reacting to my nerves. I went home and felt fine for a while. Around 5:30 PM I told my husband my stomach hurt and I had a slight headache, and I was going to lie down. Around 8:30 PM I woke up. Around 11 PM I was feeling kind of light-headed but did not say anything to my husband because I just thought it was my thoughts. I went to bed. Around 3:45 AM I woke up feeling sick, went to bathroom in master bedroom and dry heaved. I returned to the bed from our bathroom, and told my husband I thought I was going to pass out. I have no recollection of the following events, this is information my husband (Brian) shared with me. He said I then stayed standing on the floor, laid my head over on my pillow, and started breathing heavily, and it became progressively heavier to where he stated I sounded like a &#34;wart hog.&#34; He said he jokingly said to me, &#34;Are you mutating,&#34; then I collapsed onto our bedroom floor. He said he got up immediately, was saying my name as he was walking to me, and I was not responding. He then got on the floor by me, and was rubbing me and trying to wake me, and it took about a minute before I came to. When I came to I was laying on our floor, keep in mind I feel approximately 5 feet as our bed sits 4 to 4.5 feet in the air, and I am 5&#39;8&#34;. I hit my hit on our floor, and when I came to I could barely hear him calling my name as there was a loud rushing noise like water in my head. It took about 2-3 minutes before the ringing was completely gone. I then had cold chills off and on for the next 24 hours with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. On Tuesday following the initial encounter, I went to the ER due to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe headache on right side of head. The ER doctor diagnosed me after a CT with a closed head injury that occurred at initial encounter, so Thursday around 4 AM.

                                                I initially had a sore arm which was anticipated but a few days later I noticed pain from a swollen lymph node(s) in the same armpit (about 3-4 days later) which lasted several days. Over the next few days I experienced diarrhea, weakness, fatigue, extreme neck pain (on the same side as the injection), swelling and redness of my arm at the injection site (9 days after), a few hives on my face. It is currently 2 weeks after I&#39;ve received the vaccine and I feel extreme muscle aches, slight headache, and pain in my upper abdomen and back. I was in very good shape prior to receiving this vaccine but now when I go to the gym I cannot lift as much as I could before, nor do I have energy like I did prior to the vaccine.

                                                Several hours after vaccine administration, I began to get a headache. That headache intensified over the next 24-36 hours. A severe headache resulted with a painful, stiff neck, occasional fever, occasional diarrhea, confusion, vision changes, and increased imbalance. These symptoms lasted for about 1 week before I sought medical treatment at a virtual urgent care appointment on 1/5/21. They referred me to an in-person urgent care facility that day. At that facility, they said my symptoms were very concerning and said I needed to seek immediate medical assistance at the ED and offered to call me an ambulance. My husband drove me to the ED from the urgent care facility. At the ED, they treated me with a migraine work-up but eventually discharged me with instructions to follow-up as I was &#34;diagnostically unclear&#34; at discharge. After a week, my symptoms had not improved at all and so my previous ED physician suggested that I return to the ED (after being unable to get care in a timely manner in an outpatient setting). At the ED on 1/12/21, they again treated me with a migraine workup but also conducted a CT scan and a COVID test. When both tests came back negative, they conducted a lumbar puncture procedure. Those results came back positive for viral meningitis. As I had no other illness or known exposure to any other virus at that time - and given the timeframe of the vaccine administration - my care team concluded that this was a rare reaction to the COVID vaccine. I was discharged with instructions to follow up with my PCP and a neurologist. My follow-up neurology consult is scheduled for 2/19/21.

I had severe headaches and vertigo by the next morning, nausea, and debilitating joint pain. By day 3, I continued experiencing headaches and spontaneous vertigo. I have been extremely tired and can sleep for hours.  Day 4, I was feeling much better. I went out that night, and after only 2 drinks, the vertigo came back so badly, I wasn&#39;t able to drive home. For the following days till today, I am still experiencing terrible headaches that will not even lessen with medication, spontaneous vertigo although they don&#39;t last too long any more, and I am extremely tired all the time.

                                                Body aches and chills the following morning after receiving the vaccination.  I was very sluggish and remained in bed for the majority of the day.    I also had a lot of pain at the injection site and couldn&#39;t lift my arm.  Tylenol resolved the issues for the most part but it was only effective for about three hours prompting me to wait an additional 2-3 hours with the symptoms.   This lasted 24 hours and I felt good as new the following day with minor pain at the injection site.

I woke up around 5:30am full body sweating, I only took some aleeve cold and sinus last night and this morning.  This morning around 11:00am the side effects lessened greatly.

She later relocated. 1 hour later, she reported feeling dizzy again and had a tingly face and lips. Was given 1 tablet 25mg diphenhydramine. After 30 more minutes, she felt fine and all symptoms had resolved.

On Saturday I felt better but started to get right ear pain. I went to urgent care on Monday and was diagnosed with an ear infection and was given antibiotics (Amoxicillin). The ear pain did not improve and I went to another doctor on Friday who confirmed that I had an ear infection and he prescribed me with Amoxicillin-CLAV. He said if my symptoms didn&#39;t improve to see a specialist. Yesterday (3/1/21) I started having vertigo and am having difficulty with balancing, especially if I turn my head too quickly. Since Saturday Feb. 20, I have been experiencing tinnitus, ear pain, jaw pain, a feeling of pressure/fullness in the ear, and can&#39;t hear properly. I am also experiencing jaw tightness and pain.

                                                Around 10:00-11:00 pm on 03/02/2021, I woke up with extreme soreness on left arm bicep (where injection was received and all over bicep). I kept waking up about every hour will chills and sweats as well as muscle and joint aches. From this time until approximately 7am, I used the restroom and urinated approximately 5 times. On an average night, I may use the restroom/urinate once at the most around 5-6AM.  This is usually only because the dog wakes me up to let her out at that time. At approximately 4am I took 40 mg (two 20mg pills) of DextroAmp-Amphet.  At 7am I attempted to shower for work. During my shower I couldn?t barely lift my arm to wash with out severe soreness. I also became very dizzy and nauseous. I had to get out and sit in front of the toilet because I thought I would vomit. Fortunately I did not. I then proceeded to crawl back into bed and call in to work (notifying them I was too sick to come in). I had extreme chills, muscle aches, and joint pain. I began to cry from hurting so bad. At approximately 7:45 I took 400mg of ibuprofen to help relieve symptoms. My body felt feverish (hot/clammy).  Around 8am I mustered up the strength to get dressed due to extreme chills. I then proceeded to eat a banana, peach yogurt, and a blueberry Benvita breakfast bar package with 4 wafers.  I then took a nap and have been laying in bed ever since until approximately 4:30 PM (with the exception of getup twice to urinate). My body hurt so bad, I barely moved. At approximately 4:30PM I got up to get orange juice and take 600 mg of ibuprofen.

When it continued to get worse, I went to the dr about 3 weeks after my first shot and was diagnosed with labyrinthitis. My symptoms continued to worsen, and I now have severe hearing loss as well as 75% loss of vestibular function (diagnosed by ENT and audiologist) with constant vertigo. My current diagnosis is labyrinthitis, however I&#39;m also getting an MRI in 2 days to rule out other possibilities.

Went home from work and at 6 pm had a fever that reached 101.  Around 8:30 pm lost feeling on the left side of my face.  I could move my lips but I lost feeling in the left side of my face.   March 5th (2 days after vaccine)-Most symptoms subsided.  Left side of my face still slightly numb by my mouth but mostly resolved.  Fever was gone but still experienced fatigue.  Arm was slightly sore but a huge improvement from the day before.  Cough subsided as well. March 6th (3 days after vaccine)-Slightly sore arm and lingering fatigue.  Felt better than Friday, March 5th. March 6th-8th-Slightly sore arm but all other symptoms went away.

Sudden onset.  Had to leave work in tears everything hurt. While I  do not have any known immune deficiencies, I do have pain problems from my  time in the military, frequent migraines and two discectomy/laminectomys in 2014.  Everything hurt, like I couldn&#39;t move or touch anything, my cats would step on  me while I was in bed and I would cry. This episode lasted till 0230 in the morning, after the 2nd shot that pain episdone lasted from 0730 pm to 1030 the next day.  Never have I ever  have felt such pain and now I have had  two episodes.

                                                Day of injection after I left the vaccination site I started to have a really bad headache and then sore arm (left arm where the injection was). Then about 7 hours after the injection I started to have a really bad stomach ache and cramps with nausea. This last all night long into the next day where it slowly went away. I was incredibly fatigued and the headache would not break. Then on the 3rd day Thursday January 7 I was feeling okay but not 100% myself. Then Friday January 08 I woke up and knew something was incredibly wrong because my stomach hurt way worse then before, i was so lethargic that I was falling asleep at my desk at work, I was shaking  uncontrollably, blurred vision, diarrhea with blood in stool and one close episode of fainting.  So at the point I ended up in the ER missing the rest of my work day. My symptoms didn&#39;t get better until the following Monday

Went into the ER and was admitted to the hospital for monitoring. Doctors changed medication to an antiarrythmic beta blocker, Sotalol (80mg 2x/day). Still being monitored in the hospital to make sure that I tolerate the drug.   I had not had a cardiac event since by initial one in March 2019.

                                                1/23/2021 - The first Moderna vaccine. I had flu like symptoms, which included fatigue, muscles aches, muscle spasms, joint aches, chills, and shortness of breath for 2-3 days afterward.  2/20/2021 - The second Moderna vaccine. The side effects were much worse, including muscle aches, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, chills,  fatigue, and shortness of breath. I also found myself limping. 2/21, 2/22, 2/23 - I rested and stayed home from work. Most of my symptoms had improved by the evening of the 23rd, and I felt like the shortness of breath was also improving if I took it easy.  2/24 - I went to work where the shortness of breath became much worse after working for a couple of hours. I began to get dizzy, and my hands and feet were cold and tingling. The school nurse checked my temperature (which was normal) and oxygen levels (99%). I was sent home and told to take another day or two off.  I was fine if I was sitting still and doing nothing, but talking caused me to become winded. Walking and exertion of any kind caused me to become winded. Once winded, it would take 15 minutes of sitting still to get my breathing back under control. Then I would be hit by a wave of fatigue. Also, when my breathing was bad, I walked with a limp. 2/25 - I went to  the shortness of breath was still bad. They were concerned. They took a chest x-ray (which came back clear), did blood work (which was normal), and gave me a Rapid Covid test (which was negative). My oxygen levels were at 99%. They prescribed a 6 day pack of MethylPREDNISolon. If I was not better by Saturday, they wanted me to return. They also did a PCR test (this came back negative on 2/28).  2/26 - The steroid did not help, and by the evening, I was worse.  I went to the ER . The doctors there were concerned about a pulmonary embolism. They did blood work (which was normal), a chest x-ray (which came back clear), and an EKG (which was normal). My vitals were good, though my blood pressure was high for me (113/64). The doctor told me to continue the steroid pack and prescribed an albuterol inhaler. I was directed to contact a pulmonary specialist on 3/1 if symptoms did not improve. The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/5. 3/1 - The shortness of breath did not improve. I almost passed out while driving after I picked up my two small children from school. I could not catch my breath in the car and started to get lightheaded. When I parked, I stayed in the car huffing and puffing for several minutes. I was seeing spot, was dizzy, and my hands and feet were tingling. When I climbed out of the car, my legs buckled beneath me. I was able to grab onto the car and not fall. I had some really bad breathing episodes between 3/1-and 3/3. At these times, the breathing was so rough, that I couldn?t even talk. It would take 30 minutes or more of sitting still for me to be able to bring my breathing under control. 3/3 - Appointment with Pulmonary Specialist. I had an appointment  He ruled out asthma, as the inhaler and steroid were both ineffective. He considered anxiety, but the problem was clearly not a panic or anxiety attack. (I have experienced those before and know the difference.) He ruled that out. He ran a pulmonary function test (which was normal) and a CT scan with contrast (which was normal). The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/10.  3/4 and on - My breathing was better some days than others. The less energy I exerted, the better I did. If I did too much one day, my breathing would be worse the next day.  3/7 - Ajovy injection. I was past due for this monthly injection. Once injected, I had an allergic reaction to it for the first time ever (this was the 7th time I used it). A few minutes after the injection, the injection area had a rash and was itching like crazy. I put ice on it and took benadryl. It was fine by the next morning.  3/9 - Appointment #2 with Pulmonary Specialist. The specialist was not sure what the problem was with my breathing. I was the first patient with these vaccine side effects that he had seen. He scheduled more tests and said he wanted to read more literature. He wrote a note for me to work from home through 4/6.

                                                Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration The woman who administered the vaccine injected way too high and into my shoulder (not the deltoid muscle) I immediately felt a shooting pain. As soon as she was done injecting me she went to the cafeteria for lunch (maybe she was rushing?). I asked two other workers there why she injected it so high and if it will be ok and they responded with ?maybe she aimed down and still made it into the muscle, it should be fine.? I could hardly move my arm for days. Now I have a limited range of motion because of the pain, and my shoulder feels very heavy and tight. There is a bruise where she injected into my shoulder and it?s still very hard to lift my arm and it?s been 11 days. When I do lift or move it you can hear clicking/popping sounds and it is very painful.  I believe she injected vaccine into my Bursa. I never had any shoulder pain or issue before this.

After observing patient and asking a few questions (no difficulty breathing or swallowing, no injection site soreness or swelling), I decided to give her 25 mg of diphenhydramine syrup at 3:15.  Gave her a cup of water.   3:28 : BP  was 155/93 P 88 R-16.  Patient feeling lightheaded and still flushing at 3:33, so I gave another 25 mg of diphenhydramine (after deciding 180lb required 50mg diphenhydramine).    3:53 BP was 133/87 P 73.  4:05 Patient reported feeling better.   Patient left at 4:20.  Patient was instructed to call 911 if symptoms arose again.

                                                My arm started hurting a bit in the evening, but had no issues going to bed.  I woke up in the middle of the night around 1am, shivering, with chills and my teeth clattering.  I was so cold, I had to put on socks and was using two blankets.  I went to the bathroom and was very dizzy that I almost fell twice.  I also noticed my lips were blue/purple and my temperature was 99.9.  I struggled to go back to sleep because I was still very cold, but also very tired and felt my body drained of energy and had the most intense headache ever.  I felt my head throbbing and like it was about to explode.  I was still cold, dizzy and with a headache the next day.  Two days later, I still had a headache but lighter.  Took Tylenol since Friday night, but I did not feel a difference.  I missed two days of work because of my symptoms.

The pins and needles progressed to loss of sensation and weakness. By 2/29/21 I woke up feeling weak in my limbs with difficulty walking and with balance. MRI of neck and head reveal not issues. Lumbar puncture showed no signs of infection or autoimmune markers but white blood cells and lymphocytes were elevated in spinal fluid. I began to experience increased fatigue and debilitating headaches 3/30/21 for about 1 week. I was prescribed 50mg Predsidone for aseptic meningitis. My symptoms subsided while on medication but have since returned. I experience pain, and pins and needles in my limbs and back, particularly in my hands, feet, and buttock when any amount of pressure is applied for an extended period of time.

                                                I received the vaccine on December 29th, 2020. The vaccinated arm didn&#39;t really hurt until the next morning when I woke up I could barely move my arm.  Around 10:00am  I started getting chills and having sweats. Over the next hour I became severely fatigued even with taking my adderall that morning. My body started tingling, I felt dissociated, had a headache, and a little light headed. Almost a little drunk feeling. I went home from work and slept most of the day.  When I woke up in the evening around 9pm I was sweaty, and my muscles and joints hurt. I took my temperature and it was  100.6.  The next morning on December 31st I no longer had a fever. My temperature was 98. something. The next several days and even now I continue to feel severely fatigued, and slightly dissociated. However, each day I seem to feel the side effects a little less.

                                                She has had intermittent fatigue since receiving the vaccine, which is slowly improving. She had significant pain after receiving the vaccine which resolved in a day or two. She was unable to move the arm the evening after receiving the vaccine (feeling completely asleep), but has gained full strength. She continues to have paresthesias (like the arm feeling asleep or bugs crawling) to the forearm and her entire hand. She did take diphenhdyramine and isn&#39;t certain if it improved the paresthesias, but it did make her fall asleep. Two to three days ago (about 6 days after receiving the vaccine), she developed a cellulitis about 5 cm distal to the vaccine site without systemic symptoms for clinically apparent abscess.

Took PM meds and went to bed. Awoke around 3am with a temp of 103, joint aches, muscle aches, chills, congestion, eyes very dry and itchy,  severe headache/migraine with photosensitivity, fatigue on 1/8/21. Left arm was swollen, hot to the touch and very tender to move it. Took Tylenol and Benadryl to help relieve symptoms. Put a heating pad on injection site. Felt about the same all day so I rested.

                                                Vaccine administered around 5:30pm Thursday, January 7th. Severe site pain within the first few hours of receiving vaccine, lasting about 48 straight hours. Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine, my entire body began to ache and by the next morning I could hardly get out of bed due to the pain in my muscles. They felt like they had tightened or seized up. I could not take a step without wincing. Body chills came next, though I was unable to get out of bed to get my  thermometer from the bathroom. By Saturday morning, I had more range of motion in my extremities, but it was not until Sunday evening that I could lift my left arm (the one the received the inoculation) over my head. There was a red, circular non-irritating rash surrounding the site of injection for 5 days following injection. I have no allergies to any medications, but did test positive for the Covid virus on March 18th, 2020. I realize my body&#39;s reaction was a normal physiologic response to the antibodies my body created within the last 9 months, however I am an otherwise healthy 34 year old female and wanted to report my experience because I could not find evidence that anyone else has had the same experience following the first dose of the covid vaccine.

                                                I received my vaccination at approximately 7pm on Friday January 15th. Upon receiving my vaccinations I felt light headed, but after fifteen minutes I was okay to stand up and leave the facility. At around 12:05am  I began coughing and body aches and it continued throughout the night. By morning my cough had subsided, and I felt okay. By 11:30 am on 16th my body and skin began to tingle all over and I felt a burning sensation under my skin. My head began pound and a feeling of nausea came over me. I started feeling very warm about 10 minutes later and decided to take off my sweater and found that I had a large red rash across my chest. My temperature began to rise and my tongue and face began to swell and a feeling of shortness of breath came over me. By 4:00 my fever hit 104.2 and my body began to stiffen up  and my jaw began to clench involuntarily In small bursts for a total of what my family believes to have been 5-10 minutes. After taking 1000 mg of Tylenol my fever dropped to 103 for the next two hours and I began to shake uncontrollably, then it began to spike a again reaching 103.6. My spouse put cold towels on me and opened the windows to our bedroom to cool me down. Slowly my temperature started dropping and it finally reached 101 by 11pm. The next morning, Sunday, I woke with blisters on my mouth and severe body aches.

She sat on a bench and a staff member brought her back to the clinic in a wheel chair. She reports she has had lots of stress lately, so wonders if it was a stress response. Pt was pale but no diaphoresis, SOB, angioedema, or other worrisome sx. Drank 8 oz juice and recovered well.

Pain in constant and does not subside with any Advil or cold compress.  My doctor prescribed a pain patch which is not helping at all, as well as  ibprofein 800 which is also not working. Made an appointment with  an orthopedic surgeon since pain is not going away and is getting worse.

                                                The night after the shot, I woke up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain in my L arm. I couldn?t touch it in any way, let alone move it or lay on it. The next morning when I got up, I could not move my arm whatsoever and it was one of the worst pains I?ve ever felt. Even superficial touch to the skin anywhere on my deltoid/shoulder/bicep made me jump to the ceiling in pain. Around noon (so almost 24hrs after the shot), I developed a 100* fever, severe aches, chills, and my arm hurt worse and worse. I felt like I needed an arm/shoulder brace it hurt so bad and this went on the whole day. The next day (Tues), my arm hurt a little less but my entire deltoid was bright red, warm to the touch, enlarged, and still painful although not as much as before. As an RN, I?ve never seen or felt a reaction like this to a vaccine/medication. I?ve never reacted to anything like this before.  Oddly when I received the vaccine, I didn?t feel the injection at all.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I began feeling an increase in heart rate about 5-8 minutes after injection. I reported symptoms and site began to monitor my pulse, which was 160. I then drank 32oz of water and took 400mg ibuprofen. I then began to feel dizziness. Blood pressure was normal. My chair was reclined and I was given about 2oz of orange juice. I was then moved to a stretcher and my legs were elevated on a chair. I took a restroom break. I began by walking, but started to see spots in my vision and sat in a wheelchair. I was able to use the restroom and return to stretcher and elevation of my legs. I was then taken to the ER. I used the restroom once more independently. Blood sample was taken. Heart rate was  160, blood pressure was normal. EKG was abnormal and I was given dosage of adenosine. First dose did not show necessary improvement and I was given a second dose, which dropped my heart rate to the 90s. I used the restroom independently and was given an additional EKG, which was normal. During this time my Physician contacted a Cardiologist, for consultation. I was then discharged with recommendation to follow up with cardiologist in 2-4 days.

I was nauseated, weak, tired, and had muscles aches and a horrible headache. I had taken ibuprofen at 4a with no relief. At 7a I took Tylenol and did get some relief from all but the headache until the Tylenol wore off about 12p. At 1p I took more Tylenol and this time the relief wasn?t as much. I wound up bed with chills, fatigue, body aches, nausea, and headache for the next 8 hours. I took more Tylenol (1000mg), ibuprofen (400mg), and a Benadryl (25mg) at 9p in hopes of getting some sleep. At 10p I woke up overly hot from the 3 blankets on me. My temp was 101.5 at that time. I was able to go back to sleep and woke up with only some weakness and muscle aches in the morning.

                                                After I received the vaccine I felt fine. Later that night I had a slight headache and the injection site was sore. I took my medicine and went to bed. I woke in the middle of the night in serve pain at the injection site and still had a headache.  I went back to sleep. I woke at 8am  feeling nauseous and I started trying to walk to the bathroom and tried to throw up. I passed out my husband caught me. He sat me up and put water on face. He called the 911. EMS came out and checked my blood pressure was really low 80/60 range. The night before I checked my blood pressure before taking my blood pressure pill and it was 121/80.  Refused to go to the hospital and I stayed at home and just rested for a couple of hours. I went to work later that night. Every since then I have been feeling weak, dizzy, and moving slow. I feel like it I turn to fast I will fall. I have not been feeling myself.   Just got new insurance and has been trying to find a new doctor and she has been unsuccessful. She is going to urgent care tomorrow.

The pregnancy symptoms stopped as well, and i have an appointment on Feb 5th for a checkup with my doctor to check the baby.

However, speaking to my co workers, their painful arm went away after 2 or 3 days.  Mine still hurts over a week afterwards.  I got my vaccine on a Saturday. Wednesday night, I started feeling pain in my armpit.  It has continued and not stopped.  Feeling around, it feels like my lymph nodes are swollen under my armpit.   Saturday night (a week now after the vaccine), the vaccination site on my arm started itching unbelievably. Nothing would help it. It subsided by Sunday morning but now I noticed the skin around my vaccination site is pink/red.  Not infected looking, just like the coloring of the skin is different, almost like  a sunburn.  Again, still have painful, swollen lymph nodes under my arm and my armpit hurts when I move my arm.

This was mostly resolved within 48 hours.  72 hours after the injection I had a silver dollar sized area of redness, erythema and itching. This resolved over the course of the next two days.  I had daily headaches for around 7 days.   11 days after receiving  the injection I developed a large area of redness, erythema, itchiness and hives over the injection site (around 3 inches in diameter). I have not noticed any other systemic symptoms besides that.

                                                Tiredness, body aches within first 12 hours. By almost 48 hours, I had numbness down the whole left side of the body. This was in the evening, I was not laying on that side of the body in bed but I could barely move that side. Afterwards, I had a slot of pain at the injection site and needed to use a cold compress to settle the swelling and pain.

Also reported neck pain, chest/throat tightness, slightly itchy throat, clogged ears, and a cold feeling. I took her BP and it was elevated at 156/94. I monitored patient over the next 30-35 minutes and she asked for water and crackers. She was not having any difficulty breathing, did not complain of throat closing so epi pen was NOT administered. She slowly improved over those 30-35 minutes. She declined me calling 911. She left with her boyfriend approx 45 minutes after onset of symptoms. I called her at approx 7pm the same night and she reported feeling &#34;fine&#34;.

I could only lift my left arm a quarter of the way extending upward and used an ice pack for several hours. The heat from site progressed and could be felt through my clothes.  Around 9pm I began feeling a little hot and nauseous, temperature was 101.4. About five minutes later I had a bad case of chills (slept in sweatpants, hoodie, comforter, and fleece blanket). Took 2 Tylenol, went to bed and woke up afebrile. No changes to swelling in arm at this time

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the shot, I started having intense dizziness, and nausea, and my body felt very hot. My eyes teared up  as well.  This feeling subsided a little after 15 more minutes, so I went home.  At home (and within 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine), the lymph nodes in my throat swelled considerably and I had great difficulty speaking.  Having experienced anaphylaxis in the past, this was not anaphylaxis but something else entirely - it was like my vocal cords were paralyzed.  I took ibuprofen to help with the swelling, but it did not seem to impact my throat or ability to speak. About 4 hours later my throat muscles seemed to loosen and I was able to speak fairly normally again.

I also started feeling tightness in my chest during inhalation. I took 2 Acetaminophen pills, 500mg each.  It helped with the flu like symptoms yet the injection site was (and still is a week later) warm, raised, very tender and itches.  One week after the vaccination I started feeling malaise and queasy. I took Tylenol again to help symptoms (two 500mg each) and did help. I did that twice, 5 hours apart. A week and one day right now and still don?t feel completely back to normal, no change to my left arm.

                                                I had a vasovagal response- vasodilation. I felt hot, flushed, nauseous, then it developed into feeling dizzy and feeling like I might be sick. I was brought outside and asked to lay flat on the ground and I felt much better. The doctor came out to check on me and said that I looked pale, and that my blood pressure had dropped and asked if this has happened before and if I exercise regularly. After laying down for a little bit, I was guided to sit up slowly as I felt ready. Later that evening within 3 hours or so from the injection, I felt joint pain, and nerve &#34;pinches&#34; throughout my body. This continued through the night and into the next day 2/3/2021. These nerve pinches were mostly on my hands, left wrist, feet, legs, and jumped around a bit throughout my body-shoulder, back etc. I&#39;ve experiences sciatica and other nerve pain before so know what nerve pain &#34;pinches&#34; feel like,

Lasted for approximately eight hours after receiving vaccine. I had to call off of work for the rest of the day.

Two previous pregnancies with healthy, live births (5/2015 and 2/2018). Received vaccination Tuesday 1/26 at 4 pm. Feeling tired by 9 pm. Had difficulty sleeping over night and bizarre dreams when I did fall asleep. Wednesday had moderate symptoms all day - fatigue, dizziness, body aches, joint pain, chills and hot flashes (no fever), nausea, and headache. Thursday morning (1/28), symptoms were more mild, but noticed urine was dark. By early afternoon, urine had gotten much more dark and looked to be blood in urine. Went to OB provider who confirmed blood in urine and urine sent out for culture, no infection found. Unknown cause of blood in urine. Headache has continued since 1/27, worse in the morning.

                                                The day of the injection I had a very sore arm, just like my first dose. Then around quarter after midnight, I got up to use the bathroom. I recall extremely vivid dreams, and a little bit of disorientation. On my way back to bed I thought I?d take another ibuprofen to help me sleep because my arm was so sore. I remember feeling very dizzy, I did take my pill, and then I woke up on the floor. I was extremely disoriented and there was a shrill ringing in my left ear. As I came to, I recall really finding relief in the cold tile, and being concerned that I may have hit my head. I did a mental scan of my body and nothing felt painful, though stiff and sore, as I had the flu. I got back in bed and looked at the time, about 20 minutes had elapsed. The rest of the night I tossed turned, and felt quite feverish. I attempted to find radial and carotid pulses, which were extremely weak. That night, I  never did get a temperature, because I was quite disoriented. This morning I?ve been quite stiff and low energy. I feel discomfort in my kidneys, and have taken care to stay hydrated. I have reduced appetite, and some achiness in my body. My temperature right now is 100 even. It?s almost 3 o?clock, so about 28 hours has elapsed. I did not seek further medical care, as I live alone and transportation i would be a hurdle. I also not super concerned, mostly I just want you all to document that I painted, as I have not found that to be listed as a common side effect for the Moderna vaccine. I did call up a friend who is a paramedic, and feel reassured by her two cents.

                                                I am the patient. I do not have the lot number. I received it and was fine initially. I felt a little euphoric in my head. Light headed I guess you could say. After about 10 mins of that I felt a little sensation in my legs. It did not last long. I thought maybe just nerves. After about 15-20 minutes I walked outside to maybe leave. I started feeling a little Soreness (none painful or severe) in my throat. I looked in the mirror and saw two small red patches in the very back of the throat. I looked at my phone to text who followed me and looked back in the mirror to see they had no connected that quickly. With in 10 seconds. I walked back in and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl. I could still breath and had a good air way. My throat a little tight. I remember feeling this euphoric feeling in my head. After about 15 mins of the Benadryl I was getting bettter. I hung around for a little while and left. I know it was a allergy but honestly considered going back for the second dose of that is how it could be handled again. I felt some small dull none painful sharp pains if that makes sense in my sides and stomach that didn?t not linger. Over all it wasn?t so bad. This is my first day however and if more arises I?ll be sure to let you know. I did experience a very sore arm tonight. To even lift it hurt. Worse than other vaccines. I have never had any reactions to other vaccines.

I grabbed an epinephrine injector and went to assist.  When I got close to pt she started to pass out.   911 was called and pt was administered a dose of epinephrine and she revived enough to speak coherently.  Shortly after emts arrived and took pt to hospital.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

Squeezing sensation self-resolved after call. Paramedics arrived about 1 hr post-vaccination. BP 89/66. (Note my normal BP runs 90-110s/50s-70s.) HR 70s-90s. Pulse Ox high 90s. Paramedics not concerned that reaction was allergic, no rescue meds advised. I felt well enough to drive home despite persisting facial tingling and tight breathing. Allegra and albuterol taken upon arrival home, resolved breathing but not facial tingling. Facial tingling better but not resolved after about 24 hrs.

I woke up around 6 AM the following day and felt extremely fatigued. Around 6:30 AM I became nauseous and very lightheaded. I had to brace myself against a counter so I would not fall down and faint. I rested all day then around 1 PM I got up and fainted. I woke up a moment later and had an intense ringing in my ears for several minutes. I felt fatigued the rest of the day.

This pain lasted until about 2:00 a.m.on 2/27/21. Chills developed around 11:00 a.m. on 2/26/21, then a fever that got to 100.7 around 12:00 p.m. the same day. Both effects lasted until about 2:00 a.m. 2/27/21. A headache started about 6:00 a.m. on 2/27/21 and got worse in the evening and following morning. I have also felt fatigue and a little off balance for the duration of all these symptoms.

Some splotchy redness was still noted on my back up to 7 hours after first noticed.

My head was pounding with heart beat. I began to see ?stars? and feeling lightheaded. Lasted 30min. They had me lay down and bend my knees. Then felt nausea. Drank water. After leaving I had intense shaking that eventually went away after about 30min.

I informed patients that if they wanted to, they can both enter room together. Both patients were counseled on side effects/ what to expect. Patient was administered the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine first in left arm. Upon vaccination, patient&#39;s arm began to bleed from injection site. I informed patient I would clean her arm, and attempted to hold gauze in place myself. Patient stated she would hold the gauze instead. After applying bandaid and cleaning area, I began process to vaccinate her husband. While vaccinating husband, patient stated she felt dizzy/faint. Patient sat in chair. Husband stated she is prone to fainting spells. I offered EMS services.Husband refused. I elevated patient&#39;s legs with other chair. Patient started to become non-responsive.  I stated I would use an epi-pen. Patient&#39;s husband refused epipen. Informed technician, to contact 911. Informed technician to contact front end manager. Patient continued to be non-responsive. Asked husband if I should get patient juice. Ran to get patient orange juice and straw. Husband wet patient with water. Patient started drinking orange juice through straw. Felt better. Started becoming responsive. PAtient and husband waited for EMS. Refused EMS services.

She had low blood pressure, was pale, and had difficulty seeing clearly. EMS came to the scene to evaluate and her blood pressure recovered and she went home. She did not go to the emergency room, was just treated by EMS. She remained conscious and breathing and did not require CPR.

                                                Of course I had side effects like aches, bone pain (mainly spine and sternum), kidney pain, abdominal pain, sweating with no fever, etc. But none of that is an adverse effect.  The adverse effect happened when I was taking a shower 45 hours after my second vaccine. I was starting to feel better at this point. I started to feel like I was going to pass out. I quickly turned off my shower and sat down. I would have passed out had I not focused to not. I felt nauseous, lost my hearing and started to lose my sight. After I was ok, my lips were blue/Gray. I don&#39;t pass out. I&#39;ve passed out twice in my life when I was much younger. That&#39;s how I knew what was happening. I&#39;m scared this will happen again and I don&#39;t know what this means.

It began only when I would roll over at night after falling asleep.  A week later it began as soon as I lay my head down or rolled over.  Now it can hit when I&#39;m awake and upright such as at work.

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

                                                Patient reported a metallic taste in mouth right after administration of vaccine. She then reported a funny feeling in her throat. Pharmacist gave her Claritin 10mg  (5-7 min post vaccination). She has experienced seizures in the past and felt like one was coming on. She had nausea, light headedness, cooling sensations. She was given some water and then asked for pepto bismol, which we gave her (10-15 min) post vaccination. She then started getting hives on neck and eye. She wanted an ambulance called, we did. She started getting tingles on both arms and neck. Felt a sensation like someone sprayed water near her on her neck. Ambulance arrived and by that time she was feeling better and hives were leaving.  Paramedics checked her out and she declined going to hospital. Headache started when paramedics were assessing her. She had a friend come pick her up and take her home, to monitor her.

After 1.5 hours I felt very weightless and felt like I was going to pass out.  Then a wave of nausea came over me.  That went back and forth for about 20 minutes.  The following 2 days, I had those same rounds of nausea and thinking I&#39;m going to pass out.  My left arm got a large red, itchy and red bump and red streaks going up my arm.

When I sat down, my blood pressure dropped and the room started spinning and I could feel that I was going to lose consciousness. My husband came to help and watched as I passed out cold on the toilet for over a minute. 15 hours after receiving the shot, I passed out again on the toilet with the same symptoms before losing consciousness. I was unable to get up without passing out for over 16 hours after receiving the shot. I had continued dizziness and muscle weakness for over 24 hours, along with flu-like symptoms as expected.

I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

She then reported feeling lightheaded and tingling in her lips. I assisted her to the floor and had her lay down. She reported feeling feverish and she was warm to the touch, but her temperature was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Her O2 was at 99%. She briefly lost consciousness around 6:55pm as evidenced by her not responding to my questions or to me roughly shaking her arm. She regained consciousness within a couple seconds. Patient then reported a sudden headache at 6:57pm. EMS arrived at 7:01pm. The patient left with EMS.

                                                I had the standard side effects starting about 20 hours after my 2nd dose on 3/26/2021 of Moderna (low grade fever, chills, sweats, nausea, body aches, stiff neck on the left side, sore arm (left side), but I also had very swollen lypmh nodes in my armpit area on the left side and a bad rash. I reported to my doctor who told me to do cold compresses and hydrocortisone a few times a day and after 3-4 days that went away.  Since the 1st dose on 2/25/2021, I have had random muscle aches in my legs, stiff/sore neck on the left side, and my arm is sore maybe every 2-3 days at the injection site (the arm soreness happened moreso after the 2nd dose though). I also have a stiff toe on my right foot (2nd toe in next to my pinky toe) when I walk on it; when I grab my toe to feel for an injury or check for bruising, there is nothing and it feels normal. It&#39;s only when I walk on it does it randomly hurt throughout the day. I am not certain if this is coincidental or related but wanted to also include this since it started 2-3 days after my 2nd dose.

I suffer from chronic migraines but this way way more intense than my normal ones. the pain was all over my head, I had vision changes being very blurry and cloudy. the pain shot all the way down my neck. i had to go to urgent care expecting to get a toradol shot and go home. instead was sent via ambulance to the ER in fear i may have had a bleed. i ended up in the ER on saturday 4/24/21. they never gave me a CAT scan i was sent over there for. instead made me sit there for 2 hours in room before being seen. then came in said here&#39;s some meds and made me wait another 2 hours. i was discharged faster than it took them to take my copay for the visit! so for having a blinding headache for 2 days they didnt take it very seriously. on top of the headache i had sever muscle and joint pain to the point i couldnt move. i couldnt keep food down either.

I told my husband who had also been vaccinated that I thought something was wrong and within a seconds I then passed out and he caught me. I vomited twice in the span of the next ten minutes and I was not alert for any of that time-no recollection of being able to see or hear. My husband stated my eyes were open and pupils very  dilated. He was able to get me to the ground with the help of the pharmacist who had administered the vaccine. 911 was called and by the time they arrived I became coherent enough to talk and interact. I declined a hospital visit because I had no interest in a ambulance ride but did follow up with my primary. No history of ever fainting or medical anxiety.

This redness was hot to the touch and rather large, exceeding the deltoid muscle and going down into my bicep. I also felt radiating soreness into my armpit and left breast.  The following day the rash had grown in size and felt hot to the touch on my entire upper arm with swelling and edema that affected the movement of my arm and hand. Continued soreness and pain in my armpit, left breast and down my arm into my fingers and up into my neck.  I proceeded to go to the urgent care as directed by Clinic employee health and my PCP. There was I was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescriped Keflex for 7 days, 3x a day.  It has been recommended that I seek further medical care due to my reaction, but this has yet to be scheduled.

                                                I received the moderna covid vaccine at approx 0930 and waited in waiting room of facility per policy after injection.  I felt ok once wait time was up so I left.  I was driving approx 15 min later and (which was approx 30) after administration and pulled over to side of road due to getting chills and shaking and feeling faint.  Also, the left side of my face went numb and tingling.   I called for an ambulance and once they arrived I had started feeling normal again.  Facial tingling still persists at this time hours later.  I also had another sync opal episode once I got a ride home that resolved.  Left side of face feels like after being numb from a dentist.

                                                Immediately following shot, I had soreness in my arm that gradually worsened throughout the day. Around 8 pm the pain radiated up my shoulder across the top of my back. Around 10 pm I was suddenly hit with a wave of fatigue where my husband was unable to wake me from the couch to go to bed.  I woke up around 8:30 am on 1/7/21 with a debilitating headache, tingling in my fingertips,  and unsteadiness while walking. I was advised to go to the ED who gave no treatment other than recommending OTC pain meds, benedryl and rest. I returned home and took all the recommendations. At 4:41 pm, there has been no change with symptoms.

                                                After receiving the shot,  I experienced a sharp pain in my shoulder and neck on the left side (same side as the shot was received).  This only lasted a couple of minutes and then I felt normal.  That evening the area where I received the shot was sore and hard to lift.  This is when I started to notice stiffness in my left elbow joint and muscle aches throughout my body.  Upon waking the following morning,  the stiffness in my elbow joint had increase and it made it difficult to bend my elbow.  At this point,  I had assumed that maybe I had pulled something or slept on it wrong.  I figured it would work itself out in a day or two.  This has not been the case.  It is now day 8,  my elbow joint is stiff with soreness and pain in the surrounding area.  I am not able to lift items as I normally would or squeeze/hold items in my  left hand without experiencing pain in that elbow or the surround muscles.  It had been uncomfortable and painful to move and bend that arm and even the simple act of straightening the elbow is difficult to accomplish.  All pain and discomfort is limited to the elbow joint and surrounding area.

My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

Day 2 after the injection was mainly mild body ache and moderate arm pain at the injection site.

I never even felt it coming on, I just remember waking up. I looked at the clock at 4:46am. It seemed like a very long time to be out. When I woke up I felt very nauseas and had a hard time getting up to go to the bathroom. I never did get sick but laid down and fell asleep immediately. I slept all day Sunday. Today, Monday 1/11/21, I am still exhausted and light headed but not as nauseas.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after first covid vaccine I was nauseous, muscle cramps in whole right arm (the side I was given the shot), migraine, dizzy, trouble lifting arm, redness swelling and pain at injection site.  Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                Day of shot had pretty extreme pain in the arm a few hours later into the night. Was pretty extreme next day - couldn?t move arm above head, hard to change in and out of clothes, etc. Following day still pain but maybe 10%better. Over weekend slowly got better. This Monday and Tuesday woke up with very slight pain but nothing that I had to adjust my everyday routine for like a I had the first few days so I thought I was in the clear. Then last night extreme pain back again. Can?t move arm/shoulder without pain. Can?t engage muscle without a lot of pain.

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

She was alert and oriented but appeared to be weak and mildly uncomfortable.  She was observed for almost 30 minutes with resolution of the nausea but remained weak, dizzy and then started to c/o of facial numbness &#34;like I got novocaine.&#34;  She stated it was her whole face including lips and tongue.  She remained alert talking in full sentences.  &#43;facial symmetry, no obvious facial or tongue swelling.  Vitals remained stable.

Normal treatment that works for me( rizatroban) only slightly lessened. Advil Tylenol alternated for migraine and chills. Arm much less sore this time. I would say normal injection soreness.  But stayed in bed all day due to migraine, chills and fatigue. No way I could have worked. 36hrs- woke up feeling really foggy and some dizziness.  After drinking a few glasses of water feeling somewhat normal.  No fatigue today, arm feeling almost normal.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

At that time I was also experiencing a severe headache at the base of the back of neck, my neck was very stiff and one of my lymph nodes at the base of the front of my neck had swelled to the approximant size of a half dollar and raised up about 1 to 1 and 1/2. inches. The site where the swelling was located was very sensitive to the slightest touch, also on the same arm I received the injection. About 2 hours after waking, I started experiencing dizziness and nausea very suddenly to the point where I had to sit myself down in the hall way for a few minutes. I thought at one point I needed to call an ambulance as I made my way to lay down on my couch because I felt so sick. With in about 15 minutes after laying still on the couch the overwhelming need to vomit came over me. Which I did do for a good 5 minutes. There was quite a bit of relief from the nausea and dizziness shortly after but remained present the entire day. However the severe head ache continued until the morning of 1-27 and the lymph node still is slightly swollen with sensitivity to the touch.

My arm was very sore-felt hot and like someone punched me. Within 1 hour I had a headache (migraine) that continued from the onset until 6PM 1/6/2020. I felt unwell, malaise, and lightheaded, flu-like for this time period. I experienced muscle stiffness and soreness from the top of my head, down the left side of my neck, down my arm to the elbow on my left side. This continued for about 3 days.

                                                About 3 hours after the injection, I was hit all of a sudden with extreme fatigue and dizziness. This lasted several hours until a took a 2-3 hour nap after lunch. I felt better enough after the nap to at least get through the rest of the day. However, by around 8 pm I had uncontrollable shaking chills. Could not get warm. Eventually fell asleep, and woke up 3 hours later with fever and severe body aches. My temperature was 101.5, but consider that my normal body temp is a full degree lower than average, so for me this was extremely hot. I felt like my body was radiating heat like a furnace. I was so hot and uncomfortable that I couldn&#39;t sleep, and gave up after an hour. I got up and had a Tylenol, tea, and snack (so as to not have the Tylenol on empty stomach). A little before 4 am I finally fell asleep again. When I woke up around 7 am, I didn&#39;t feel quite so hot anymore but there were still the body aches. As the morning went on, the aches reduced to just my upper body, neck, and the sore injection arm. I had a headache through the morning and early afternoon, but by late afternoon I was feeling more normal again.

My fever peaked at 101.2 at 2am. Pain relievers and fever reducers did not help. I had cold sweats throughout the night, not able to sleep consistently through the night due to body aches, headache and nausea. Left arm became swollen, hot and hard to the touch, this lasted through 2/17/21. The arm was itchy from 2/18-2/20/21. The fever and body aches lasted through 2/16 until about 10:15pm, around 11:00pm the headache went away. I was feeling mostly recovered with the exception of the arm by the morning of 2/17.

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

I was unable to get out of bed for 24 hours.  After 24 hours of this, my headache lingered for 2 days as well as my neck stiffness and malaise.  I would likely not get a 2nd dose ever again because the symptoms were so awful.  I am a Registered Nurse.

                                                I was a little achy about 7 hours after I got my second vaccine. Later that evening, it hurt to raise the arm where I received the injection. The next day, about 24 hours after the vaccine, I had a fever of 100.1° and my arm was tight, red, and warm to the touch around the injection site. My fever broke by 29 hours after the injection, but my arm is still warm, tight, and red 50 hours after the vaccine.

I began driving to pick up my husband from work and approximately 5 minutes later, I began to feel woozy and unwell. I wanted to pull the car over, but I was stuck at a red light. The next thing I remember is two men opening the doors to my car and telling me  I had had a seizure. While I was unconscious the car had driven into a fire hydrant and water was shooting over the car and street. The men helped me from the car and I laid on the sidewalk until the ambulance arrived. I was transported to the hospital.

And the chest pain started as a severe shooting pain in my chest. The pain was constant,  After two days of chest pain I visited the Emergency room on 01/11/2021. I got IV fluids. EKG was not normal.  Discharged from hospital and referred to a cardiologist for follow up.  No Health Insurance so no follow up yet.  Chest pain still present but not constant. I never had chest pain before the vaccine. No second dose of vaccine yet.

                                                I did initially feel a little light headed while waiting the 15 minutes post vaccine, but thought I was anxious. As I was driving home at 3:50 pm I suddenly started to feel tingling in my lips and my throat felt swollen and my chest tight. I was halfway home and panicked so I went home and stayed put. My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

                                                On the 1/23  I started to have a rash at the area of the injection site. It was very uncomfortable. Very itchy and felt very hot.  I had to ice pack it and put calamine lotion to help with the symptoms. I did not take anything orally as I was not sure if it was safe to take anti histamines being that I am pregnant. The next day I went to work however I was still having a lot of itchiness in the area of injection.  I took a benadryl table at around 9 am.  At around 10 o&#39;clock I started feeling dizzy and not myself.  I felt that I could not think clearly and I was worried about passing out.  Specially due to my pregnancy ( 13 weeks at that time)  I decided to seek medical attention and went to urgent care.

                                                A couple hours after the shot I began to talk a lot.  I needed to talk so badly that the words began to be jumbled as I was speaking too fast.  I began texting and talking non-stop.  I was pacing the house and could not sit still.  My pupils did not dilate and my heart rate remained within normal limits. These effects kept me up late and kept me from getting tired.  I have Multiple Sclerosis, so this is unusual.  I finally was able to rest by self-medicating with marijuana at around 10pm that same night.  I still could feel the same effects the next day but much less severe.  This entire reaction was very strange and worrisome.  I realize that injection site soreness is common, but mine was especially severe.  This might be relevant considering the manic side effect that also occurred.  My left arm (at injection site) began to become sore around the same time that the manic effects started.  The pain was so intense that I could not use that arm at all.  It hurt to life the arm whatsoever and the pain radiated down my entire left side.  I even felt it in my left leg as I climbed the stairs.  This pain lessened over the course of the next four days until gone.

                                                Initially tasted metal, numb mouth, flushing, later resulting in all flu like symptoms (severe chilling, fever, body aches, headaches and GI issues.) GI issues persisted for the next 3 weeks and on Thursday evening, 2/25/2021 at about 6:30 pm. I was sitting on floor with children and almost passed out. I felt very faint, dizzy, and instantly started chilling. I had a fever of 102.8 and could not get warm. My husband was going to call paramedics, but I encouraged him not to. Discovered my right breast was red and inflamed/ swollen as well as all of my lymph nodes in my right arm pit. I could not reach my right arm forward. I noticed around 12:06 AM after not being able to get warm or break fever. I messaged my primary care clinic when I noticed the breast swelling, redness, pain, and lymph node swelling. I continually felt like I was going to faint/pass out and was very dizzy all night long. I was also extremely fatigued. The did a telemedicine appointment the next morning and diagnosed me with mastitis and prescribed me antibiotics. I am a breastfeeding mother and all of these symptoms came on suddenly and severely on the same side that I got the vaccine shot. I have been breastfeeding for over 7 months and my supply has been dwindling to nothing so I have no problems with engorgement or blocked milk ducts. Before this baby I had just got done breastfeeding a baby for 11 months with no issues of the like.

On day 9 I started to get dizzy at the grocery. Driving home I started to sweat and feel light headed. I was able to get to a friends and became very dizzy and nauseous. After an hour my throat started to swell and my chest tightened. I was taken to urgent care where I received epinephrine and solumedrol. My injection site is no longer read and I?m on oral steroids now.

Arm still sore and swollen. Feels like a mild common cold. 48 - 60 hours everything seems to have cleared up. Still slightly swollen lymph and tenderness/ swelling/ lump at injection site.

                                                Dizziness started around 230pm in the afternoon on Saturday, 3 days after the first does (i also felt a brief wave, Friday around the same time,  2:30pm only 2 days after my shot). Sunday morning when I woke up I felt full on vertigo (forward and back) and a disoriented feeling due to feeling a really strong pulse consistently in my head and whole body. This dizziness and vertigo caused naseua. I treated it with meclizine and ondansetron but it only mildly helped symptoms. I went to urgent care and got a steroid shot. They also measured that my blood pressure was high. The steroid shot also did not do much to change the dizziness. Today is Wednesday, a full week after my first shot, and I am still feeling dizzy, with pulsing pressure in my head and full body causing vertigo. I went to an ent today and was started on a z pack. I&#39;m not sure what else to try or how long to expect this or if this is considered an allergic reaction and I should skip my second dose?

                                                Arm sore within 15 minutes of injection. Stayed mildly sore for 1-2 days.  Within 7 hours, severe muscle cramps, particularly in the lower extremities. Causing me to writhe in pain.  Tense right sided neck and jaw pain. Severe occipital headache (felt like hit with a baseball bat). Trembling. No fever. Symptoms improved around hour 12 post vaccine. For 7 days following the vaccine, intermittent severe headache (again occipital, baseball bat feeling), whole body weakness, sense that legs would give out when walking (I am physically active and fit so this was very far from my baseline), muscles would burn and fatigue after short period of usage, sensation that legs from the knees down were sitting in ice water (felt cold, slightly numb, very weak). Symptoms were present for 7 days and would wax and wane in intensity.

I made an appointment with my primary care physician who recommended i follow up with a neurologist. I scheduled a neurologist appointment for a month later but went to the ER three times with symptoms worsening feeling weak and like I was going to pass out. I was initially told by my primary care physician and ER physician that this was not a side effect of the vaccine so i received my second dose. My heartrates have not been able to be controlled since going up to the 190&#39;s when i stand.

                                                Within minutes of injection developed sore arm. Next day I had an extreme headache, dizziness, lethargy.  About four or five days later I developed a pain in my left armpit and wasn?t sure if it was my lymph nodes or a scapular muscle. I woke up a weeke later with a large swollen rash at the injection site, about 2? in diameter.

                                                Effects of vaccine were all normal during the first few days and through the first week.  Had a bit of heart palpitations and fever after dose #2 - but it subsided by day 2 and i was back to normal mostly, no real issues.  A week later i experienced an episode of almost-syncope in which i start falling forward in my seat and almost hit the wall in front of me and couldn&#39;t hold my head up.  This has NEVER happened to me before.  I did have a panic attack AFTER this because of how scared i had become of that feeling, but i recognize that and know the difference.  After that i continued to experience bouts of dizziness and disequilibrium.  I have almost fallen reaching for things, opening my car door, walking, etc.  Several weeks later i experienced another flare up of the syncope feeling while at work where i almost fainted again and was able to regain composure and the disequilibrium sensation lasted for several days to which i sought medical help.  I have been visiting a chiropractor and a physical therapist for over a month now with minor improvement.  I still experience unexplained episodes that prevent me from being able to work properly or leave my home as it would be unsafe to drive or be out in case i need medical assistance.  I have never experienced ANYTHING like this until i was vaccinated and three months later it is still affecting my quality of life.

                                                I received the vaccine at work Thursday {December 31st} morning, and started feeling sick that same evening. Including malaise, low grade fever..not higher than 99.6, mild sore throat, shortness of breath, dehydration/dry mouth, light-headedness/dizziness, runny nose, and coughing. These symptoms continued on and off from {12/31-and continued all throughout the weekend and continue as of today-01/04}. Fevers don&#39;t last long, they come and go. The main symptoms that are chronic and consistent are the runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath, and feeling tired/lethargic, just low energy.

                                                I woke up the morning following my first dose of the COVID 19 vaccine feeling very lethargic, tremulous and achy. I felt like my heart rate has been rapid all day and my rate of breathing has been slightly increased. The pain in my left arm, where I was given the injection is very sore to the point where it is difficult to lift or to touch. I was too weak to attempt to go to follow up with medical professionals today and opted to wait to see if symptoms resolved.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

I sat to wait and within five minutes was lightheaded, overheated but having chills and having intense abdominal cramps. My pulse ox and bpm were fine but my blood pressure was low for me; normal is 110/70 and emt&#39;s confirmed that I was 90/60 and then 98/62 after 40 minutes post vaccine.  I waited longer and then not feeling worse left. Advil fixed the cramps. So far it&#39;s only been pain at the injection site.

                                                Approximately around 8:00 pm the same day as my injection I started to be in a fair amount of pain at the injection site (right shoulder) I took a bath still was in pain took Tylenol hoping it would take the edge off around 11:30 the pain started to increase so I put a heating pad on my arm . As the night progressed my shoulder pain intensified and then  I started to feel pain all over my by body mainly in the joints. It was very severe joint pain all over and especially in my right shoulder that I took another bath.  I couldn?t lay down or sleep I could barely walk around my bedroom but even that hurt so bad in my hips and knees. This feeling was very similar as if I were to having an lupus episode in my joints. Around 4 am on January 14th I finally took ibuprofen and eventually I was able to fall asleep. I later woke up around 9 am and thankfully pain free other than a mild shoulder pain where I got my vaccine.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                Since receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020 I have been experiencing what almost feels like brain fog. I have had some trouble staying on task at work, trouble finding words, remembering common last names, etc. Oftentimes I will have this temporarily as a migraine aura, but it typically goes away once the migraine comes and goes. This seems to have come to stay since receiving the vaccine. I did have fatigue for approximately 3 days after the vaccine administration - 2-3 hour naps daily. This has improved some. I also had a dull headache that seemed to be there daily for approximately 2.5 weeks post vaccine- nothing I could not tolerate but it just did not want to go away even with my usual treatment - Excedrin Headache and ice.  The best way I can describe it is a dull pain all over the top of my head and forehead. I did have one headache that occurred approximately 5 days after the vaccine, that I would consider a &#34;bad migraine&#34; (Migraine that rendered me incapable of completing my daily routine - having to stay in bed, dizziness, etc). My face on the side with the weakness as a result of my brain tumor has also been a bit more &#34;tired&#34; than usual - facial palsy more pronounced. There have been times in my brain tumor journey where this happens for sometimes a couple of weeks at a time usually due to stress or an impending &#34;bad migraine&#34; coming on or if I have been exposed to or end up developing an illness later - but I never developed an illness an no additional stress. Facial symptoms include smile not as symmetrical (basically more assymetrical than usual - not wanting to move at all so much on the affected side) and more eye watering on the affected side. I do still feel a little lightheaded at times, but otherwise no other neurological symptoms. No upper respiratory symptoms or any other &#34;COVID-like&#34; symptoms. No nausea, vomiting, numbness, or tingling. Symptoms do seem to be improving this week.

When I got out of bed, and went to the bathroom, everything went white and I fell. I was able to get up on my own but had to lay back down. I thought I would be unable to go to work but after resting for about 15 minutes, I was able to get up, finish getting ready for work but continued to get lightheaded if I stood in one spot for too long. I was very tired and out of it the rest of the day, and having chills throughout the day. All of this in addition to my arm being very sore and my back hurt from my fall. I also had a very bad headache, and later in the day, around 430pm, my temp was 100.2.  I took tylenol and went to bed around 630.

                                                Full anaphylactic shock; Hives; Low blood pressure; Dizziness; Stuffy nose; Bad headache; Nausea; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare facility staff member who was a 36-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, and who developed full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose.  The patient&#39;s medical history included a latex allergy and pregnancy.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06-Jan-2021, approximately 30 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT 01122019) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient received her Moderna vaccine on 06 Jan 2021 at noon.  She reported that approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she went into full anaphylactic shock.  She stated that the reaction began with nausea.  She then developed hives, got low blood pressure, and was dizzy.  She was taken to the hospital.  There, she received two rounds of epinephrine along with diphenhydramine and famotidine.  She was released that same day from the hospital once she stabilized.   On 07-Jan-2021, a full 24 hours after receiving her vaccine, she experienced another anaphylactic reaction.  She stated that the reaction happened exactly like it did on 06 Jan 2021 and presented with all the same symptoms.  Patient injected herself with the epinephrine pen that she had at home as soon as the symptoms started.     In addition to the anaphylactic reactions she experienced, patient reported that she had a bad headache since receiving the vaccine as well as a stuffy nose that comes and goes and coincides with hives.  As of 10 Jan 2021, she stated that the flare ups had finally subsided, however, she continued taking diphenhydramine and famotidine as prophylaxis for anaphylactic reaction.   Treatment for the event included epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events, full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose, was not provided.   The events, full anaphylactic shock and low blood pressure were considered resolved on 07 Jan 2021. The events, nausea, hives, and dizziness were considered recovered/resolved on 10 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the events, bad headache and stuffy nose, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 36-year-old female patient with medical history of latex allergy, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 01122019), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock, the non-serious listed events of Headache and Nausea, and the non-serious unlisted events of Urticaria, Hypotension, Dizziness, and Nasal congestion.  Based on the current available information and temporal associon between the use of the product and the onset of events starting on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

                                                Small red area developed 2 days after injection on my arm at the injection site. On day 5, I woke up with a sore throat. On days 6-9 I continued with a sore throat and developed runny nose and congestion. On day 6 after the injection I had a rapid covid test (non pcr) that came back negative. 9 days after the injection the red area on my arm at the injection site grew in size and continued to spread around my arm over the next 3-4 days. Spot was bright red and hot and itchy at times. Spot was tender if poked but otherwise not painful. On day 10 after the injection I woke up with a dizzy spell that lasted approx one hour. I was prescribed antibiotics on day 12 after the injection for concern of cellulitis. I never had fevers but I did have an episode of chills the night of  day 12 after one dose of keflex.  As I took the antibiotic, the spot decreased in redness and size within 48 hours. I took 500mg keflex two times a day for 7 days. I finished the antibiotic last night. The area is not as red, but looks more like a faded bruise. I read a story about ?covid arm? from USA today this morning about similar reactions and wanted to report my experience. I am a social worker in a primary care office that has been working remotely up until this point.

Small, splotchy redness occurred around the injection site 24 hours later but disappeared the next day.     On 1/31/2021 (8 days post vaccine) redness/itchiness/swelling occurred near the injection site (immediately below) and grew in size to approx 3 inches long and 2 inches wide, became warm and raised by the evening of 1/31/2021 and remains this way today 2/1/2021.   Appears like cellulitis but no other symptoms and does not appear to be growing in size as of now.

The above symptoms subsided some approximately 24 hours post vaccine and were resolved by approximately 40 hours post vaccine. However, 1 p.m. on 1/22, noticed injection site was itchy, red, swollen, and sore. Took Benadryl that evening and swelling subsided some by next morning and completely resolved by 1/25.

By 3 am was up again vomiting. That lasted a few hours. Temp hovered around 101-102 all day (alternating Tylenol 1000mg and Motrin 600 mg q 3 -4 hours). Could not get out of bed all day.  It was pretty intense. By evening the N/V subsided but the other symptoms remained. Temp broke by 10 pm.  The next morning temp was normal, chills were gone, still had the migraine (which migraines are not unusual).  Felt fatigue and body aches, but was functional.

The next day I was standing at my standing desk and started to feel light headed, and sat down and became ore light headed. My vison started to gray out,  my arms were tingling and my ears were ringing.  That lasted for a few minutes, it slowly got worse to the point where I thought I was going to faint, then slowly got better.  I spoke to my midwife about this, I was unsure if it was the vaccine or the pregnancy.  I&#39;ve never had this happen before. My midwife thought it was a Blood drop from eating then standing up right away.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

She states she has had vasovagal reactions in the past after giving blood and that she did not eat much today, so low blood sugar may be involved.  Pharmacist took patient&#39;s blood pressure and pulse, which were both normal, and observed patient seated for 30 minutes.  Patient applied ice pack to forehead and neck and drank some juice her mother bought and started to feel better.  She was able to walk out on her own after sitting and never actually passed out.

By 8am, the fatigue set in and my headache got progressively worse. By 11am, I the nausea set in. I almost vomited multiple times. By 12pm, my headache was now a migraine. I was very fatigued, nausea, and had bad chills. I felt like I was freezing! The chills subsided within a couple hours and never returned. I had nausea on and off for 2 days and a nonstop headache for about 4-5 days. My arms was extremely sore and I didn?t start to feel any real relief for about 3 days. The soreness lasted about 5 days. On day 5, I noticed a large, grapefruit size, rash appear around the injection site

I went back to work on the 7th - it was rough but over the weekend I started doing better and the following week was better for me.

                                                On 2/4/21,  after receiving the vaccine I was starting to feel a slight headache but more like pressure. I was also feeling a bit nauseous but I thought it was stress but I did took an ibuprofen.  Later I starter to feel very tired do I went to sleep like about 7pm and I took a Tylenol before doing so.   I kept on waking up in the middle of the night still feeling pressure pain in my head and like a tightness sensation with a slight pain on my chest.   I woke up at 5am to get ready to work and I was still not feeling well. I got out of the house and stoped at a gas station and when I got out of the car, I started to feel extremely dizzy while walking. Got to my work place and took my temperature and it was 99.1. After a while dizziness and pressure on chest kept on getting worst.   I had someone at work take my vitals and my temperature was 101.0,  BP was 144/95, BPM was 120,  SpO2 was 98%. My boss send me home. And now I?m having mid and back lower pain with a bit of chills

I recovered very quickly, the illness lasted about 24 hours. Five days later (1/28) the same exact thing happened only worse, I experienced all symptoms listed above in addition to vomiting and extreme dizziness.  Again, my symptoms subsided pretty quickly but then 24 hours later I became achy, fatigued and developed a minor cough with shortness of breath.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the 2nd shot of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine around 9:25 am on 2/5/2021, after about 10 minutes I became hot and lightheaded.  Immediately after that I started getting tingling and numbness bilaterally in my hands and fingers with a heavy sensation.  My heart also started racing.  The nurses put me in a wheelchair and escorted me upstairs to the ER.  In transit my face and throat/neck started getting tingling as well.  By the time we reached the ER waiting room (9:42 am) I got the shakes/chills and was very cold.  I continued having the shakes for several minutes.  By the time I was brought back into the triage area (9:50 am) my legs from the shin to feet bilaterally started going numb/tingly as well.  I started having a cyclical reaction.  I would shake/have the chills for about 5 minutes (without any tingling/numbness in extremities), after that I would get a full body flushing sensation with feeling of lightheadedness and nausea, followed by numbness/tingling in both hands and feet. Then the cycle would repeat itself for several hours.  I continued to have a heavy sensation of my hands and feet until about 10:15 am.  After that the heaviness sensation did not accompany the tingling/numbness that persisted.  I was hooked up to IV fluids and IV benadryl at 10:45 am.  By 12:30 I finally stopped getting the chills/shaking sensation but I had a consistent body flushing followed by tingling/numbness in my hands and feet (mostly hands/arms) about every 5 minutes.  Around 1 pm I all symptoms had stopped.  The doctor said all my tests and blood work looked good.   I was discharged from the hospital around 2:45 pm with instrustions to followup with primary doc or return to the ER if symptoms got worse.   At 5:30 pm that evening all my symptoms came back, started with chills and then full body flushing sensation followed by tingling/numbness in both arms/hands bilaterally. I also had a hot sensation up the entire side of my left arm (injection site arm) up to my ear.     I took 2 500 mg tablets of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl at 6:20.  By 6:40 I was starting to feel a little better with less shaking and less body flushing/tingling.  Symptoms seemed gone by 7 pm.  I went to bed at 9 pm and woke up around 10:30 pm to my body flushing and my hands going tingling/numb.  I tried to sleep, but could not.  Around 11:30 pm I took 1 500 mg tablet of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl.  I woke up the next morning (2/6/2021) with no numbness/tingling shaking or body flushing.  I felt extremely exhausted and sore.  That day my symptoms did not return.   I woke up on Sunday 2/7/2021 with no symptoms, but around 8:30 am I had a lightheaded episode and hot sensation with a feeling of nausea.  I then started to get tingling in my face, mouth and lips.  It persisted for 2.5 hours until I decided to take Benadryl (2 25 mg tablets).  about 30 minutes after taking medication the tingling stopped.  It did not return.

                                                3 hours post vaccine, extreme arm pain. Couldn?t lift my arm to get my sweater off. By 10pm I had extreme chills (shaking so hard my jaw locked from being so tense). Sharp shooting pain in my right leg started (still sore today). I then had extreme muscle aches, I could hardly walk to the bathroom. Finally at 12:15 am I took Tylenol.  Was able to sleep until 4 am and woke up with all the same symptoms... still extreme. Kidney pain started around 6am.  I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep until 10am. Woke up feeling just as bad- couldn?t eat. Went back to sleep. Woke up at noon with a headache on top of the rest and had to take ibuprofen (I didn?t want to exceed the allowed amount of acetaminophen in 24 hrs). Kidney pain continued, muscle aches as well. Chills went away around 4pm.  Woke up today feeling pretty good except the headache and kidney pain. Headache subsided around noon. Noticed a giant, raised, hot spot about an inch below vaccine sore tonight... assuming it?s ?Covid arm? . Super strange! Thankful for the vaccine, but dang- I?ve never had any kind of reaction from any vaccine, ever. I get my flu shot yearly.

                                                On the following day after receiving my first dose of the vaccination, my arm was throbbing, completely swollen, decreased ROM and skin was RED and severely tender to the touch. Took OTC Tylenol (2) po and had no signs of relief. Pain , swelling, and skin redness lasted for 3 days. On February 10th, 2021 I had a positive pregnancy test (confirmed by bloodwork and urine) which indicated I was 6-7 weeks pregnant and had a miscarriage on March 2021, after giving live births 3 prior times. The cause of the miscarriage is unknown.  I also developed a blood clot on the arm that was inserted for an IV. I have no family history or personal history of needing blood thinners.

Back left under ribs back pain...then chest pain left / same spot on the front left... felt like a cardiac event. Then I saw the large inflamed rash on my left arm and I collapsed in the shower. I took my medicine and went to sleep and felt ok for a little this morning and now the pain is back - this time with heartburn. I?ve been sick to my stomach on and off since the vaccine, weird taste and feeling in the back of my throat, place where they gave me the shot swelled up half the size of a baseball within an hour of the vax - it?s still a bit bigger than my other side. Could it be allergic reaction to this?

                                                I recieved my second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 3/6/21 at 3pm and by 9am on 3/7/21 I had a fever of 101.6 and it would spike up to 102.6 going up and down over the next 2 days. I experienced a high fever that only decreased to a low fever of 100.5 with ibuprofen and cool baths and cold fluids for two days. The injection site was swollen and painful for 3 days just like the first vaccine, but the fever and full body aches accompanied by once of the worst light sensitive headache I have ever experienced lasted for 2 days. The 3rd day was interesting, my fever broke and my lower back now ached very bad and I was weak to stand. The most interesting thing that happened on the third day was a full badly rash that looked and felt like a full body sunburn. My fever had broken, but my skin was bright red and radiated heat of 101.5, but my head temp read normal 98.6 The red sunburn skin cut off dramatically at my wrists. I took pictures because it was so bizarre looking. By Wednesday morning the rash/sunburn was almost 70% gone and I was starting to feel like a normal human being again.  I would like to note that I had a very mild fever 99.9 with my first vaccine shot and my arm was very sore and swollen for 3 days. I did also have a mild fever rash on my belly, back &amp; forearms I would also like to say this was the sickest I have been in over 5&#43; years ( my second dose) it was no joke! Thank god for my husband taking care of me, I don?t know what I would have done if I was alone.

A little over a day later, my right arm, the opposite arm of the injection, started to twitch.  it twitches on the upper forearm and lower bicep.  This has been going on since the day after.  About three days after, above my left knee started to twitch as well.  I did not have any impacts or anything out of the ordinary that would cause this outside of the vaccine.

I also began getting lightheaded the day after the vaccine. I started noticing it roughly 24 hours after the vaccine. I had Covid previously and it was the same feeling of being lightheaded that I had while I had Covid-19. I&#39;m still getting lightheaded two days after the vaccine, but it&#39;s not as bad.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

Later that night I started to have a headache and the next morning I felt so tired and groggy it was hard to get up. I continued to feel exhausted and have difficulty focusing due to the headache and tiredness the entire day. I woke up feeling better the next morning.

                                                While waiting the 15 minutes after the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy, I thought it was just because I was nervous.  After the 15 minutes, I went outside and tood off my mask to get some fresh air.  I went back to work and was still feeling dizzy.  I drank water, ate some food and sat for a bit.  At about 1pm, I was still feeling dizzy but also started feeling off, as if I were intoxicated or like how you feel when you just wake up from having anesthesia, sluggish.  I then went home and slept for about 5 hours and now I feel much better.  Will someone let me know if it is recommended I still get the second dose next month?

The pain has become so severe that I cannot use my left arm.  The pain is intolerable.  I take four Advil every six hours, ice my arm regularly, and keep my arm in a sling.  The pain has gotten significantly worse with time (not better).  I?ve never experienced pain like this from a vaccine in my life.  No history of bursitis or shoulder injury.  Again, the pain gets worse with time.  I?m almost 48 hours post injection

                                                Starting within the hour of my shot my left arm was very stiff and throbbing in pain. By 5pm I could not wiggle my fingers or even the slightest movement in my arm. At 7pm I started with a headache, complete body shakes, and a fever of 100. In the night it spiked to 102.6 All day Friday my fever stayed at 101-102.8. I had a bad headache and could not get any relief in my arm. My body ached and still had shakes from time to time. I took ibuprofen a couple of times to help with the pain and fever. By Saturday around 10am I had zero symptoms. Since then I have felt great.

She then also mentioned that her throat was sore and that had been occurring for about 15 minutes but she was trying to wait and see. Asked if she should just take benadryl. Advised that I could not advise that and would recommend seeing a physician. Walked her to the emergency department at 14:01.

All symptoms resolved in about 15 minutes with the exception of  numbness/tingling to tongue and lips which lasted 3 hours. Symptoms resolved on their own without treatment/medication other than lying flat with feet up and drinking a bottle of water. I was assessed by medical professionals at the vaccine clinic which was located inside of the hospital. I consulted with an ED physician but did not require any additional treatment.

This only lasted a few minutes, but later in the morning around 9am, body aches, fever, chills, fatigue began and lasted until 10pm. After this time, all symptoms ceased. I also had an extremely sore deltoid where injection site occurred for 48hrs, much worse than I&#39;ve ever had for any vaccine or IM injection.

I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

Tues Jan 12 midday while at work began experiencing increased post nasal drip and stiffness in my left lateral neck extending up towards basilar skull. Started taking Claritin after shift to help with congestion.  Thur Jan 14 Congestion is manageable with Claritin. Stiff neck is worse upon waking up around 8am and has spread to right side; left side remains most painful. Range of motion turning head leftward is limited and painful; turning head rightward is uncomfortable but range of motion not limited.  Sat Jan 16 Congestion is manageable with Claritin. Neck stiffness decreased somewhat throughout the workday and feels more sore than painful. Noted discomfort at left deltoid late into shift around 10pm. Noted mild redness and edema over left lateral deltoid where vaccine was administered approximately 7cm wide and 9cm long. Area feels more firm to touch and feels tight when moving left arm.

                                                when moving my left shoulder in a downward motion there is a tight pulling sensation that radiates from the base of my neck to my head.  It feels similar to a muscle strain.  I have not been performing any activities beyond my normal baseline and have not been lifting weights of any kind.

Took tylenol in the evening to help get sleep, woke up in the middle of the night with bad chills/then feeling very warm. More tylenol. Woke up in the morning and felt better, arm is still a little sore but I can move it a lot more, feels like a very bad bruise at this point.

The next day, she had left rib pain that lasted for 3 days. Then she experienced increased congestion, a funny taste, and chills.  The right side of her throat swelled. Fatigue was experienced during the entire ordeal. Approximately 1 week after the injection, she began to experience left deltoid weakness that limited the mobility of her shoulder.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the injection, I developed a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt a bit light-headed and woozy. I informed the staff at the site that I felt this way and they asked me to remain for additional monitoring. Over the next 15 minutes, my tongue began to swell. 15 minutes later my jaw began to stiffen and I had difficulty swallowing. After another 15 minutes the staff asked the EMS personnel to screen me and check my vitals. All were normal. After another 30 minutes of monitoring by EMS the symptoms began to subside and I went home.   At home, I began to feel weak and went to bed. My body began to ache and I took ibuprofen to ease the pain. Within 15 hours of receiving the dose, I had a 100.9-degree fever and chills. The fever lasted the next day. I could not get out of bed for the next day. When I tried to sit up and watch TV I had back pain so severe it left me in tears.  I went back to bed and stayed there until the following morning. All told, I could not get out of bed for 36 hours.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

                                                Two hours after the injection I experienced increasing soreness in my left shoulder up through the left side of my neck and down through the forearm. I became slightly nauseous through that evening. The pain and tightness got to the point I could not perform regular functions with the left arm. It felt as if my muscles were tearing and prevented me from sleeping. I took ibuprofen in addition to alternating ice and heat to no avail. It hurt to lift my arm, grip to pull or push even a blanket. This continued for 48 hours before there was slight relief. Full range of motion returned four days after the injection. For brief periods throughout the days following, I also experienced occasional slight heart palpitations.

I started feeling dizzy, a buzzing in my ears and broke into a sweat. I tried to stand up and walk over to my bed, but lost my balance and collapsed for about 5 seconds. Once I regained consciousness I stopped sweating, rested for a bit and then was able to resume normal function (drinking water, coffee, something sugary).

Went ER at 12:55 pm and they did an EKG - not a regular heartbeat; blood work and x-ray. My BP was high - 143/122; I had low potassium; white blood cells higher than normal -10.9 (in mid Nov - only 7.5); They gave me potassium to take. December 30, when I got home at 6:30 - nausea started and I was throwing up two-three  days in a row more than 5 or 6 times a day; weird metallic taste; fever at night; arm pain and swollen under my armpits. (Stayed off work three days.) Went to dr on Jan. 7 - did a follow up appt. and did all the blood work again and everything was back to normal.

I concurrently experienced a low-grade fever and tachycardia. In addition, I had severe pain at the injection in my right deltoid that significantly limited my ability to lift my arm. The pain extended all the way from my shoulder through my right wrist. Most symptoms, except for fatigue and pain limited to the injection site, resolved after 24 hours.

Nausea, thirst, headache, chills, body aches, 102° fever, exhaustion, and not being able to move arm where shot was. Also experiencing ear issues again which took almost 3 months to dissipate when I actually had covid. Shot was administered around 1700 on a Wednesday. Felt fine going to bed. Woke up to the headache that quickly progressed to everything else.

                                                Around 7 pm on Feb 22 I started feeling very fatigued and I had some body aches. I decided to go to bed early to try to sleep it off. About 5 am on Feb 23 I was woken up by a splitting headache. I also felt feverish and had the chills. My head hurt so bad, worse than any migraine I had ever had. I got out of bed to take some ibuprofen and could hardly even walk my body hurt so bad. I took the ibuprofen and went back to bed until about 8 am. When I woke up at 8 I felt okay other than a slight headache that lasted until about 7 pm when I took another dose of ibuprofen.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA I received the Covid 19 vaccine on December 22nd. On December 23rd in the evening I noticed that my injection site was warm to the touch, slightly erythematous and indurated. I was running a low grade fever of 99.9 that night. Start to get body aches, fatigue, headache, congestion and sore throat. The fatigue, body ache, congestion, sore throat and headache progressed/got worse into the 24th and 25th. By the 26th the symptoms had went away. The evening of December 29th, I noticed an intense itching in my left deltoid (which was my injection site). When I went to itch the area I could feel how hard the area was through my clothing. I looked at the area and it was indurated, erythematous and warm to the touch. It was approximately 5x3cm area. The itching continue to intensify going down my arm and up my neck. Over the next several days, I started to develop congestion, sore throat, body aches, fatigue, joint pain, headaches and the symptoms intensified. Friday January 8th, I was in severe pain and unable to walk that well. I went to rheumatology where I was given both oral and IM steroid to try to calm down the reaction and was told that was thrown into a full blown lupus flare. Restarted on methotrexate. Friday and Saturday improved slightly. Monday was difficulty to was due to pain and fatigue, not able to walk that well. Tues/Wednesday. Pain and fatigue manageable but noticeably above baseline and can definitely tell flare is no where under control. Thursday woke up at 5 am could not sleep due to pain. Pain intensified throughout the day and was un able to walk by 5pm due to severe joint pain. Rheumatologist and allergist confirmed that I am unable to get second dose of Covid vaccine. This maybe too much information but I figure you could used what you needed.

After first dose, I had a lard red, indurated but painless bump on my arm for a week. I became pregnant about two weeks after first dose and this, the second dose, was given at four weeks pregnant (due date oct 1 2021). Side effects included fever, chills, muscle aches, very sore arm, light-headedness, tachcardia.

Large oblong welt about 2 inches across at injection site. Symptoms started within a few hours of getting the injection and became steadily very significant by the next day. It took about 7 days to recover from the most significant symptoms and was still recovering from mild bruise and occasional itching but no redness. Today (1/26/2021) my arm started itching again, and I see that I have a large flat circular (about 2 inches across) red spot right where I had the welt a week ago.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

                                                After 2 hours after getting vaccine on my left arm. It started to get more sore then usually after getting a shot on your arm.  I started to think maybe the nurse gave me a shot to close to my shoulder bone. But that was not the case. By the following hours I could bearly move my left arm. I could not raise my arm above my chest with out sharp pain on left shoulder.. I left work early to work from home and it was hard to drive with the pain. By 7:00pm 1/27/2021 The pain was unbearable I had to take 2 ibuprofen 800 mg and a muscle relaxer.  I could not sleep all night the next day I called out from work. I woke up with still sharp arm pain and muscle soreness all over my body, tight muscles on both back shoulders and my back.  felt body aches.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills and body aches. I then went to bed. I was awoke shaking from being in such significant chills my body hurt all over through the bones something I have an experienced in a long time. I continue to try to sleep and rest the best I could but I stood up in the morning I felt tunnel vision and thought I was going to pass out I laid on the ground at a safety and collected myself over the course of five minutes. When I stood up I am mediately thought I was going to vomit Splash cold water on my face I force myself to eat and drink and take Tylenol and symptoms lessened but remained over the entire course of the following day another 24 hours. I?m about to go to bed and I will not know how I feel in the morning but this is definitely something I did not expect. My entire doctors office received vaccination on the same day out of a group of 15 people two of us had severe reaction similar to what I described and the other female that felt sick like me had worse symptoms and high fevers with the stores as well she has remained out of work as a result of her symptoms. We are both nurse practitioners so it?s not easy to cancel our schedule. I ended up tapping out today despite my leftover post vaccine side effects.

No fever.  Took Excedrin migraine and ibuprofen (no tylenol alone on hand). Suddenly had hot followed by cold flash and severe nausea. Then neurological panic attack (i have had this ONCE before approx. 10 years ago during a severe Migraine that was treated at ER). The anxiety attack did not affect breathing, but instead nausea and all over flashes of heat followed by BOTH arms from elbow to pinky and ring finger (ONLY) going numb. Called my primary care office and spoke to on call dr. While on phone with Dr. numbness and nausea resolved - less than 10 mins total. Agreed that was anxiety attack and all symptoms were within expected for vaccination. Returned to be to try and sleep.  Wednesday - 8 am to 10pm - severe body aches, slight elevated temp. 99.8, headache, and around 5pm started experiencing vertigo. Took maximum daily ibuprofen for body aches  and had some relief. No work or any productive activities were able to be completed.   Thursday (1/28): woke up less fatigued and less body aches. significant vertigo is still present. Headache is still present. No fever. Left arm pit still sore - no swollen lymph nodes that I can feel.

                                                The HCW noted w/i 1 hr of vaccination a constellation of symptoms including dizziness, disorientation, and fatigue; and by 4 hrs she developed swelling LUE with pain and some swelling extending to the L neck.  Over the next several days she reported marked swelling and tenderness over the triceps upper arm area; persistent swelling and pain in the neck that required cold packs for a couple days.  The reaction appeared to be more pronounced and extensive akin to the Humira local reaction she would ordinarily get; the last dose of that was 4 months prior.  By history, it sounds like extensive angioedema.  At no point was there any pruritus, erythema, or hive or rash on any other part of the body; no respiratory compromise, stridor or wheeze; and no fever.  Symptoms subsided over several days and she was well on day of her presenting for her second vaccination.  The vaccinator (who is a pediatrician), an on-call allergist; and this reporter (a medical oncologist) all consulted on best approach.  The allergist recommends skin testing; Humira may have a polysorbate component; and we collectively thought a contraindication to proceeding.  Given the deliberation the HCW actually elected also not to proceed.  We informed her that early data suggests one dose of the Moderna vaccine may confer an approximate 80% protection.  She will present to EHS for further evaluation.

                                                Two hours after the injection my arm became very sore. About ten hours after my injection my body began to ache and my throat was sore. I slept for one hour and woke up with intense chills, muscle aches, and pins and needles all throughout my body. I developed a headache and became short of breath an hour later, and was unable to walk more than a few feet without becoming extremely fatigued. 15 hours later I&#39;m still experiencing the same symptoms.

                                                I woke up in extreme pain in my right shoulder. I couldn&#39;t lift my arm without the help of my other arm.  Raising it and lowering were extremely painful.  I couldn&#39;t raise it above my waist. This lasted for about 8 hours. I took 800 mg Ibuprofen and I could finally move my arm to chest level but it still ached, even when just laying at my side so I had to hold it to my chest. After 4 days, it felt better but there was still pain when raising my arm over my head. It felt like I had ripped something in my shoulder at the rotator cuff. 4 days later, the pain came back and I had to once again hold my arm at chest level for 2 days. Yesterday, January 28th, I went to my doctor and received a steroid injection in my shoulder and they also put in MRI orders.

                                                At approx 40 minutes after vaccine noticed numbness /pins&amp; needles through left side of body which spanned from face to foot. Interior of mouth and behind/inside ear were numb and unable to move. When smiling left side of mouth could not lift up despite attempting to move muscles. Additionally, saliva was increased... or I just couldn?t properly control it.  Interior muscles in mouth remain loose. Lasted 3 days but gradually got better each day

                                                5 min post injection, shoulder pain. 23 hours post injection Fatigue, dizziness, lightheaded, shortness of breath, low blood pressure (85/53). Symptoms lasted 6 days post injection diminishing on day 5 to include only moderate fatigue. On day 7 post injection, the first phyical activity (skiing) immediatly resulted in heart pain (angina) and inability to take a deep breath. Assessment at the ER for a heart attack showed higher than normal range of troponin (.031)but a clear x-ray and EKG. Tests were repeated 4 hours after initial tests and troponin was within normal limits (.020). I was discharged with a 2/100 risk of heart attack in the next 30 days and a follow up stress test. I believe this was a direct result of the Covid-19 Maderna shot. I believe is reduced my hearts ability to work at a normal capacity and respond to physical activity.

                                                Friday early morning woke up with a 101.1 fever. Took ibuprofen for it also had headache and nauseous. Every muscle bone and joint just hurt. Throughout thr day fever just kept getting higher, up to 103. Along with by 4 pm walking felt like a chore and the pain was so bad could barely walk without crying. Kept on taking ibuprofen. By Saturday morning fever finally broke woke up sweating at 3 am then again at 9 am. Now just feeling really exhausted, headache and a little sore. A lot better.

                                                Arm started to be painful about 2 hours after injection. By evening I could barely move my arm. Around 10pm pain was so bad I was crying.  Could not lift arm. Could still move my hand. Woke up multiple times in pain.  By morning arm pain had decreased but felt lethargic and weak. By noon I had taken a nap. My 15 year old daughter said she came to check on me and I woke up but my eyes were rolling on the back of my head. I slept for over 3 hours. Woke up sweating  achy. Still felt tired and lethargic. Arm was still sore but was able to move it around. Went to bed again around midnight- woke up today (Thursday) and felt much better.

I have had vasovagal events in the past and this was exactly like them, only normally they are triggered by an event, and there was no event so I assume it was the vaccine. After sleeping it off under multiple blankets for a couple hours I seem to be recovered and just have a headache.

Walking my heart rate went up to 154 BPM. I called my PCP and rested as prescribed. My heart rate stayed at 120 BPM. I did have the same reaction to Dose 2 which we treated the same way.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 2/12/2021 around 2:30pm.  I experienced some arm pain later that evening as expected.  Around 2am on 2/13/2021, I was awakened by body pain and nausea.  I woke up in a pool of sweat.  Bodyaches, headache, nausea, and dizziness continued throughout the day.  Late afternoon on 2/13 I started to itch and noticed hives all over my chest and abdominal area and also on my left arm just above the elbow, but not at the injection site.  On 2/14/2021, my husband called an urgent care line for suggestions as over the counter topical creams such as hydrocortisone and benadryl were not helping.  He was able to schedule a virtual appointment for me with a Health Clinic. She looked at the rash and prescribed Prednisone and Hydroxyzine.  I started taking them on 2/14 and my rash is still present but improving.  I no longer have a headache or bodyaches.  I am still experiencing some nausea and dizziness but with significant improvement/relief.

                                                I am currently a nursing mother and 24 hours following the vaccine my infant son, born 1/22/2020 (approximately 13 months old) presented with a rash (trunk), nausea and vomiting, lethargy, decreased mobility, and irritability.  Approximately 48 hours following my vaccine he presented with a rash on the backs of his shoulders as well as on each of his cheeks as well as a fever of 101.5 degrees. The fever was treated easily with Tylenol and did not return after the 6 hour mark.  At 60 hours post vaccine, he was evaluated by his pediatrician in person and evaluated. He was specifically checked for ear infection (negative), strep (negative), and COVID-19 (results not in yet). After the care provider&#39;s assessment it was determined that a report should be made regarding the incident and that I should contact the CDC regarding his reaction.

I experienced muscle and joint pain, which was to be expected.  Approximately 2 days afterwards, I started to experience dizziness, low blood pressure, and pressure in the middle of the back of my head.  The pressure became worse and worse, while continuing to experience the above side effects.  Since that time, I have been to the emergency room for pain all over, pressure in the back of the head, memory issues, blood in the stool, and extremely cold hands and feet without explanation.

I received my 1st dose of Moderna COVID vaccine around 5/45pm on Thursday 2/25 by a woman at the High School.  The shot felt fine at the time but I did notice she went a bit higher up on my shoulder.  However, the morning after, I was experiencing extreme shoulder pain with limited range of motion as the day progressed on 2/26. By night time of 2/26, I couldn?t remove my bra and had to ask my husband for assistance. I?m scared and terrified that I won?t be able to hold my newborn baby when he?s born. This is all I can think about. I don?t even care that I?m in severe pain. All I can think about is how this is going to ruin my experience caring for my child without full range in one of my arms. It?s 2:37am where I am and I can?t sleep because of the shoulder pain.

Zaleplon insufficient duration so switched to Zolpidem PRN. She has not required more than a few doses of zolpidem but now we have uptitrated her to gabapentin 600mg nightly. She feels significant improvement in her sleep and work product, but continues to have intermittent cognitive errors and some decrease in work performance, that remain concerning to her.

She stated the following symptoms came on &#34;Like a wave&#34;: Dizziness, light headedness, ears ringing, sound pulsing, and her vision began to go black. She described the field of vision closing like that of a loony toons show ending (coming from the outside in).   Patient was found to have her eyes closed, hyperventilating at a rate of 28 breaths per minute. Ice pack placed on her neck. She was coached to slow her breathing, instructed to hold her breath for 10 seconds, then to release it slowly. She did this for 3 minutes. She related her body felt tingly all over. Encouraged patient to continue the slow breathing. As patient began to feel better, she related that she has a known needle phobia. She expressed that she becomes anxious even when she is not the one receiving a shot, and this fear stems from a traumatic experience of her son having a seizure after a shot. She works at a school and when they do first aid training and cover the diabetes section, the pictures of needles make her anxious. Patient provided with therapeutic communication, encouraged to discuss fears with her counselor. Patient remained seated in clinic until she felt well enough for her husband to drive her home.

                                                I was eating lunch with friends around 1pm when I suddenly began having a tingling feeling all over my body. I became hot, flush, sweaty, and dizzy. I proceeded to the bathroom where I appeared pale. I took my pulse which was extremely slow (20-40bpm). I realized I may die or pass out. I reached for the door and I don&#39;t remember anything until waking up on the bathroom floor. I was able to get up on my own. I was able to compose myself and walk to my car. I got a ride home. I remained dizzy and having heart palpitations for about 1 hour. I did not seek medical care. I continued to having hot flashing and tingling feelings throughout the evening. Today, 3/5, I have joint pain and fatigue and occasional dizziness.

(However, I&#39;ve heard of other people having similar reactions, they all went to follow up in ER, or  primary care and all their cardiac labs and  other tests were WNL.)  Through out the day I experienced heart palpitations, fast heart beat, and some chest pressure.  3 days post vaccine I experienced some dizziness when walking through target. Afterwards I had some chest pain.  the feeling of Heaviness on my chest . Took tums helped a little then the feeling came back. Went for a 2 mile walk helped a little then came back. Watched tv,,  chest pressure was still there .   By one week post vaccine I felt completely normal, no chest pain, no dizziness, no heart palpitations. I did not seek care with a primary care or other providers because I assumed this was a strong immune response elicited by the second dose of the Covid vaccine. However, I was encouraged to report these symptoms

This continued for 2 full days with fever breaking then coming right back, repeatedly, even with taking Tylenol every 6 hours. The headache was unbearable day 1 but mild day 2.  Fever got up to 102.4 at one point but was between 100-101 most of the time during those two days. I was not able to function or get off the couch at all day 1 and at about 50% day 2. By day 3 post vaccination I felt completely back to normal besides a very sore and swollen arm still. This continued for about 6 days post shot.

                                                Here is my story. Part 1: I had my second Moderna vaccine on 2/16. 36 hours later I was laying In bed when I all of a sudden felt very strange- sort of faint - like I was going to pass out. Then I started feeling like my Body was going numb. We called 911. I was taken to the ER. What followed was about 15-20 ?neurological? episodes (every ten minutes or so) where my entire body from head to toe became paralyzed- I couldn?t move any of my limbs. I also had no sight. I was not blacked out Bc I could hear everything that was happening. It was also accompanied by extreme chest pain, numbness, contratcing of muscles in chest cavity that felt almost like a heart attack. Each individual episode lasted about 3-5 minutes and then slowly the paralysis would undo and I?d regain feeling. And then the full episodes would start over a few minutes later. This went on for a few hours repeatedly while in the ER.  I was admitted for testing  and monitoring for two days (EEG, EKG, MRI, Catscan) all clear. Once discharged I had lingering neurological symptoms but not the full paralysis episodes. Lingering symptoms included severe chest pain, numbness/weaknesses predominant on the left side as well as other random areas. I was very weak and tired. I started to improve very slowly - by day 10 post hospitalization I was starting to feel like things were turning the corner and maybe I was on my way to recovery. Part 2: I started to finally feel more improved from the lingering neurological issues and then all of a sudden around 5:30PM I was in the kitchen making dinner for my kids on 3/2 and the episodes started again. Called 911. Again, every ten minutes or so they came on (maybe 15-18 episodes) of complete paralysis- this time accompanied by seizure like rapid eye movement from side to side and fluttering of the eyes. I was readmitted to the hospital where the episodes repeated to happen again, maybe 15-20 times. I was admitted. They did a 24 hour video EEG which ?caught? the episodes on video and sound but did not appear negatively on the EEG in terms of abnormal brain activity. I?ve been released as they say there is nothing to do. I have lingering muscle weakness in my eyes- I can?t focus my eyeballs or ?track? on an eye exam and continued muscular chest pain. I also have a lot of PTSD from the trauma of the events.

That whole incident maybe lasted 10 seconds with throat tightness peaking at 6-7 seconds. I didn?t require epiPen or emergency care and the tightness went away 90% after 10 seconds with some minor difficulty swallowing for about additional 15 mins or so. I felt completely normal after 30 mins and have not had any other reactions since.

This has continued until the time of me filling out this form. I have menieres, so I had a dietetic (Dyazide) and antivert at hone, which I began taking immediately. On Saturday evening, I evened a prescription for a Medrol dose pack and that was started immediately. I have vertigo, difficulty walking due to it. I vomited once on date I day due to the vertigo. I have continued vertigo and nausea.

Treating with OTC meclizine 12.5 mg (3 to 4 times daily), or 25 mg (as needed) but seems to barely take the edge off the symptoms.  I am forcing  hydration and forcing myself to rest periodically during the day to help ease the discomfort.  Some days I feel the dizziness/lightheadedness are resolving but there are days when the symptoms are just as intense as the first day.

                                                Shortly after my vaccine, I experienced a copper taste in my mouth, felt dizzy and I indicated to a paramedic that I was not feeling well. I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

I got my second dose on Friday, March 12 at 1pm and woke up at 2am Saturday  with debilitating headache and severe nausea . I took tylenol and fell back asleep. I woke up again around 6am with the same severe headache and excruciating  pain in my left arm at the injection site and tried to get up to get some ibuprofen. I felt extremely dizzy and could barely walk which ended up in me fainting in the kitchen. I somehow got back to bed, took ibuprofen and went back to sleep. I started feeling better after that, severe headache went away but I had low grade fever, chills, slight nausea and painful arm the whole Saturday up until Sunday morning. I had dizziness on Sunday, was very tired on Monday and still felt weak on Tuesday but after that I recovered and experienced no more symptoms.

                                                Minutes after receiving the shot on Monday, 3/22/2021 at approximately 11:15am, I (F/37yo) felt a very small, but acute tightness/pressure in my upper right chest area. I didn&#39;t initially report it as it was not one of the listed reactions I had read about in the information given to me -- I assumed I was very anxious, maybe breathing nervously, and that it would go away. The next day I felt very fatigued, light-headed, had extreme muscle and joint pain throughout my body, slight nausea, and the injection site (my left arm) was very sore. I took Tylenol and slept.  I felt weak and &#34;off&#34; the whole day. The acute chest pain I felt after the shot had now become less &#34;acute&#34; and turned into a wider and duller general pressure. The next day, Tuesday, I also began feeling intermittent flashes of hot or cold-like patches in my head, which I also consider a part of a general inflammation my body might be having. It is now Thursday, 3/25/2021 and the chest pressure has increased even more, having now spread from the upper right side to include the center of my chest. My headache is still lingering, I still don&#39;t feel like my normal self and feel &#34;off&#34; somehow, and the chest pressure is worrying me because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on internally. I reported the chest pain to my doctor and was told that my exact reactions don&#39;t make any sense in relation to the known adverse reactions to the Moderna COVID vaccine. I was advised to report this here and to also go to an urgent care clinic or emergency room if my symptoms worsen.

Additionally, I have begun to experience extreme arthritis and muscular pain throughout my body, which begun 2 weeks after the 2nd dose. I have begun to lose function intermittently of my feet, fingers, and arms at different times throughout the day.

Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

Pain progressed as did stiffness within an hour to the point that I can barely move my neck without significant pain to neck and down into shoulder. It has been like this for almost 5 hours now and has not improved.   Prior to this - the day and night i got vaccinated I felt fine. the following day I had a pretty bad headache. And then this morning this new thing happened. I am not worried about the headache as that is normal. I am worried about this severe pain and stiffness that is localized in one part of my body and is not going away.

                                                Employee Recollection: Wednesday and Thursday  felt kind of weak and more tired than normal, but thought nothing of it.  In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

Tuesday I woke up within 20mins I was nauseous and threw up multiple times. My body was achy and just felt &#34;blah&#34;. Was weak and dizzy when I stood up. I felt like my insides were on fire (like the worst temperature you&#39;ve ever had) but didn&#39;t have a fever. Felt like my brain was going to swell out of my head and it was the worst headache. I slept all day. Woke up long enough to call the dr and fell back asleep. Halfway through the day I ended up with a fever of 102 (it went down after a few hrs). Today I woke up still feeling weak and somewhat dizzy, spacey.

I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

                                                I  got it at 2pm Friday.  About 2 hours later my arm started feeling sore but not too bad. I did some light yoga and walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.  Otherwise took it easy that day. Satu I woke up with a slight headache which isn&#39;t unusual for me.  I still had mild soreness in my arm. I did a more difficult yoga workout and then walked 5 miles outside.  Took a shower after and relaxed for a bit. Then had dinner around 5 and within the hour started having diarrhea.  This lasted a few hours during which my arm started gradually hurting more, it was pretty bad. Could barely move it and hurt to the touch even. Shivering started soon after.  I never had a fever or fatigue during all of this. Highest temp was 98.4 with forehead thermometer. I talked to a doctor to put my mind at ease and he said I was having a big immune response to the vaccine, apparently younger adults between 20 to 40 are having bigger immune responses. The second dose is stronger so most are  having these symptoms after that one, but some are having it after the first as well. He also told me I should have taken it easy these past 2 days and that I likely overdid it. He advised that I take motrin or Tylenol, get under blankets to stay warm, and rest. That&#39;s exactly what I did and a little over an hour later I was feeling much better.   I&#39;m a bit freaked out by what the second dose is going to do to me since it is supposed to be worse.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

                                                Vaccine given at 2pm. By 9pm that same night I could not move my arm without crying from the pain.  I woke upbat 5am and the pain was still just as bad. Any little movement was excruciating. I could not change my clothes, brush my hair, wash my face. The only reason I waa still able to work is because I am a teacher and we are remote so I was able to sign on from home and sit at my desk with my arm in an imaginary swing because that was the only time it did not hurt. Later that night I could begin to move my arm a little before pain started but still needed help getting dressed, etc. The next two days I was able to move it little more before pain started.  It is now 5 days later and I can lift my arm up. I still feel pain but it ia tolerable.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 10 minutes after receiving vaccine throat began tingling and I noticed my heart rate was 164 on my apple watch.  Notified nursed overseeing the monitoring.  Nurses began hooking my up to monitoring equipment. Heart rate came down to 120.  Nurses noticed flushing in face and blotchiness on arms. After an additional 15 minutes of monitoring, flushing was still present as well as throat tingling (just tingling, no swelling), so nurses sent me to the ER for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to ER temperature was 100.2 F. (Temperature before vaccine was 97 F, no fevers recorded after ER visit).  In ER fluids and zofran were given and was released after two hours of monitoring.  In the evening I experienced moderate pain in the left arm (very painful to lift arm above shoulder level) that lasted about 24 hours.  I also had a mild to moderate headache that lasted about 24 hours, beginning the evening of the vaccine.   I also experienced mild to moderate nausea that began the day of the vaccine (Saturday, 12/26) and was on and off through Wednesday, 12/30.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

Spent a couple hours on a gurney being monitored. My blood pressure (normally low/normal) went up to 170/101. And my heart rate was in the 140s. My oxygen saturation at one point was 82% but I was not having any trouble breathing and was breathing normally. I had a terrible headache and was shaking uncontrollably for about 20 min. Eventually I felt well enough to go to work. About five hours after my shot, I passed out again. I was taken to emergency room. My blood pressure was high and my heart rate was still elevated. They ruled out anything being wrong and eventually sent me home. I had a migraine and fatigue for two days. I felt tired for two weeks. And everything that usually  hurts, hurt extra bad.

                                                Left arm pain began on Thurs. 1/7/21, approximately 30 minutes after vaccine.  Severe headache and pain radiating to left side of neck began approximately 22 hours after vaccine (around 2pm on 1/8/21) and left arm pain worsened.  On 1/9/21, unable to get out of bed-felt like I had been drugged- severe HA, fatigue, and left side of neck soreness.  Felt slightly better on 1/10/21 and 1/11/21, however stil unable to get out of bed due to severe HA and fatigue.  On morning of 1/12/21, fatigue relieved and severe HA relieved around 1pm.  Since 1/12/21, Severe HA, left arm tightness and left neck soreness has continued intermittently.  This is a HA I have never experienced before.  Yesterday, on 1/21/21, I had a severe HA all day at work and when I went home, I had to lie down the rest of the day/evening d/t severe HA, fatigue and left neck tightness.  I was unable to do daily chores and help my children with their homework.  I also woke up this morning with the same severe HA and left neck soreness/tightness.  I do feel this HA is from the vaccine as I have never experienced this type of HA prior to receiving the vaccine and I am not someone who gets HA&#39;s often.    I know the vaccine was given too high, as I give vaccines often for my career, and I am wondering if that has anything to do with my neck pain.  I did bleed a lot with the injection (do not think it went into my muscle) and am wondering if that has anything to do with my adverse reaction.  I am fearful these severe HA&#39;s will continue and I am extremely hesitant to receive my second dose!

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was dizzy. I sat down where they had us wait and the dizziness wouldn&#39;t go away. Became difficult to swallow - felt like a lump in my throat. More difficult to breathe then normal. Vitals taken. BP taken. Feeling like I had an epidural. Legs had a sensation like they were going numb and then they went numb. Benadryl injection given. Legs felt like they fell asleep. Waited and within second 30 min timeframe I was feeling a lot better so I left. 2:30 in the morning, my legs were asleep again and the lump came back in my throat and took Benadryl and it went away and I felt fine. I went to work the next day. At 7:00 that evening felt chilled and it came and went. I came up and took more Benadryl and rested.I went to work the next day and I sent a message to my Primary Care DR. - but leg was fine and the lump in throat wasn&#39;t there. On Saturday morning - after 10 days - had a headache that would not go away  (Very severe headache)- took Tylenol 1000 mg it didn&#39;t work. It was very bad Saturday night I took another Tylenol 1000 and Sunday morning it - headache still wasn&#39;t gone. Leg was numb again. This time the leg  numbness was worse than ever had felt. Left axilla - there was a lump/nodule and it was painful. Tried TeleHealth Med and they recommended I go to ER but I didn&#39;t feel good enough to do it. Dr.  I reached out to her and she took the history and she prescribed Prednisone; but wanted me to do a COVID test and Urine sample to see how I was doing before I took the medication so I did it next the day. Urine sample was clean. Prednisone 60 for four days 40 for four days and 20 for four days - On day Prednisone my legs feel fine, but the headache just lingers. On day two of Prednisone she told me to stop the Benadryl. Three days after Prednisone the lump under axilla resolved. I am taking coffee. Headache is still there but not as severe.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after administration, my arm from my elbow up through my clavicle was extremely sore and painful to the touch. It hurt to even touch the skin in that region (extending from elbow to neck). The intense pain lasted for 3 days, and I was unable to lift my arm laterally for two of those three days, and other range of motion was very limited. My arm was hot and tender, and pain in my clavicle lasted well beyond a week. Even after icing it and using ibuprofen, the pain and sensitive skin issue remained.

                                                Received second COVID vaccine Moderna on Wednesday evening at 6pm.  Later that night, I was a little light-headed and achey, but went to bed. On thursday, my legs and arms were extremely achy. I took Tylenol and Motrin in the morning. It seemed to help some, but continued to feel very achy in my legs. I left work early (I am a pediatrician) on Thursday and went home and just sat and rested.  I felt terrible, but had talked to other colleagues who felt very bad that first day after the shot. Friday morning, I woke up still achy but feeling better overall. I took motrin and Tylenol again on Friday morning. I worked the whole day seeing patients. Was tired, but got thru the workday. At around 6pm, I noticed petechiae rash on my lower legs. The rash started spreading thru the night- up my legs and to my arms. I went to ER. They did order CBC, CMP. Platelets were undetectable- 1 platelet was seen under microscope. CMP was normal.  I was told to go to bigger hospital. I went, My platelets read as 4. I was admitted for two nights. Two doses of IVIG were given and I was put on Decadron 40mg PO daily for 4 days. I had tylenol, benadryl, zofran before the IVIG and after.  I will see Hematology next week for follow up. Platelets yesterday at discharge were 60.  Will be checked frequently for the next few months. ITP= diagnosis. COVID shot was trigger.

Have felt heavy, arm sore, heart rate high, and tired after this event today.

Also experienced palpitations, and some nausea and lightheaded ness.  This lasted for about 25 minutes.  Went to the ER  and was monitored.

Rest of day, some nausea returned along with expected fatigue and headache until 28 hours after injection.

Basically it feels like a bruise when I flex my bicep it hurts there or when my arm is relaxed at my side the pressure hurts in the armpit. It is not superficial .

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

Friday = slept all day, very tired. Saturday night I went to ER because it hurt so bad: they gave me Lidocaine patches to help with pain but it didn&#39;t help. Monday, the 4th of January, saw my dr. - he was prescribed pain -Percocet 10/325 .That helped me so I could raise my arm finally. January 5th, I was still sick and woke up with a huge migraine; nauseous and fatigue/ I vomited once that night. Jan 6, I could work that day - but still fatigued, short of breath, but no fever at all, nauseous. January 7th - everything was gone (all symptoms resolved) and I felt fine.

My brain was telling me to walk forward and my legs were stumbling all over as I tried to walk. I went back to sleep and woke up hours later more stable but still with my head feeling very light(not quite dizzy). I was slightly nauseous and just blah most of the next day. I?d get slightly out of breath when talking for awhile. I was in a deep fog. To the point it took a few minute to process the sound my dog made with it coming from him. Overall, I felt like I was drugged or really intoxicated. I worry about my 2nd dose!

                                                My arm became quite sore about 8 hours after my initial vaccination.  It was sensitive to the touch to the point that I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body.  It also hurt to raise my arm any higher than shoulder height.  It went away on its own after about 36 hours.  One week later, on January 7th, my husband noticed that I had a large red patch on my arm where I had gotten the vaccination.  It was about 1.5-2&#34; across, raised, red and warm to the touch.  It was slightly itchy, but didn&#39;t hurt.  My husband noticed this in the evening, but I am not sure how long it had been that way since I had had long sleeves on all day.  By the morning, it had gone away.  I didn&#39;t treat it in any way.

                                                Severe arm pain within 30 minutes of administration. Pain radiates down entire left arm to fingertips and up to left side of neck. Range of motion is limited. With the first dose of Moderna my left arm was sore for 3 days after the injection, range of motion was limited by pain, however, I was still able to actively move my arm through all planes. With this 2nd dose active range of motion is limited due to pain, unable to achieve full range of motion without physically assisting with right arm. When actively assisting, the left arm is still limited due to pain. I did call Walgreens the same day that the dose was given at 3:13 PM to inquire about this reaction. I was told to take OTC for the pain.

                                                5 mins after the shot I felt light headed, nauseated, weak in the knees. I drank water and tried to eat a small snack. I started getting really cold and began shivering and had GI discomfort. At the 20&#43; minute mark I went to get the nurse. She returned with BP cuff and pulse ox, BP was elevated as was pulse. I continued to have waves of feeling weak, shaky and sick but nurse said I should go home an lie down at the hour mark. Once home my throat felt really dry and strange, I had a BM, laid in bed about 20 more minutes and decide decided I wanted to get check out. Went to ER and was seen ~3 hours after vaccine. BP and heart rate were still both up. I still felt nauseated, dizzy and cold. I was given Meclizine and Zofran. BP retuned closer to normal after about 40 mins and I was released, feeling better but fatigued.

The soreness now radiated down the whole left side of my body. Right side had no pain. I drank a bunch of water and went to bed around 9:30pm. At 5:30 am my temp was 102.4 . I took ibuprofen.  I still felt exhausted. I had the worst headache of my life. The room was spinning if I lifted my head. I fell back asleep and woke around 1pm my fever was down to 99.9 by 2:30pm my temp was normal. I still have a headache and my left side is still very sore. I still feel exhausted. It&#39;s now 5:30pm and I am starting to get the chills again. I will continue to monitor my progress.

                                                On 2/12/21,&#34;almost two weeks after the vaccine was received, I started having sever muscle spasms. They were shooting through the right side of my neck and shoulder. Any sudden movement or wrong movement triggered the spasms.  Even taking too deep of a breath triggered the spasms.  Using my left arm to lift something triggered the spasms. My pain level that day was at a 10&#43;. On Saturday the spasms had subsided, but I  still had very limited ROM in my neck. It felt like my neck muscles had been over worked and my neck felt weak. Pain continued and I went my doctor on Monday 2/15/21. After me explaining to him the course of events and letting him know I did not do anything at all that could have caused an injury,  he felt this was a reaction to the Covid vaccine I had gotten on 2/1/21. He advised me to take my muscle relaxer that he had already prescribed to me and to use a heating pad.  He gave me some exercises to do with my neck and prescribed me Hydrocodone 5-325 mg to take as needed every 8 hours for pain. He told me if it got worse or did not get better to follow-up with him.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:25 pm on Saturday Feb 13th. I woke up early Sunday unable to sleep due to all over body aches and joint pain. I did not have a fever at any point. I had chills off and on, but mostly horrible body aches everywhere. My left arm was also extremely sore. I knew this was all normal so I was not at all worried. Then Sunday evening my right knee started aching more than the rest of my body and started swelling. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. When I woke up Monday morning it was severely swollen and bright red and heat was radiating  from it.  I had to take a day off of work because I stand at work and it was making it much worse. So I iced it and elevated it and took ibuprofen, but it remained swollen and red and very painful. I was unable to bend the knee and couldn&#39;t crouch down or bend the knee to sit.  On Wednesday morning I went to my doctor at the clinic on the advice or a friend that is a nurse and a friend that is a pharmacist. See below (item 19) for what was prescribed. This took away the severe swelling within about a day and a half, but it&#39;s still painful and achy and hurts to bend. There is also still a bump on the top of my knee.  The all over body aches and joint pain lasted until about Friday the 19th . I have photos of my knee if you would like them.

                                                Normal ache/pain in my left arm associated with second Moderna vaccination for 36-48hr post vaccine. Around morning on 2/20, I noticed my arm still hurt considerably but pain was more a shooting pain with certain movements, rather than a general sore/ache. Pain progressively got worse over the next several days and movement was quite restricted to avoid pain with movement. Lateral and overhead movements were not possible. The injection was given rather high up on my left shoulder and injection site/surrounding area was very sore for one week, but has diminished. I am currently taking 800mg Ibuprofen 2x/day which seems to help.

Pain becomes worse when the arm is used and is severe enough to somewhat limit mobility.  Pain responded well to over the counter medication. Pain decreased somewhat overnight but is still present and mobility is still limited.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

                                                I was scheduled to get the vaccine at 9:30 on Feb. 27th, 2021 and most likely got it around 10 due to waiting. Around 6:30 that evening I got very dizzy and shaky and needed to sit down. The next day I was very tired, had a headache, very foggy minded, an upset stomach, and the injection site hurt bad. I slept a lot that day. On the 1st of March I am feeling tired and have an even worse headache and have had an upset stomach and am tired.

                                                Within 90 seconds I had severe vertigo and a severe migraine.  In about 5 minute the vertigo subsided to a moderate enough level that I could walk to the observation room.  Over the subsequent 30 minute period I started itching and feeling generally awful like the flu and was a bit nauseous. My BP and Pulse were within acceptable limits though so I was released to go home.     As the evening wore on I developed a light rash down my arm. My PCP Dr. proscribed some different OTC medications to halt the allergic reaction I seemed to be having (based on its similarity to some of my food allergy reactions).    I took these treatments for 36 hours.   I woke the next morning with a severe autoimmune flare up that had me unable to get up without a cane for assistance.  I had no fever but felt feverish.  I was in a lot of pain all over. My injection site was very swollen and had a hives ring around it that lasted for about 5 days.   The total reaction from initial allergic reaction through the flare up lasted 8 days. Additionally, I take weekly allergy shots.  Prior to the vaccine I had to reaction to these shots (desired result).  Since then, I have a mild bout of vertigo after each allergy shot (indicating my immune over-response has been hyped up).

Has experienced 5/10 pain at same location every day since, for almost one month.  Tylenol and Motrin have not helped to reduce the shoulder pain.  EE has been unable to sleep on her left side.  Per EE email; &#34;The RN that gave me the vaccine went very high and injected at my shoulder bone.&#34;  No other symptoms.  EE stated that she is visiting her NP next week for an assessment of left shoulder.

                                                I received the shot at 8am. By noon, the injection site was very sore. By 2pm, I could not move my arm without excruciating pain from my shoulder all the way down to my left ring and pinkie fingers. I was not able to lift my arm on my own, it was as if my muscles were not recognizing the brain signals. If I lifted my left arm using my right, I could move it about an inch. Anything more than that was so painful that it brought tears to my eyes. Pain relievers did not help. It took almost 5 days to regain function of my arm, and I am still experiencing muscle pain when I try to stretch my arm or lift a heavy weight.

Pain began shooting down my arm through my fingertips.  Nausea and vomiting started at 2:00 a.m. followed by fever, chills, body aches (pretty bad - couldn&#39;t move at all without shooting pain through my body), and headache (bad, but not awful).   Nausea and vomiting lasted until 7:00 a.m.  Fever, chills, body aches, and headache began to subside around 4:00 p.m.  They didn&#39;t fully go away until Thursday morning.

She felt very tired and woozy almost right away.  She developed severe headache and aches/chills the next day. She was seen in RC the next day, also with severe jaw pain.  she was given oral rehydration packets, zofran, toradol.  The next day she couldn&#39;t tolerate po, had to have IVF and zofran.  She felt better after the visit on 2/18/21.  She still gets some mild nausea and intermittent migraines. Is concerned re: her lithium as potentially contributing to the dehydration, so pt reduced her dose and is feeling somewhat better but is still needing her imitrex relatively regularly.

                                                Mar 5-2:30pm: arm began to feel sore. Mar6-12:00am  I can barely lift my left arm above chest level. The soreness has traveled from the injection site down to my wrist and fingers. The injection site is slightly pink, not really noticeable, and warm to the touch. I start to feel a little nauseous and also starting to get body aches and chills. From 12:00am-4:00am i constantly wake up because of arm soreness and body aches. At 4:00am, I woke up  to use the restroom and realized even the bottom of my feet hurt with every step I took. Took my temperature and it was at 101.5.  I went back to bed and fell asleep even though I kept waking. At 7:00am, the migraine started. I was trying to avoid taking meds just to be able to get a clear picture of how my body responds to the vaccine, But by 9:30am (22hrs post vaccine) I ended up taking Tylenol for severe migraine. It feels like someone is stabbing my temples with a very sharp object. Turning or even slightly moving my head strengthens the migraine. My arm is still so sore that I can barely move it!  Tylenol brings temperature down to 100.7°. 10:30am I began with extreme fatigue. By 12:30pm I went back to bed because I couldn?t stand my body aches and migraine. I slept until 4:00pm woke up feeling a little better. Migraine was still there but not as bad. At 8:00pm I began to feel pressure on my chest. That pressure slowly turned into pain. By 9:20pm I was in excruciating pain, I was in tears and I literally thought I was going to die. It hurt to breath. I checked into the ER by 9:30pm the pain was sharp and it would come, last a few minutes, then slowly ease off a bit. On a scale of 1-10 if was definitely a TEN!!!! The ER said it wasn?t cardiac so they sent me home. The DR did say that the chest pain could have possibly been caused by the vaccine, as many have seen different symptoms and everyone has reacted differently. I was home by 1:15am. The pains continued until 3:00am. By 8:30am on Sunday Mar 7, the only thing I was suffering from was soreness in the arm and my chest was sore from the pain. The pain in my chest was a 1 or 2 compared to the 10 that it was when I went to the ER, And that pain/discomfort has lingered all day.  I?m currently 22weeks 4days pregnant with a boy and expected to deliver July 7th. I?ve been pregnant 19 times have 4 living children and suffered 14miscarriages.

                                                Hives/rash developed within 15 minutes, was injected with 25mg of Benadryl. Another 15 minutes or so later it had become hard to swallow, I was given another 25mg dose of Benadryl. After the second dose  it became hard to breathe, started coughing and chest started to hurt. I didn?t realize but had broke out in sweat. Nurse checked my eyes. Called paramedics and had epi pen ready. I thought a third dose of Benadryl had been administered but that I am not certain of. Blood pressure was higher than my usual but still considered normal (113/82 I think?) pulse was 120 something, at rest I am usually at 70. I became lightheaded. Paramedics did an ekg, it was normal. They monitored me while I stabilized. Was released when pulse was in the 80?s range. Residual chest pain after. 8 days after vaccination I broke out in sweat and became nauseous. Vomited. I then noticed below the vaccination injection (still bruised) and around where last dose of Benadryl was injected there was a large red welp, hot to the touch. The heat eventually went away but the welp remained a few days. 11 days after vaccination is when the cluster headache appeared. Shortness of breath was noticeable on day 12. Day 14 fever and nasal congestion with slight irritation in throat, occasional cough. Day 15 sore throat, coughing progressed (non productive) in to fits that led to vomiting. It is day 18 and shortness of breath is present at rest, chest pain, rash near injection site and bruise is still present. Temp has been low grade fever, hadn?t gone above 100. Normal is 96.9/97.1 for me. Oddly day 13 (the day before fever became present) my temp was lower than usual 95.6/95.7 yet I wasn?t cold.

I had some chills and arm pain the day after the 2nd shot and where I got the shot it was hard, raised, Red and hot to the touch. And a slight headache. I woke up today 3/21/21 and my arm still hurts and it seems like the knot is even bigger with redness and still hot to the touch.

                                                I had an eardrum spasm the afternoon of my first Moderna shot, followed by lingering ear pain and fullness.  I have continued to have ear pain along with my ears popping when swallowing and increased sensitivity to noise. I also experienced intermittent moments of near vertigo that has since improved. The ear pain continues now 2 1/2 weeks later along with ear drum discomfort. My doctor has advised me to begin taking allergy medication despite no history of allergies in the past.

                                                got her first Moderna COVID19 vaccination on Wednesday 03/10/2021. She had no immediate problems with the shot such as arm pain or any other concerns, but by the next day 03/11/2021 she woke feeling very exhausted. They were having tests, and she is one of the main people in charge of this, so she just wrote it off as a reaction to stress. However as the day went on she was feeling worse including low-grade chronic headache, nausea, intermittent palpitations and waves of dizziness. She even had a little anxiety attack, thus she went home Thursday afternoon. She forced herself to go back to school the next day, knowing that if she could get through that day, she&#39;d have a whole week off for spring break. Unfortunately, despite decreased stress, she continued to feel poorly. She has a feeling of profound fatigue, constant headache at the base of the skull that Tylenol really doesn&#39;t touch, nausea, stomach rumbling, intermittent dizziness, and intermittent palpitations.  Not surprisingly, her anxiety has increased, so she started sertraline 25 mg one half tab on Tuesday 03/16/2021, and on Saturday 03/20/2021 she increased it to a full tab. Now taking PharmaGABA at night to keep the anxiety and heart racing down.

It seemed to be going away but the next night I was woken up in the middle of the night with extreme throbbing pain in my right knee. It was swollen but no injury had occurred. I couldn?t put any weight on it. I went to health. They diagnosed it as patellar bursitis with unknown cause. They checked my blood and ruled out gout and or trauma as a cause. My blood showed signs of an immune reaction (possible infection) but it was 2 days after vaccination. To be safe they put me on a 10 day course of antibiotics because of the rapid onset they were afraid it might be a localized infection that could spread (but couldn?t determine a cause as there was no injury or broken skin in the area).  I couldn?t put any weight on my knee and dr advised 3 days off work to elevate, compress, and ice. I am still using a knee brace at work and it is still mildly swollen. No known cause or signs of trauma.

I caught her and had her lay down for 5 minutes. Afterwards, she felt better to sit down, and then we checked her BP. Her BP reading was 75/46 mmHg. She stated she was feeling waves of faintness. We called ambulance about 10 minutes after her BP reading. Patient was still laying with her head resting at her side. After taking another BP reading, it came out to be about 98/70 mmHg. Patient stated she was feeling slightly better. Ambulance arrived about 10 minutes later and advised her to go with them to confirm she was doing okay.

Then after that the fatigue stayed with some low grade temperature spikes off and on but never above 100.4. Took Tylenol. Then about a week after the vaccine I started feeling very fatigued. Hot all over like my skin was burning, and fatigued and weakness progressed. These symptoms were are first sporadic then progressed to daily. Eventually experience limb numbness, started having difficulty speaking. So fatigued I could barely get out of bed. Finally I got in to see the doctor after calling off from work for being to ill. Medical leave started 3/3/21 officially. I was hospitalized on 3/9/21 after symptoms progressed even worse to right sided facial weakness and body weakness with some left sided involvement. I stayed the night. All lab work and MRInwas conducted. All were pretty much. Normal. Neurologist hyppothisixed it was a combination of the vaccine causing a POtS flare with my system and the trialing of metoprolol for almost two weeks after my second shot, but the medication is hard to say. He said it was more likely due to my bodies reaction to the vaccine. My cytokine levels was not drawn until over a month later and it high. Currently I can still barely function 1-2 hours a day in intervals.

                                                Starting  just a few hours after the immunization I had a red swollen rash around the injection sight, about the size of a nickel. It was painful, but not anymore then a regular flu immunization. I thought I was possibly just reacting to the bandage. However, by the end of the night the redness and swelling had grown to about the size of a silver dollar. The next morning it had swollen to the size of a baseball, was red inflamed and warm to the touch. It only itched when it was touched by something, but was quite sore. I tried some Benadryl cream and took my normal allergy pills I also started using an ice pack trying to keep the heat and swelling down. None of this seemed to help. I also started to feel dizzy and had a headache, normal reactions to immunizations. I did sleep off and on all day this first day after the immunization as I felt weak and dizzy. The swelling just kept getting larger and large no matter what I tried. The second day after the immunization the swelling was around the size of a soft ball, and it was very red, inflamed and almost hot to the touch. Again I used Zyrtec, Benadryl cream and also tried a washcloth soaked with witch hazel, this did not seem to help. Later I went to a friends house and she had some Triamcinolone cream and colloidal silver, I tried both of these and the swelling and warmth did start going down. The redness has stayed about the same (now about the size of a grapefruit). It has started itching, but not constant, and not like my typical allergy itch.

                                                On my 12th minute in the waiting area, I started having itchiness on my legs then it spread to my arms and face. I felt lightheaded and started having difficulty breathing. I approached the paramedic nearby. By then, the itchiness was all over my body from head to toe. They alerted 911 and monitored my vital signs. My 02 sat was 100% and BP was 140/90 mmHg. I asked if I can take Benadryl. They said wait for the ambulance. I declined to go to the hospital unless my symptoms get worse. I then took 25 mg of Benadryl. Shortness of breath and lightheaded ness was slightly relieved but the itchiness was still there. I waited for 30 more minutes in the waiting area. When the itchiness subsided a little bit, I went home. After 3 hours, the itchiness and SOB returned so I called my PCP and I was informed to take Benadryl q4 hrs until symptoms are resolved. As of today, 1/12/21 at 7:18pm, I still have itchiness but not as bad as yesterday.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

Was feeling a little tired throughout the day and around 9 pm noticed I was starting to notice some mild flu skin, body aches and headache.  Went to bed around 10 and had slight shivering but figured it was maybe just a low grade fever and covered up with another blanket.  Within 20 minutes I had full blown rigors. My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn&#39;t so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night. Slept on and off all through the day 1-19-21 taking acetaminophen 2 more times for headache and sore body. Went to bed around 10 pm and woke up back to normal 1-20-21

                                                I had burning at the injection site immediately after receiving the vaccine. As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine last Thursday (1/14/21) at clinic and had a pretty severe reaction within a few minutes of the receiving the vaccine. I didn?t alert anyone because I wasn?t sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. I felt hot suddenly, then very dizzy/faint, then experienced very bad tinnitus and couldn?t hear any of the words being spoken around me, just muffled sounds. I felt slightly nauseous, was seeing spots, and felt very close to fainting. My pulse was racing. I did deep breathing  until it subsided (which was about 10 minutes later). For the next 5 days after the vaccine, I experience extreme soreness and weakness in the left arm where the injection was given. I also had redness and itching and it was hot to the touch and slightly swollen. I had extreme fatigue and a headache and a loss of appetite. After 5 days, those subsided. 1 week after the vaccine (01/21/21),  I experienced intense itching at the injection site and redness and it was hot to the touch. I also experienced intense itching on my chin and skin numbness in that area of my chin. The chin area resolved after about 4 hours. The arm itching did not resolved. i woke up on 01/22/21 with the entire left shoulder area swollen, red, hot to the touch, and extremely itchy. it lasted all day. I woke up on 01/23/21 and the swelling had gone down, but the redness spread to a larger area on the upper left arm and the itching persisted all day. I woke up on 01/24/21 and the redness and swelling was almost gone but the itching was still there and the area that had swollen up felt very bruised, but no visible bruising. Today (01/25/21) there is no more itching or redness but the bruised sensation continues.

I had a rash around site that progressed up to the right side of my face and also right side of my lower back the following day. The rash was also accompanied by blotches and is still there only on the side of the injection. I had metallic taste for on and off the first 2-3 days. I am feeling a bit better, well enough to work today. Still very fatigued. On Thursday I also had a 102 fever that Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help me at all at night. I finally stopped sweating yesterday. The blotches are now improving . Only thing that remains is the fatigue.

                                                A few seconds of the injection I experienced moderate light headedness which resolved quickly.  The following morning I began experiencing moderate aches and pains, generalized malaise which resolved quickly with Tylenol.  As the progressed, the achiness and increased and did not resolve quickly with Tylenol.  By 2:30 pm that day, I experienced chills that did not stop, and pain in the bones of my legs that felt like flashes of extreme heat, especially on the femur.  I began experiencing nausea. That night I was unable to sleep more than 3 hours.  Around 1 am of January 27th I began feeling chills, and pain once again.  I took Tylenol, and after a short while I began sweating.  Generally, the pain, chills, and burning sensation stopped that morning, however the nausea continued through the day, especially after trying to eat.

I couldn&#39;t even turn over due to the pain I was feeling. I felt like my body had been hit by a truck, it brought me to tears several times. It continued for about 13 hours and then it was gone, just like that. I took 400mg ibuprofen and benadryl every 4 hours from 6am - 4pm that day and by 5pm I felt no more medication was needed and just like that it was over.

Upon returning to work in the pharmacy, she sat down at her desk and noted her HR to be 159 via her Apple watch. She felt slightly lightheaded, so returned to  Auditorium for monitoring. On arrival, she complained only of high HR, no other symptoms. We checked her VS: BP 140/78, HR 132, RR 20, SaO2 94. She denied chest pain or SOB. We monitored her for about 15 minutes, and her HR decreased to 103-110. We monitored her for another 15 minutes or so, at which time her HR spiked again to 132, and she felt heavy in her chest and tight in her throat. At that point, we moved her to a gurney and called a Rapid Response. We administered 50mg of Benadryl IM per protocol, foregoing the Epinephrine, due to her tachycardic state. The Rapid Response team arrived and she was transported to the ED for evaluation. She maintained consciousness and was A&amp;Ox3 the entire time.

I called the cardiologist and she was not surprised and said I could take double the dose of my meds for 1-2 days and to do the same on the second dose. I felt much better the next day.   Appx 8 days after the injection I developed a 2 in halo of inflamed skin, redness, and itchiness. I took Benadryl and it improved but returned today (day 9). It is mild and I will continue to watch this. It is similar to my flu shot reaction though delayed one week rather than immediate.

My lips were getting numb. I was confused and unable to participate in a work phone call I answered.  12:45 I began driving as I felt a little better. Drove 2 miles and pulled over to park and wait it out. Heart still racing, hives still present, chest pains still there and could not inhale deeply.  12:50 I drove the rest of the way home. I took a double dose of liquid Benadryl and laid down waiting for symptoms to pass. They slowly resolved over the next 6 hours.  It is now 1/30/21 and I still feel like crap, but not allergy wise. More like the flu.

                                                Pt here today for her second dose of Moderna COVID vaccine. States she did not have any issues with her first dose. Pt does endorse hx of syncope.    Approximately 10 minutes after pt received vaccine, she started to feel dizzy and faint and was slouched over in her chair. Pt pale, flushed, tangibly warm and sweaty skin. Transferred pt to stretcher. Pt endorses that she did have breakfast this morning. Felt slightly nervous about getting the vaccine but not overly anxious.    Vitals taken: BP 95/59, HR 75, O2 99%. Rapid response called. Rapid response nurse arrived at bedside.    Repeat vitals, taken approximately 5 minutes apart:  BP 109/63, HR 96, O2 99% BP 109/63, HR 97, O2 99% BP 114/77, HR 108, O2 99% BP 101/70, HR 99, O2 100% BP 106/62, HR 97, O2 100%   Pt given juice with some improvement in symptoms.

ED MD notes: &#34;MDM, ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Overall well-appearing 39 year female experiencing lightheadedness after vaccination.  She has no other signs or symptoms to suggest an acute allergic reaction.  This may be vasovagal.  Plan for urine pregnancy test and EKG, consider IV fluids.  Patient prefers not to undergo testing unless completely necessary.  We decided to obtained orthostatic vital signs and if patient is symptomatic and/or showing significant changes in blood pressure or pulse with positional change, then will proceed with limited workup for near syncope.   DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES O2 sat interpretation: normal on RA Equivocal orthostats - HR incr w/ standing but so did BP. Pt states she&#39;s feeling better, tolerating po. Again denies poss pregnancy. Prefers to go home. OK to dc, close return precautions.     IMPRESSION: Dizziness. Adverse medication (vaccination) reaction, not allergy.&#34;

                                                The next two days I had a sore arm. But a week later, the following Monday and Tuesday, I had fatigue and headaches. I put the date as Wednesday because that is when the concerning possible reactions began. I woke with clogged ears feeling very sick. I took Advil Cold and Sinus and arranged to miss work. It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected. My ankles were also very tender as I had done a little jogging the day before and I normally walk. As the day progressed I was barely able to get out of bed. Sleeping and just laying there. My highest temperature was 101.25 at 2:45 pm. I had severe chills on and off. I reported these afflictions and was mailed a covid test by Thursday. The test came back negative by Friday evening. Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm. The oddness of that being where my shot was given is what makes me wonder if it was an extreme reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it is a flu. I have never had the body pains I try to describe before.

                                                In the evening of receiving the vaccine, I started to feel brief sharp pains in my chest/ back.  Overnight, I was awoken by continued shooting  pains all over my body, and also fine shaking.  Around 2AM a headache started and progressed to be the worst headache of my life.  It was received in the morning by tylenol.  In the morning, I experienced extreme exhaustion and dizziness after climbing stairs I almost passed out, had to rest on the floor.  Later in the day I experienced hours of chills, a temp to 103, which came down with tylenol. By the evening I was feeling well but tired.  Today, 2 days after vaccination, I have neck soreness and am a little tired but well.

Felt fine by 3pm the next day.

And my whole arm got really hot. Got really hot, dizzy. I immediately threw up. They wanted to call EMS but I told them not to do that - and that I would go to the doctor myself. I went home and did what the hospital told me to do the first time - rest; fluids, Tylenol; this time my fever went up to 103. 2 and it went down but shot back up. Started coughing an hour after I got this shot and it was more than last time. Dry mouth and horrible headache. I still have a knot in my arm. Didn&#39;t have that before the 2nd dose. My fever just broke today finally. Still have headaches; body aches a little bit.  Mostly resolved otherwise.

Got light headed. Blood Pressure - sky high; Started throwing up immediately. I had chills; fever 102.3 - all in a matter of twenty minutes from taking shot. They took me to the ER and was there all day Saturday and Sunday morning for observation (wasn&#39;t admitted officially) and I was able to go home. I had had COVID in the past  - April 19, 2020 and so they thought that&#39;s why I had a reaction to the shot. After three days, I felt fine. My arm was still hurting but I was fine. I missed work for those three days. I had developed a cough (within  a couple hours of the vaccine) and it went to a dry cough three or four hours after the shot. ; fever; chills -felt like I had when I had COVID. They told that since the vaccine had potassium in it - that my body went into shock because my body was so low in potassium.

Fever began 6 hours post vax, along with pain (level 6/10 progressing to  8/10 at peak fever)  in lower back, and neck, and some sternal pain/anxious feeling. Fever peaked at 12 hours post vax at 102.9. Fever down to 101.5 the next morning upon rising, and down to 100.5 by 08:30 that morning (about 24 hours post vax). At 24 hours post vax, still somewhat weak, with head/neck/back pain, but improving, down to 5/10 on pain scale. Did NOT treat with medications, treated with lots of fluids, rest.

                                                I had previous anaphylaxis events that were treated and did not require hospitalization. I brought epinephrine pen and premedicated with Xyzal 5mg 9 hours before and Benadryl 25mg 1.5 hours before vaccine. 20 minutes after vaccine I felt flushing, nausea, low blood pressure. They had released me from the drive through vaccination site and I was driving and felt panicky, so I pulled over. I waited 10 minutes because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anaphylaxis or not. I felt OK after 10 minutes, so I drove to nearest ER and waited in parking lot several hours then drove home. I probably should have administered epinephrine and called 911 when I had that reaction. Continued with 25mg Benadryl every 4 hours and nightly Xyzal 5mg. The next morning (24 hours later)  I woke up scratching my face. I had a diffuse sandpaper rash all over my head and neck and was very itchy. Doubled my dose of Benadryl to 50mg every 4 hours. Also took 400mg of quercetin. The itching resolved and the rash was gone the next day, which was 48 hours after vaccine. I was fatigued for several days but fatigue is my baseline as a narcoleptic plus I was taking benadryl. I continued the Benadryl for a total of 4 days. I normally do not develop rashes unless I rub against hay and I did not have any contact with hay.

                                                1 week after covid shot on 1/18/21,  I missed a day of work for stiff neck followed by a headache. Over the next 3 weeks, my headache increased in nature, and accompanied with stiff neck, stiff hips and I could only lay on my back to sleep. The headache was mainly on my right side behind my eye.  I tried a high dose of naproxen, as well as massage, chiropractic and got no relief.  Finally on  February 2nd,  I went to the urgent care associated with my primary care provider because my primary care provider was not available.

Shortness of breath and dizziness accompanied premature ventricular contractions from 2/6/21 around 6:00am through to 2/6/21 around 7:00pm. Severity was never such that I felt I needed to vagal. But symptoms were the most they had ever been.

                                                Day 1: 7 hours after the vaccine shot, I experienced mild fatigue and chills. Overnight, I had night sweats and insomnia. (Night sweats are a symptom that started after the first vaccine shot, and had dwindled until the second brought them up again).   Day 2: The next morning, I experienced intense fatigue, dizziness, chills, fever, headache with light and sound sensitivity, nausea, and intense fatigue. I was unable to get out of bed most of the day. I could not sit up without intense effort to even drink water. At approximately 11am, I took 600mg Tylenol, then was able to sleep for 3 hours. When I woke up my symptoms were much better, though I still had mild fatigue and achiness.   Day 3:  I was mildly fatigued but otherwise felt good.   Day 4: I awoke with a series of small rashes on my torso (front, back, and sides), as well as my inner arm. They were red, flat, not raised, and mildly itchy, One was around my umbilicus, a few under my breasts, and other splotched in random other places on my torso. My inner ears were also mildly itchy. I put generic rash cream on the rashes on my torso and arms, and the itchiness subsided. The redness decreased throughout the day, though they were all still visible by evening.    Day 5: I awoke and my entire torso was bright red *except* the places where the rashes had been the day before, which were normal skin color. Ears are itchy again, and skin is very mildly itchy. Other than that, no other symptoms. No trouble breathing, good energy.   I have never had rashes or an allergic reaction like this before. I assume it&#39;s an allergic reaction, due to the itchy inner ears and skin.

                                                I had a very, very, sore arm again. This is day 3 and its better but my arm has hurt so badly its been hard to use the last couple days. Day 1; I felt the same as I did after dose 1, fatigue and kind of light headed and dizzy. Woke up yesterday feeling the same and thought it was maybe lack of sleep because I kept rolling onto my left arm. But then the fever kicked in and I had the chills for about 2 hours. I couldn&#39;t seem to get warm. I had a pounding headache all day that Tylenol and Motrin wouldn&#39;t take away. I was very fatigued all day. Later in the day I became very hot and could not seem to cool off. I also had a sore throat and my body was slightly achy but that could of been from not sleeping well or sleeping weird due to my arm hurting. I woke up this morning with just being tired and my arm is still sore but even that is feeling much better. I didn&#39;t even feel the need to take pain reliever for that like I had been since I got my vaccine.

Upon sitting down, sudden onset of extreme chills, to the point of shaking so terribly that my muscles hurt.  I sat with 4 or 5 blankets on me and tried to rest until the shaking subsided.  I asked a family member to sit and monitor me, as I was unable to do anything due to the shaking.  This lasted approximately 2.5 hours, then stopped, leaving my muscles feeling sore and overworked. It was exhausting.

Pt denies heart disease, strokes, diabetes, increased bleeding tendency. No early heart disease in family. LMP in the last week. Pt notes she was supposed to see allergist in past, but has not. Pt was feeling well this morning before she came to COVID vaccine clinic. Pt had received first Moderna Vaccine shortly before 0918am here. At 0938 Pt noted feeling &#34;heaviness&#34; in head and &#34;lump in throat.&#34; Pt denied itching/swelling to mouth, itching/hives to body, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea. No lightheadedness/dizziness. Pt walked to stretcher. BP at right forearm was 223/151 and then 221/132 on repeat. Heartrate in 90s. Sao2 on RA 100%. RR 18. Pt notes having high BPs at times, but not often as high here. Pt speaking is slightly hoarse voice. No strider. Pt speaking in full sentences. No oropharyngeal edema. No urticaria. No tachypnea or wheeze. HRT RRR. 2&#43; left rad pulse.  A/P: given Pt&#39;s h/o severe allergies and now new Globus sensation and change to voice I discussed with Pt that she was likely having allergic reaction. Given involvement of airway I recommended epi administration to neutralize reaction and transfer to ED for observation. I advised Pt that epi would increase heartrate and blood pressure. I determined benefit of treating anaphylaxis outweighed risk of elevating BP, even though she has hypertensive urgency BP values. Pt has some headache; she could be bordering on hypertensive emergency. I asked pharmacist to call 911 indicating early anaphylaxis and request of paramedic.  ~5 minutes after Epi (given at 0942) Pt notes lump sensation and voice improved. I had RN place IV to left AC and gave verbal order for benadryl 25mg IV. Pt notes some nausea and dizziness. Lump sensation continues to improve. EMS arrived ~0950. I gave report to paramedic.  I discussed with Pt that I would place referral to Allergy and Immunology; they will determine if and when Pt could receive second moderna vaccine.

Fifteen (15) minutes after vaccination (18:00) and thus during the observation period, the patient experienced a skin rash in her face and chest and felt light headed. The Paramedic on-site confirmed the presence of a skin rash from the facial area down to the chest. Immediately, the paramedic assisted the patient by placing her in a semi-fowler&#39;s position on a medical cot. Thereafter the Paramedic proceeded to clinically assess the patient, who was alert, oriented and with patent airway. Patient&#39;s HEENT intact (continued below).

I was talking in my sleep a lot which is something that I never do. The next morning severe migraine, nausea, my spine hurt, extreme fatigue, only spine was sore but it felt very hard to move my body - like I was moving in slow motion. I was back to having trouble forming sentences and finding correct words. These symptoms were far more severe than my actual COVID symptoms when I was sick with that. I had no appetite. That lasted all day. Tylenol - took that and did go to work to see two patients but should have stayed home. When I woke up the next morning (third day after the vaccine) I felt fine except for lingering fatigue. The fatigue was gone by the afternoon on Friday (the 29th).

                                                Evening of 2nd approximately 6pm diarrhea began with increasing frequency throughout the night. Lasted through the night several times an hour into the next morning.  Around midnight dizziness,, faint and muscle weakness set in with feeling of extreme pressure on neck, especially right side where shot administered. Arms became tingly, tongue became tingly, hard to keep awake.  After 12 hrs of extreme diarrhea, passed out for 12hrs straight. Awoke dehydrated, extreme muscle weakness unable to walk or stand, light headed, nauseous, dizzy, unable to grip or exert force. Felt like head was detached from body due to extreme pressure on neck. Rapid resting heart rate in 90s (usual testing HR in 50s).   Constant rolling waves of abdominal cramps brought dizziness with each cramp, acid reflux, bloating and gas.  These symptoms lasted through the evening of the 3rd into the 4th. Considered going to ER for help, as extreme dizziness and muscle weakness prevented walking. Fell asleep.  6am March 4th developed fever of 101. Continued extreme dizziness, pressure on neck, muscle weakness and feeling faint and extreme lethargy throughout day.  Fever subsided to 99 by evening of 4th.  Ate plain rice evening of 4th, 1st time eating in over 48hrs. Immediately passed out.  Match 5th still feeling weak, hard to stand, limited walking. Diarrhea has subsided, less pressure on neck and less dizziness. Feeling exhausted overall. Fall asleep easily and randomly.

It was very mild (I had a much worse one with my mri contrast) but she wanted to keep an eye on me and said my 15 minutes  wasn?t up for seven minutes . She stayed with me and very close by. I cannot say enough good things about her. Everyone at this facility were great!  I felt fine and told her that. I was not itchy. At the end of my 15 minutes she said I could pull to the side because I asked to use the restroom and wanted to see if I had it anywhere else. It was already looking better and I notice it also on my right upper leg. I had  a thicker diarrhea without stomach cramps or anything.  I didn?t feel bad or great but just wanted to go home. She asked if I wanted to see someone inside and I declined and she suggested I follow up with my healthcare doctor after making sure I was okay. I took a Claritin I had on me before leaving. My mouth got extremely dry and I drank a large water. If I didn?t not my throat kind of had a mild burn to it and cottonmouth.  I didn?t feel bad but I didn?t feel as good as I did going into the first shot. After arriving home an hour and a half later it would come in waves of not feeling great and then feeling okay. I was very worn out and felt had I not tried to push though it would help. I took a Benadryl at 3 am and Advil . Day two just normal side effects. Fatigue headache nausea which I used  zofran and Advil. My skin feels itching from time to time but no rash. Injection site clear with mild soreness.  My left ear keeps feeling like pressure off and on. Nothing severe to me. .

                                                3/8/21 - received #1 Moderna vaccine in upper left arm.  It immediately caused intense pain throughout my upper arm.  By 5:30 pm, my arm felt like I was carrying a 15 pound dumbell in it.  I could barely move my arm.   3/9/21 - immediately noticed the whole upper arm was swollen with a lump.  I felt very fatigued throughout my whole body and my legs felt very heavy (could not go to work) 3/10/21 - very fatigued and my legs continued to feel heavy and lethargic.  I went to work but could not dance and sing like I typically do in class with my students.  I also noticed I could not lift up my left arm.  I also felt like my brain was very foggy.  I felt that I could have fallen asleep while driving to work and while driving home from work.  That evening I fell asleep at 7:00 pm standing up, leaning on a counter while waiting for my son to brush his teeth.  I have NEVER fallen asleep standing up in my life.  I had to go to bed at 7:30 pm due to extreme exhaustion. 3/11/21 - very fatigued and extreme leg pain.  My calves feel like there are knots twisting inside of them and as if they might explode from the inside out.  Still could not lift my arm high for more than a few seconds.  Could not sleep that night due to the severity of the leg pain. 3/12/21 - very fatigued and extreme leg pain continued and pain in both arms down into my forearms.   My calves feel like there are knots twisting inside of them and as if they might explode from the inside out.  Still could not lift my arm high for more than a few seconds.  I went to bed at 6:30 pm (not normal for me) due to extreme exhaustion and pain throughout my body.    I laid in bed for hours crying in pain until I got up to take Advil PM and finally fell asleep sometime after 11:00 pm. 3/13/21 - had to cancel my weekly class at the gym due to continued fatigue, pain throughout both arms and legs.  Unable to lift my arm long enough to brush hair and do a ponytail for my daughter.  My forearms had so much pain at night.   3/14/21 - could not go to the gym due to continued fatigue and pain throughout my muscles.  I can&#39;t lift my left arm to use a hair dryer.  My left arm has severe pain if I try to even hold my macbook in my left arm. This is horrific.  I am miserable and cannot yet function normally.

                                                I did have significant side effects with the second vaccine (dizziness, fever, headache, fatigue).  However, I am writing because on March 8, 2021, 4 weeks after the 2nd vaccine, I began experiencing a sore throat.  My 2 year old tested positive for COVID that day due to exposure at day care.  My symptoms worsened to include head congestions, runny nose, headache, and some chest congestion and cough. On March 13 I tested positive for COVID 19 at a healthcare facility.  On March 15 my primary care provider asked me to reach out to you and also a local health facility (which I did, leaving a message with a member of the staff).

At some point in the middle of the morning, around 4 or 5am, I felt extremely feverish and lethargic. I was barely able to get out of the bed. The remainder of the day, my body felt so weak, as if I exercised for 4 hours the day before. I was sweating a lot and trying to maintain my body temperature the whole day. My temperature was 101.5 when I checked it at night. Around 1:30 am, I started feeling better. The next day, my body temperature was normal but I was still sweating more than usual. Today, I am feeling a little weak but much better than the past couple of days.

She reported dizziness and &#34;needing fresh air&#34;. She denied difficulty breathing, swelling, pain, nausea, numbness, tingling, or palpitations. She stated her only symptom was dizziness. She did not feel she was going to pass out. She did state &#34;this happens to me with vaccines&#34;. She was offered water and began to feel better within 5 minutes. She waited for a full 30 minutes after vaccine and reported that all symptoms had resolved.  Vitals at 01:10 were BP 118/80, Spo2 97, heart rate of 43 (up to 60 at 01:30).

I felt like crap afterwards and stayed the full 30 minutes too. I had thought maybe it was anxiety, but I&#39;ve broken out all over in hives and I can barely talk now due to how hoarse my throat is. I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!

I was still waiting for the nurse to replace her bandaid since she was bleeding a little more than normal. As soon as the car got out of the tent, I was driving, it felt like my head was being drilled, my vision blurred, everything turned dark, I could not hear, I had a bad headache almost about to faint but I kept on driving slowly to get to the waiting area. By the time I parked, I removed my mask, open the car window and relaxed and just started inhaling deeply.  I felt better soon after and spoke to the nurse there and she recommended drinking fluids the next 48 hrs.  I felt dizzy,  tired but not very sore like the first dose.  2 days later, I still feel dizzy, vision is blurry sometimes and occasional headache, a little tenderness on abdomen and feeling like I am catching my breath sometimes.

                                                Patient began experiencing pain and difficulty walking on Tuesday, March 23. Later that afternoon she was taken to an Urgent care, who sent her to the ER for evaluation. She was diagnosed with a very large blood clot in her leg, spanning from just above the knee to her groin area. They admitted her and began treating her with blood thinners.  While undergoing that treatment, her heart stopped 3 times and she had to be resuscitated. They discovered a pulmonary embolism.  While removing a large clot from her lungs, the doctor found that her lungs were riddled with hundreds of tiny blood clots. They also said that she was bleeding internally, very heavily, from an unknown location. In all, they gave her 20 units of blood, and none of it stayed in her veins. The doctor said it seemed to just disintegrate.  At that point, her brain and organs had begun shutting down and family made the decision to remove her from life support. She passed away Thursday evening, March 25, 2021.
