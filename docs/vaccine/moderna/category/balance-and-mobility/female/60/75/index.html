                                                Approximately 8 mins after injection, I began to experience lightheadedness and trouble focusing.  Began to feel dizzy, weak, was sweating, and had a flushed appearance in face.  On attempt to stand, felt like I could not take a step.  In ER vitals were normal except for blood pressure was high.  Was discharged after receiving IV fluids, lab tests, EKG.  About 5 hours later, I developed a low grade fever of 99.7, blood pressure 142/92, chills,  general malaise and body aches.  Symptoms started dissipating later in the evening.  Started feeling better as the day progressed the next day.

                                                I received the vaccination at 11:00 am and felt absolutely nothing at the time of the shot.  I was 100% fine until around 3:00 pm when I felt very light headed while sitting on the couch. I am a fainter and felt like i was going to faint.  I called my husband and with that I broke out in a very cold sweat and then fell asleep for 2 hours.  I was cold from sleeping in the cold sweat I believe but nothing after.

                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

My supervisor on my floor took my blood pressure and it was 164/122 and my pulse rate was 190. A PA was available and examined me and asked if I had caffeine which I didn?t. After sitting and being re-examined my blood pressure was 142/100, and my pulse was 90. I was sent home.

Today my arm is slightly sore and I still have a headache but it is not as severe as previous.

                                                I have been having left arm pain every since having the vaccine. I thought it would go away but the discomfort is now when I have Range of Motion upward and the discomfort is in my shoulder, arm area and a little below the injection site. I still am having that discomfort and in addition to that, that past 7 days I have been having neck and jaw pain like in the node areas front and back of my next. As well as my lower lip has has two episodes of swelling but it goes down and then it feels ok. I generally overall just don?t feel well.  Eye and head pain as well.  I thought it was best that this be reported cause I just don?t know what is going on. I have made an appointment with my doctor which is on Feb 5.

Few minutes later, patient was feeling little better but then started again, hence stayed back for an hour in the same place. On 19-Jan-2021 (today) her arm was still hurt pretty much and had a node in her back arm. Patient also stated that vaccine was not administered in her muscle instead injection was provided sub-cutaneous.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.

I am monitoring it daily and it has not been below 147/92 and as high as 163/97. I have never had a problem with my blood pressure before.

                                                I had a sore arm on Sunday night - and Monday it was really sore and couldn&#39;t use my arm at all so I called in sick. Got sick on Tuesday, the January 5th - woke up with a sore throat; hoarse throat; fever; chills; cough - and chest was congested.  Fever came and went. A bit of muscle aches in my chest from coughing so much. I called the DR and they sent me down to the COVID area of my doctor&#39;s office. They did COVID test and told me to go home. On Thursday, they reported that I was negative on my test. I called my Dr  and she told me she had to still be quarantined for 10-14 days. She told me to take my asthma medicine and she told me to take cough medicine (OTC) and take Tylenol if I still need something else. She told me to drink fluids and rest. I went back to work on January 19th, Tuesday. I still have a little bit of congestion and cough.  I had the second dose of the Moderna on January 28th. I had  a sore arm but not as bad as last time.

I also experienced jaw pain and I went to the dentist where an x-ray was done, which was negative. I was also put on antibiotics due to a suspected middle ear infection. I felt like I had a spiral headache.  I saw my PCP, nurse practitioner who gave me a steroid injection which helped. I have cancelled my second dose injection. I have been sick for 4 weeks. I still have the jaw pain with a ringing sensation to my left ear.  Tomorrow I will go get more tests done. I am also having swollen neck with lymph nodes swollen.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

Nothing so far has stopped the vertigo.

                                                Approx 30 minutes after my 1st Moderna vaccination,  I noticed that I was having difficulty swallowing water.  I soon began to not feel very well.  Sort of light headed.  My heart was racing.  When I looked at my watch it recorded my heart rate at 160 beats per minute!!  I started taking deep breaths and a technique called EFT tapping to calm me down.  Eventually it worked, but I felt extreme tiredness after that.  When I woke up in the morning my entire face was swollen.  I also noticed on the 2nd day after vaccine shot I had dark purple circles under my eyes.  None of those things have ever happened to me before in my life.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

                                                The injection was very painful and pain persisted for 1 day at similar intensity at the very top of the arm near the shoulder.  The joint was painful but the muscle was worse.  I could not even lift my arm without moderate to severe pain. That pain faded, but my clavicle area on the left side began hurting on day 3 and feeling along the bone I discovered a painful lump.  It is on top of the bone about 1 3/4 inches from the notch at the base of the throat. Overnight the lump got less swollen but harder.  It is oval, and depending on my position ranges from the size of a green grape to the size of a kumquat.

She said that she felt that if she had to stand up that she would fall over. patient has felt this prior when she over took her seizure medication or when she takes her medication early in the morning. We gave the patient orange juice and water. We checked her blood pressure, oxygen, and heart rate. Patient then stated her throat felt like it was getting tight. We then gave the patient 25 mg of chewable benadryl. Patient did not have difficulty breathing. Patient was monitored for over an hour after vaccine administration

At about 8:00 AM on the morning following the injection, I had chills with intense muscle spasms.  At about 9:00 AM, I developed a headache (and I am not at all prone to headaches).  I was also extremely thirsty.  By 9:30 I developed a fever which lasted all day.  I was teaching and had no access to Tylenol, so I taught through it.  My temp ranged from 99.8 to 103.8.  I also felt weak and woozy.  When I got home,  took two extra strength Tylenol and rested.  I had a few bouts of chills and loose stools.  I went to bed at 10:00 PM, slept well, and woke with no adverse symptoms at all, other than a sore arm.  I was very surprised by these physical side effects as this was the first time I have had adverse effects from any medication.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

However, on March 1st I was dizzy in the morning and it took 45 minutes to pass. March 2 I was even dizzier in the morning and March 3rd was even worse with dizziness, I had to lie back down after getting ready for work.  Each day thereafter, the dizziness was less, but I am still experiencing an uncomfortable level of dizziness.  It is especially noticeable when I put my head back to drink water, or shampoo/rinse my hair or while trying to do usual morning exercises or scrolling on computer.  I feel like since the extreme dizzy episode on 2/20 that my equilibrium is affected, hopefully not permanently.  I have no other symptoms.  If this does not improve, I will go to my doctor.

                                                On Friday, March 12th, 2021 approximately 10:35 am, 60-year-old female received her first dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot Number: 003A21A) in her left deltoid at the facility.  Patient received the Moderna Vaccine. After which she sat in the designated medical observation area for her allotted 15 minutes. Approximately nine minutes post-injection around 10:44 am, she felt a bit ?wobbly? when standing up. A medical assistant called Emergency Medical Services (EMS) immediately and the Physicians Assistant went over to assess patient&#39;s symptoms.   During the wait time for EMS?s arrival, the physicians assistant performed an assessment. Patient states to have experienced lightheaded-ness, mouth/tongue tingling, shortness of breath and palpitations. She denied throat constriction, denied itching, redness or pain at the site of injection. She said the tingling she did experience resolved around 20 mins post-injection.   During the assessment, the physicians assistant noted clear breath sounds, irregular health rhythm, increased heart rate, extra-ocular movements intact with no nystagmus, no redness or swelling on the injection site and good grip strength.   Upon EMS arrival at approximately 10:48 pm, the firefighters triaged as per their assessment. She expressed that she is taking ?Lexapro? and allergic to sulfa-drugs. She claims to be ?borderline diabetic? and that the lightheaded-ness has ?never happened before?  The EMS took her to a separate room in the building and assessed her further. After approximately 20 minutes she left and did not leave in an ambulance against medical advice.  She left with her husband and went home. She was made aware that she should go to the hospital immediately if she felt her health was compromised.

                                                Gave a patient a Moderna vaccine today. ( 03/15/2021)  Patient stated before I gave then vaccine to her that she had felt dizzy after receiving her flu vaccination previously.  Patient became dizzy and lightheaded after I gave her the Moderna (10:40am). Patient was concerned that her blood sugar was low and took a glucose gel packet from her purse.  She stated that she thought she might faint, so moved the patient to the floor with her feet elevated.  I took the patient&#39;s blood sugar, it was 211. I monitored her pulse, it was strong and not racing. Placed a cool wet rag on the patient&#39;s forehead. Patient remained lying down for 10 minutes and said she was feeling better and asked to sit up.  I assited her in sitting up on the floor. Had her sit on floor for 5 minutes more before helping her to a chair.  Continued to monitor patient for an additional 10 minutes.  She stated she felt better and had her companion escort her to his car and drove home.  Followed up with patient an hour later, she stated that she felt much better and had eaten lunch and was taking it easy.  She thanked us for assisting her. I will follow up with her tomorrow.

                                                My arm immediately swelled up at injection site probably a little smaller than a golf ball. Applied ice pack immediately. After about 15 minutes I became lightheaded, nauseous and severely diaphoretic, lasted about 45 minutes. I was laid down on a mat snd monitored by several nurses. Taking my blood pressure, monitoring my oxygen and heart rate. Applied ice packs to neck and forehead. I felt better when I left but kind of out of it and fatigued for a few days. The healthcare professionals were great!

Occurred approximately 15 minutes after immunization.  Called 911 and paramedics evaluated her before taking her to the ER where she was released.  Previously stated she was extremely nervous about receiving the vaccine.

                                                Pt was doing fine after receiving the vaccine.  That following day, she reported having flu-like symptoms.  She had covid-19 about 9 months prior and knew that she may have more severe symptoms.  Later that day, she reported having shortness of breath and could not talk without taking breaks in-between.  She also had a difficult time walking.  Pt was seen and treated in the emergency department.  I feel this was more patient issues since she has had a history rather than direct effect of the vaccine.

                                                I felt slightly dizzy within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine, but shrugged it off as unimportant.  I developed a slight headache within an hour of the vaccine.  I continued to feel a bit dizzy and confused the rest of the day but didn&#39;t take anything for the slight headache.  When I awoke this morning, I had a bad headache, chills, body aches all over, dizziness, light-headedness and confusion.  I was so confused that I didn&#39;t remember making coffee for my son.  I&#39;ve also had difficulty concentrating or keeping on task.  I took less than half of a Benadryl tablet about 45 to 60 minutes ago in case my body was experiencing an allergic reaction.  Hopefully the dizziness and confusion will subside soon.

                                                Within two hours I felt heat in the left arm and head twice, then four hours later I had pinching in the left side abdomen colon area, Eight hours later I felt pinching in the chest area and repeated pinching in the colon area. Later towards evening I felt a slight headache and then stiffness in the left neck area. Fifteen hours later I felt intense pain in the right hip and towards the buttock region, including right leg pain for about six hours. It was very difficult to walk when the pain came on.I got the sniffles on and off that day. I experienced leg stiffness in both legs for over two weeks and it was painful to walk during this time. It was like an artherosclerotic event in that everything  stiffened up and my legs felt like logs. I started to get on and off pain in the upper inner thigh region, which felt like nerve pain. This nerve pain was often felt in both legs as well. My daily walk became very difficult to do. The second week I began to have a vein pulsate in my right forearm and a tic developed in that area. This went on for three days. By the third week I started experiencing daily headaches.  My blood pressure increased in the third week to about 167/90 up from 136/80. Up until today, March 17 I still have mild headaches on and off, and some mild inner thigh nerve pain, and minimal stiffness and mild pain in both of my legs. I am very concerned about receiving the second dose and have contacted two of my physicians.

                                                Patient reports adverse effects started approximately 8 pm on 3/18/2021, She experienced significant known adverse effects of the vaccine (reported severe fatigue, chills, pain in arm in which vaccine was administered) but also reports she was having great difficulty moving her neck. She reports that she was able to work (as a hair stylist) on 3/19 with more mild symptoms but still did not feel well and was still having difficulty moving her neck. She reported that she only realized on the afternoon of 3/20 that she had developed swelling at the base of her neck where it met her collarbone. She reported the swollen area was the size of a baseball and was red and warm. She indicated it was on the same side of her body as the vaccination site. She had not yet sought medical treatment when she contacted us but was going to have it examined. She called to notify the pharmacy so that we could report her condition but was not present at the pharmacy on 3/20.  Below item 21 is a required field and since she had not yet sought medical care but intended to this weekend I selected emergency room/department or urgent care.

Staff immediately responded. She was able talk but shaking. BP and HR elevated initially. Assisted to wheelchair after monitoring. Vitals returned to normal range, client no longer shaking and speech clear.

Coincidentally, it seemed to help with headache and dizziness.  Still taking meloxican and headache and dizziness are minimal, but still present.  Will be getting off the meloxican on Friday, 3/26, and we&#39;ll see???  3/ 20 - started with fever blisters and mouth ulcers(probably from shot or stress  all this has brought on my body)

                                                Patient was observed, to tilt head back like going to pass out, then slumped forward in chair, extremities convulsed and patient came to.   She reported feeling dizziness, chills, nausea and tingling in both hands.  I asked her if would like us to call EMS but refused medical attention.  She knew date and location when asked.  We offered to have family member pick her up but refused.

I do have anxiety but I have never experienced this with my anxiety nor was I feeling anxious at the time.  It last about a minute and left, I did not experience any other reactions at the time of vaccination.   Wondering if this is normal or should I get my next vaccine in a more medical type setting?

I laid on the floor for about 15min they symptoms got somewhat better enough to sit up.  I was sent home by my boss who also offered me a ride because I looked so awful. At home I went to bed but continued to throw up and have chills.  I slept the rest of the next 2 days.  I have continued to not feel well since the body aches and nausea  as well as short of breath being the worst at this point.   I felt in the beginning I was going to die it was so bad.  I&#39;m not one to just go to the doctors so I went home to bed.  I have been short of breath

                                                Sore arm right away - that evening I could hardly move my arm. When I woke up the next morning, I had all of the symptoms that I had when I had the virus and I had 100.5 fever - headache; tired; achy. And those lasted not even a whole day and then they went away. Then the next night after that I couldn&#39;t sleep on the arm it hurt so bad. And the next day I noticed a rash - in the area around the shot on the top part of the left  arm and it was burning and hot  and it itched real bad. I took Benadryl. I went to the doctor (on the 18th or 19th - went for other reasons and I also showed her my arm) and she gave me some prednisone but I didn&#39;t take all of it because it started going away. I only took a day of the prednisone and day 6 it seemed to be going away.  I have photos of it. My symptoms had resolved by second dose. 2/12/2021 - I had a headache for a day after the second dose but that was it.

                                                My first dose simply resulted in a sore arm.  The second dose gave me an extremely sore arm...at 3 pm I couldn&#39;t lift a small glass of water to take ibuprofen.  It hurt over my entire shoulder, up my neck and down my arm.  I had no appetite , eating made me queasy and I went to bed at 10.  I woke up a little after midnight in terrible pain:  excruciating headache, all my lymph nodes hurt (both arms, groin, thighs), body aches all over.  I was chilling, but I was in too much pain to shiver, and had horrible nausea --?from the pain??.   I managed to get more  blankets and fell back asleep.  I woke again at 4 am in even more pain and nausea, and a fever of 102.6.  (My baseline body temp is usually around 96.5.  I rarely get fever that high). The pain was so bad I wanted to chop my head and arm off.  I got a cold wet washcloth for my head, put on lighter weight clothing ( it took a lot of effort to do anything  with the pain.  I was dizzy and stumbling).  And was able to fall back asleep for a few hours.  Fever started coming down around 9am, so I tried drinking water.  Slowly improved as the day progressed

                                                She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.  Then her arm started hurting to the point that she could not move it.  On Thursday, 3/25/21 she was tired but functional.  Then around 5:30 PM she started feeling really strange, odd, felt faint, got hot/cold, her heart was racing.  She laid down as she was at a friends house, they checked her BP, blood sugar and her temperature and they were all normal at that point.  Around 8:00 PM she got the nausea that would not stop and took Zofran.  Around 9:30 she started throwing up.  She then tried Phenergan and was not able to keep that down yesterday.  Then she started running a temperature, and called her doctors office and told her what to look for and to call back if things got worse.  They then got worse, called them back and then around 8:00 AM on Friday they told her to go to the hospital.  When she got to the hospital they started checking things as her fever was higher, her liver enzymes, her thyroid, her kidneys, iron just started going off the page.  Her fever then kept getting higher and higher and at one point it was documented at 104.8, and felt like her organs hurt.  11 days prior to this visit she had just had labs done and everything was normal.  So due to the new findings everything was all elevated, so they checked her for an infection, COVID which was negative, but the intensity of the symptoms got to the point they were unbearable.  She stayed in the hospital for 4 days, and the doctor came in and noted that she had a severe reaction to the vaccine.    They told her to stay longer than the 15 minutes as they had some issues today, and told her that they had to call a medic for 4 other people that passed out, which made her wonder if they had a bad batch or not, and wonders how many people from that day got sick as well.     She still has the most dreadful fatigue, headache and cannot walk from her house to the mailbox without feeling like she is going to faint and used to walking 2-4 miles daily.  Wonders how long is this going to last and that this will pass and that she will be okay, or is she going to be permanently this way.  She feels like she has a bad case of mono or something and cannot stay up and has to go to bed, and also has bouts of insomnia as well.   The body aches are extreme and is taking pain medicine daily due to these symptoms, which she did not have prior to the vaccine.   She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.

                                                I recently retired after 37 years and now stay and provide significant weekly care for my elderly parents.  Because I am a primary caregiver for my parents, and have been throughout the months of the pandemic, I explored various potential paths to ethically and appropriately get in line for a vaccination.  When I took my mother in for her second vaccination at the Health Department in late in March I was able, while my mother was waiting, to converse with a county public health care worker about options and avenues for me to obtain the vaccine as well. She could see, clearly, that I was a caregiver for my mother, so she took down my name and number, and she called me the next day to say that I could, as a caregiver, proceed to sign up for their next clinic vaccination day that would be happening on Thursday, April 1st.   I arrived for my noon vaccination time at the Health Department before 12 on Thursday, April 1st. I proceeded through the check in line and screening questions, and arrived at vaccination site #1 at 12:05 where I was promptly given the Moderna vaccine (lot #026B21A).  Within seconds of the injection, I knew that I was having a reaction. My heart immediately began pounding, my tongue swelled and the room disintegrated into swirling flashes of color. I looked into the kind eyes of my vaccinator and remember distinctly saying to her in those first few post-injection seconds that, I was, ??sorry, but I think that I am having a reaction.?  The vaccinator then took me over to the nursing site coordinator who proceeded to check and record my vitals. I do not have that sheet with the vitals that she recorded, but I do remember that my heart rate and blood pressure measures were high. I sat as she continued to monitor me.  After 20-30 minutes, as best I can recall, my vitals were not improving, but remained elevated and even seemed to be trending higher. Also, the swelling and tingling in my tongue was worsening and seemed to be spreading to my lips and face, and down to the base of my neck.  I began to feel dizzy, like I was going to faint, so she had me lay on the floor with my legs elevated.  Additionally, it was becoming more difficult to breath because of the pressure in my neck. She had earlier and initially offered me Benadryl for the symptoms I was experiencing but I did not previously have good luck with Benadyrl the one time I took it, and also was unsure if I would have been able to swallow it. At 12:40 she thus gave me an injection of epinephrine (3mL) in my thigh and an ambulance was called. I was transported to the ER at the hospital. (Please note that the nursing site coordinator provided top-notch, high quality care through-out my entire emergency medical reaction experience, and I am very grateful and appreciative of her professional and caring response.)  In ER they monitored my blood pressure and pulse, and other aspects of my heart rhythm, as well as the swelling and tingling that continued in my tongue, lips, face and forehead.  I met with the Dr., and worked with RNs during my time there where they continued to monitor me for a number of hours. By about 4:30, when my vitals had returned to normal and stabilized for over an hour, they released me from the hospital. Since my release from the hospital, late in the afternoon on Thursday, April 1, I have noted only a few, relatively minor persisting symptoms which have included tongue, lip and face numbness and tingling. Also, I have noted, from time to time, some periods of continued heart rate elevation, though wonder if it is more of an almost ?PTSD? type of reaction than a pure physiological response, since, for example, just retelling this story right now is causing my heart rate to rise as I recall what happened.  Needless to say, this vaccination induced medical event, explained above, made for a surreal and frightening day unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Processing of it, and grappling with its implications, from concrete to existential, is seeming equally daunting, and it is here where I have a range of questions for which I am seeking assistance and perspective from the CDC:  The most concrete types of vaccination questions first: They indicated I should not try to obtain the second dose of the Moderna vaccine but that I should consult and maybe it could be given to me in a hospital setting? I welcome thoughts and feedback on how to proceed to become ?fully vaccinated.? What about another vaccine?  What about the additional boosters now being discussed for the new variants? Will I need to consider a ?cave dwelling? of some type for myself in the future since I will not have the vaccination card that is being discussed as ?the ticket to travel? in the future?  Will there be special cards for folks like me who tried but for whatever strange immunological reason was not able to take the vaccine? Increasingly complex, bigger picture questions next: Would any type of ?reach-out? to Moderna be in order? Or, do you, at the CDC, reach out to Moderna for me as a result of this VAER? Are they studying people like me?  My sense, from what little reading I have done, is that what happened to me, though severe, is rare, though definitely want the producers of the vaccine to know about my experience. Bordering on existential questions: What does this mean for me and my life going forward? Should I meet with Moderna, or some type of allergy specialist to better understand what may have happened, and what I will need to watch out for in the future? As everyone begins sharing vaccination cards and experiences, what should I say? I don?t want to scare others away from doing what is needed to save lives by sharing my experience, and don?t want to fuel the ?anti-vaxers.? What about the lingering disquiet and unease that something I sought to help and protect me seems like it might have/nearly killed me? The pandemic has already shaken and taken so much in so many of our lives.  Immunization seemed to promise to give back some of what the pandemic has taken, yet, feeling now that ?normal? is not only more distant but possibly will not be achievable for folks like me, rare though we seem to be?

It is hard to lift my left arm up and put it across my chest because that hurts. It hurts in my lymph nodes and my joints. I had to go the the ER on 12/31/20 because of this. they gave me a shot of Prednisoneand Hydroxyzihe that helped for a coupled of days and then I had to go back to the ER on 1/6/21 because of the same symptoms. They gave me Benadryl,prednisone and pepcid. I am still itching.

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

                                                started with metallic taste in mouth, progressed rapidly to clammy, light headed, elevated BP and HR. All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Happened when I moved my head from side to side. Well walking I had to hold on to something until it passed. Some headache. I do have headaches anyway so I&#39;m not sure if that was the cause. My concern is the dizziness and the lightheadedness and loss of control, not immediately following the vaccine but three days later. Not sure if the delay in side effects is normal.

                                                I took the shot at 6:00P.M. at 6:10P.M. I started feeling a pain running from the shot site down to the bend in my arm, then it radiated down my lower arm to my wrist. I kept feeling it and at 6:15P.M. I started feeling lightheaded and  had the sensation I was going to faint. I notified the attendant and she and some other nurses came to my assistance and lowered me to the floor and raised my legs above my head.  They took my blood pressure and it was low as was my pulse, but my oxygen was 100%. i kept deep breathing as per their request. After a little bit i started to come to my senses and they gave me water.  I was difficult to swallow, my throat felt unusual. After about five minutes my swallowing got back to normal. The pain was still radiating from the shot site to my wrist. I stayed there till 6:50P.M. I felt better but on my way home the pain was still going down my arm.  About 8:00P.M. my left upper hand stated to hurt, then my thumb, index and middle fingers stated tingling.  That happened on and off through the evening.  At 12:00A.M i went to bed. On and off through the night I still had the pain and tingling in my arm and hand.  About 3:00A.M. I woke up and my arm and ring finger and little finger were numb like they fell asleep.  I raised my arm and the feeling slowly went away.  Throughout the day an 01/21/21 my arm was very sore by the injection site. Other than that nothing else has since occurred.

Mild chills and malaise started around 6:00PM. Headache continued throughout evening and woke me up at 4:00AM. Runny nose at that time also. Pain was relieved with an OTC sinus medication. Headache stopped around 11:00AM on 1/23. as did injection site pain. Sinus med (Advil sinus) worked on the headache.

Had a fever of 101 degrees.  As the hours passed, the joint pain spread to both hips  and ankles. Alternated Motrin and Tylenol with fever reduced to 100 degrees. All muscle aches, joint pain and chills continued for the next 2 days. Finally by day 3 the fever was down to 99.  Experienced fatigue, followed by severe vertigo by day 3.  Although muscle aches and joint pain slowly decreased over time, the vertigo has persisted and at times is accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

                                                IM vaccination was  given in LUE deltoid. On the day of the vaccine felt slightly dizzy and more fatigued. The following day, I developed a painful, enlarged lymph node in left supraclavicular area. The next day I felt overall weakness and tiredness. No fever noted, but I was frequently flushed and had hot flashes with perceived sudden weakness. I had slight nasal congestion and prolonged sneezing spells on the following days. I had to find a place to sit down and remove my lab coat and turn down the heat because of hot flashes at work. I had fecal urgency and loose stool x 2 on 3/5/21. I have mild lymph node enlargement in left neck today (2/6/21) that is not painful. I had pain at the injections site for 2-3 days after the first vaccine injection that awakened me from sleep a couple of times. The second injection was given in the same arm. All of my symptoms are easily managed with Tylenol, Motrin, fluids and rest.

Diarrhea and staved off vomiting. Could not eat most of the day until evening. Drank tons of fluids and Gatorade. Slept most of the day. Woke at 2am the morning of Feb 6th with continued muscle ache. Took more Tylenol. 9:15am as I write, I am feeling better, just exhausted.

According to my Watch app., the resting hear rate upon waking was 115.. I had a severe headache and generally felt awful. I took Aleve and did deep breathing to try to bring heart rate down. One hour later it was coming down, although still higher than my normal resting rate of 60.  The arm where the injection was given has been extremely sore with a rash, sore enough that it is hard to use the arm. It is now 3 days since the vaccine, my heart rate has been normal. My arm pain is reduced but still sore with a rash. I feel fatigued and foggy. The severe joint pain is less but still present.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the Moderna vaccine, I experienced an odd sensation in my stomach increased breathing, HR, lightheadedness, and dizziness. (I  experienced a similar reaction years ago but more severe, after having a breast MRI   with Gadolinium . I will consult my primary physician by email today. Per consult with a family physician, the recommendation has been advised for possible prophylactic treatment prior to obtaining the second Moderna vaccine. On rereading the composition of the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, I noted that polyethylene glycol(PEG) is a component in both the Pzifer and Moderna vaccines. I also discovered that PEG is also used with Gadolinium particles in contrast dye. Gadolinium-containing copolymeric chelates. A new potential MR contrast agent. Solvothermal synthesis and functionalization of polyethylene glycol.  It leads me to consider whether contrast dye should now be listed as one of the allergens on the vaccination registration forms, in order for persons with this allergy to report this information to their primary physicians prior to obtaining this vaccine.

Cold on and off, cold feet throughout the day. 5:30pm got home from work had shaking chills, unable to get warm for 2 hours. Finally got warm but it was a hot warmth. No fever. Took Tylenol 500mg. The warmth continued and had mild headache. Took 500mg Tylenol at bedtime 11pm. I was hot throughout the night ( no sweats ) woke at 6am feeling light headed and dizzy, body aches, still hot. Felt like I had the flu. I went into the bathroom to void. I remember thinking  - I am too sick to go to work.  My husband said I was standing holding onto the door, white in color, said &#34;i&#39;m sick&#34; he came to stand beside me to help me walk and I passed out. I had loss of consciousness. I do not know how long - he said he tried to shake me to wake me up about 30 seconds. He yelled to my son sleeping upstairs a few times, they got the phone and called 911. He said I vomited a few times and would not wake up.  I remember coming to - sitting on the floor with him talking to 911 .  I woke up enough to get up and walk to the living room couch with assist and gradually starting feeling better. The paramedics came and took my vital signs. Blood pressure (120/69 ), heart rate (84) oxygen saturations were all good. Blood glucose 116.  I declined ER transport.  I had continued light headedness, dizziness 2/6, 2/7/21.  Arm soreness gone at injection site on 2/7/21. I believe the dizziness is a mild concussion. I have a provider appointment 2/9/21.

                                                10 minutes after receiving vaccine I had sudden sharp pains in my right ear.  I have had extensive surgery in and around that ear due to cholesteatoma and perilymph fistula, and I have had some nerve damage to the balance nerve.  The bones of hearing have been removed and replaced with titanium artificial bones that do not work, so I am deaf in that ear.  These pains were severe, as if a number of steak knives were stabbing me at once, but the pain only lasted about a minute and subsided.  3 or 4 minutes later the pain recurred exactly as before but lasted a shorter duration and at a lower level of pain.  The ear felt congested the rest of the day and I avoided driving after getting home.  I have had no further problems, except that I went for more dental work on 2/8, and had a dizzy spell after getting anesthetic, maybe a little heart racing for just 5 minutes or so.

She passed out and fell to floor. Lost her pulse and ED staff began CPR. She got her pulse back and woke up and said I am okay. Doctor seeing her ordered labs, EKG, Echocardiogram , chest xray, cardiac enzymes. All tests were normal. ED doctor told patient the only thing they could contribute this to was her covid vaccine she got the day before. She was admitted to the facility for further observation for the next 24 hours.

That night my temperature rose to 100-100.7;  By morning 2 days after the dose the fever was gone, as was the tingling and dizziness; but the headache remains.   Excedrin XS and drinking a lot of water helped to relieve some of the symptoms. There&#39;s still some pain at injection site, but I expected that.

Increasing fatigue which maxed around 11am accompanied by  cold shivers and increased body temp . Fever picked at 5pm to 101.3F.  By 10pm fever and fatigue were gone! Day 2 after the vaccination: a red rash size 2 inch x 3 inch on the arm around the place of the injection, pain in the arm was nearly gone, no fever, no fatigue. Day 3 after the vaccination: red rash is gone. Back to normal.

                                                After 45 minutes of receiving vaccination , the knuckles in my left hand, the arm I received the shot in, began to hurt very badly.  Before I was able to get home,  7 minutes away, both hands hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t hole the steering wheel and I was having cramps in my legs.  I could hardly walk up the steps to my house because my ankle joints hurt so badly.  I went to bed  right away and slept .  My hands hurt really badly, but I knew the vaccination caused an inflammatory response so I figured just  rest.  By the end of the day Tuesday, I couldn&#39;t type and could not hold the steering wheel to drive home.  I felt out of breath, I hurt all over, my muscles ached and were cramping.  I was nauseated, very emotional.  I had a fever that spiked at over 101 degrees.  I was so chilled that I was shaking violently. I hurt in every joint, my lymph nodes were painfully swollen, my heart was racing, normal pulse for me is 68 to 72, it was 88 to 90.  Halfway up our stairs, I just stopped, couldn&#39;t make my legs work.  Day 3 I called my doctor, had a virtual appointment I knew I couldn&#39;t drive or ride 45 minutes away.  I missed 3 days of work, stayed home all weekend and was better by Monday.  It was 3 weeks before my hands quit aching.  The pain came and went in my ankles, wrist, knuckles, hips and knees.    Food still nauseates me.

                                                Within several hours my arm began getting really sore and I became extremely tired. I laid down for a nap in the recliner. I awoke 2 hours later (around 9:30 p.m.) with the whole left side of my body temporarily paralyzed. The whole side felt heavy/sore like my arm - almost as if the vaccine had spread down my side. It really scared me because I initially couldn&#39;t move. I finally worked my way into a sitting position, then stood up and walked it off, then was fine. No more problems with it. Just today (2/27) I am starting to feel better as far as fatigue and soreness and nausea go. No more paralysis.

I had a sore throat for about 15 days; at about one week past this dose, my right shoulder froze &amp; the rotator joint was swollen &amp; incredibly painful to the touch.  I lost the use of my right arm entirely for about five days, then the swelling &amp; pain slowly subsided.  My eyes were burning &amp; my arm was weak but I made a full recovery about 18 days after this dose.  The last symptoms were severe headaches, accompanied by an inability to remain asleep.  I took Tylenol &amp; Tylenol PM to alleviate pain &amp; regain some sleep &amp; did report these symptoms to my doctor.

EMT arrived checked blood pressure with finger (she did not tell us first result when I was extremely weak and felt like was about to pass out and had blurred vision-husband said I was barely responsive and couldn&#39;t move to get up), EMT then said would take BP again and while putting on arm cuff I vomited 2 times. After vomiting I felt immediately somewhat better, EMT took blood pressure and she said it was normal. EMT took blood sugar and she said  it was normal All less than 15 minutes after shot. We then waited at EMT direction for another 15 minutes. We left the clinic and parked just outside till 10:30. I am now feeling better, just tired.

                                                After my 1st shot I developed a red itchy rash on my arm  and it was swollen, this lasted for 4 days.   After receiving my 2nd Moderna shot approximately 6 hours later I started having side effects.  They were a combination of chills, leg pains, leg and feet cramping, headaches, sore arm, nausea, dizziness, exhaustion, stomach pain.  I was unable to get out of bed for 2 days and the side effects lasted for 7 days that I was either in bed or on the couch, not the 24-48 hours that I was told I could expect.  I just called both my general physician and my GI doctor to alert them and they said to continue to treat the symptoms.

                                                I started developing a fever of 100.2 around  11:30pm on 2/3/21, 13 hours after receiving the vaccine.  My fever rose to 101.3 by the following morning. It started to drop to 100.2 again by 9:30pm  on 2/4/21 and was 99.5 by 10am 2/5/21. I had  a severe headache that started as gentle pressure about 2 hours after being vaccinated and escalated to feeling like my head was in a vice  through the morning of 2/5/21. I had severe hip and knee joint pain and muscle pain all of 2/4. I was unable to walk because it hurt badly to put weight on my joints. I had a stiff neck and couldn?t turn my head more than 45% in either direction. I slept no more than 20 mins that night due to the pain.  On 2/4 I developed nose bleeds and incontinence. Those symptoms went away by 2/5.  Dizziness and lightheadedness, fatigue and headache stayed with me for 2 weeks. I am still more tired than usual.

Later that evening My are was sore and I continued to be dizzy. By nighttime I felt achy and tired. About 6 hours after the shot a fever started and I took Tylenol. By 1am I had 101.3, the rigors and a headache and dizziness which I still have 4 days later. My fever ran for over 48 hours and would not respond to any  ibuprofen or Tylenol. My joint and muscle pain was severe, my balance was off. I could barely move my arm. Today I am now nauseous. I was not this sick when I had Covid. My fever would at least relent. I?ve lost time from work and my life. I have heart palpitations and my resting heart rate has gone up. Pressure feels strange behind my eyes. My legs are sore.   I called my doctor two days after my vaccine and she minimized my symptoms.

I had confusion, reporting? Epipen?  Tell anyone.  I was not aware of my surroundings otherwise during the episode. Afterwards, I was breathing ok? and went home.  I later called Moderna, and reported this issue. I called the pharmacist, and reported the problem. I called many other pharmacies, asking for advise - ranging from NO do not take the 2nd vaccine (matter of life/death) due to serious reaction to take it &amp; wait longer.

I took some Tylenol which seemed to help a bit with the headache. By about 10 pm, I was back to normal. The following day (2 days post-vaccine), I was still a bit low energy and had a headache. The vaccine site was only sore when touched.

I did not expect the side effects to be that extreme.

As the day went on, the flu like pain increased by 100%. Dizziness ensued, and I could not move my head without nausea and an intense knife-like pain on the right side of my neck. All previous mildly sore areas were now on fire. Then the sirens happened. I have mild ringing in my ears due to chemotherapy, but this was just like I was standing next to an ambulance, for 8 hours. It has been over a week, and I am still fatigued with body pain.

EMTs determined that I should go to the hospital for monitoring.  EMTs reported that my vital statistics were elevated.  While at hospital, I was administered a saline IV and was kept there until my vital signs reached normal levels.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

It did improve and by Wednesday 1/13 was almost resolved. It again started to have increased soreness and loss of range of motion over the weekend 1/16-1/17, and on Monday 1/18 I called my doctor. It again improved on Wednesday 1/20, but I kept my appointment and my doctor ordered an MRI.

                                                Started with itching and rash at injection site. Went away in 2 days. Next day palm of hands and soles of feet became very itchy. Then progressed to whole body itching. Unable to sleep for two nights. Went to urgent care next morning. Was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg. Itching went away that night and was able to sleep. Next day bilateral hands had numbness and tingling and general dizziness so stopped taking hydroxyzine. Went to family practitioner and was prescribed methylprednisolone dose pack. After starting steroids, by 2nd day (today - 1-21-21), hands continued n/t. Bilateral feet developed n/t. Dizziness continues when standing but goes away when sitting. Balance and gait are unsteady. Difficulty walking from weakness, balance issues, and dizziness.

I ate some cereal and I got nauseated and I kept getting some chills. I went back to the office to do some paperwork and when I tried to walk it hurt. I told my coworker told me to get get something warm on my stomach, I tried to it but it made it nauseated. I ended up leaving work early and going home laid down  and have felt bad since. I can&#39;t not laid flat down as it uncomfortable, I propped myself up the bed. I have been up since 4am and have not been able to sleep since. I called the place where I received the vaccine at and they referred me to file a VAERS report. Had COVID in November 2020.

I asked Siri &amp; Alexa if it was ok to take pain reliever after 2nd COVID19 vaccine and they were useless. i had temp of 102 degree. I finally called someone who had reaction and they said Tylenol or Advil. I took Advil at  6am Friday 1/22.  All adverse effects continued throughout day except extreme heart palp. I took Advil at 11am  &amp; 3pm, I took Tylenol at 7pm  and aspirin at 11:30pm &amp; On Saturday at 3:30 am,.  Advil and Tylenol helped slightly, aspirin worked best or I was just exhausted.  I woke up on Saturday at 8:30am  and all was ok, except just tired a and my lower back is in pain still with numbness down leg. Probably  from laying around.

Finally went to Med-One walk-in-clinic on Saturday, January 30th (only one nearby with rapid response) and got and rapid response test for both COVID and the FLU.  Results were negative.  The APRN, at the clinic, asked me to report these symptoms to you.  I have no other health issues that could have caused this abnormality, as I am normally quite healthy.

It moved into the area of where I had that shoulder injury for 5-6 years ago. I could not move my arm due to the pain. It lasted at least 4 days at that pain level. The arm pain at the site was the first thing to improve, but a week 1/2 later I am still having pain in my shoulder. The mobility has improved but it is still really painful to move my arm.   I have been in touch with doctor throughout this, my doctor gave me something for pain and instructed me to continue move my arm as much as possible. I have spoke  with her over the phone and through the portal but have not actually been seen in person.

By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

After the second dose on 2/12/21, I had the standard body aches and slight fever. As I got ready for bed, I took 2 of the chewable Allergy tablets before bed as I had done about 5 other times over the course of 6 months to relieve ear stuffiness that accentuates my tinnitus and impacts my sleep. I never experienced any reaction after taking it those days in previous months.  I took the tablets at 8:45 p.m. on 2/11/21. At 2:00 a.m. on 2/12/21, I woke up from feeling very dizzy and nauseous. I was drenched in sweat and shaking. I opened my eyes and the room was spinning wildly. This went on for 45 minutes. I eventually started throwing up. I began feeling better after the vomiting stopped.

Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

                                                Following my second dose of Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on 2/13/21 I experienced a significant reaction to the second dose: My temperature rose to 102 with headache and arthralgia throughout body that prevented sleep. I was in bed for more than 24 hours due to lightheaded/dizzy/nausea when standing. I fell once when getting back into bed due to loss of balance. Severe symptoms started 15 hours after receiving the dose and lasted approximately 36 hours post dose when my temperature then returned to normal. The next 1-2 days, while I no longer had a fever and symptoms were improved. I was still fatigued and did not feel fully recovered. Treatment during the severe symptoms included rest, icepack to head, Tylenol or Ibuprofen slightly decreased temperature for a brief periods. I informed my physician&#39;s office Dr, of the above reaction and was told to file a VAERS report.

                                                Patient experienced dizziness and felt hot immediately after injection. Her injection site bled and required multiple bandaids and pressure held on area. During this, she felt like she was going to pass out. We provided a cold compress and water. I checked her blood pressure and she reported it being lower than normal (120/82). I re-checked in 5 minutes and it continued to drop to 105/65. I asked the patient if she would like us to call for additional medical attention to be evaluated and she said &#39;yes&#39;. We called 911 and EMS arrived on the scene to further evaluate. Prior to EMS arrival, the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 130/90. The patient&#39;s blood pressure returned to normal about 30 minutes after injection and she did not go to the hospital.

They had a hole in middle and looked like blood. The right side of my face was swollen where i had 3 bumps. Also the ache in the left arm moved to my left calf. Very sore, felt like a charlie horse but I never developed.  I had to limp on the leg a couple of days. I still have the bumps on my face and chest but the hard knots are gone. Just red bumps now. I never  have acne and never had face fillers.

After 1 episode of nausea,  I started experiencing more than mild muscle cramps.  Could not lay on either side.  Darkened room because light/ sound was adding to already severe headache. Used cold washcloths on forehead.  Was having trouble trying to walk, use restroom, frequent urination but could only sip water. Over the next 24 hours...just slept and used bathroom.  Severe muscle cramps, chills, fever, headaches.   Called my Dr.&#39;s nurse-she advised to hydrate and to go to ER if needed.  24 hours later, I realized I would be okay...but took me another 24-36 hours to feel 80% normal.  Lost 8LBs. during 48 hours.  Experienced extreme dreams/delusions.

                                                Around 3:30pm the day after injection I felt queazy with  stomach tightness.  Tested blood sugar.  It was 78.--technically not dangerously low but low for me.  Drank a non-diet Sprite.  Physical discomfort went away.  Felt tired.  Fell asleep for 2-3 hours.  After officially going to bed I woke up approx 2:30am feeling light-headed and shakey which is typical reaction when my blood sugar is too low.  Tested blood sugar.  It was 54.  Ate 7 life saver candies and went back to bed.  The next day (second day after injection) around 3:30pm felt hot which is  another typical reaction when my blood sugar is low.  Didn&#39;t test blood sugar but ate 7 life saver candies.  Then I felt better and continued on with my day.

I thought that a walk would help it but the 50 minute walk did not lessen the pain and my gait was strongly affected.  My blood pressure was way up that day 175/101 and I also had a slight nose bleed.   I never limp and yet I did the entire day!  I woke up the next day and everything was fine.

                                                tiredness; achiness; headache; soreness  of arm; redness from injection site to just above elbow; chills; weakness; vomiting; Symptoms started slightly in the morning and progressing throughout the day.  I did not feel like eating at dinnertime (5:30) but only ate a little with my medication.  Was very tired but stayed awake until about 8:45.  I was so weak I could not stand up to get out of the bathtub (my husband picked me up from behind).  I vomited and felt warm. I went to bed and had a headache in the night that lasted most of the next day (Friday).  I took 2 tylenol in the morning on Friday and then 2 more about 4:00 in the afternoon because i still had the headache.  The redness on my arm lasted until today, Wednesday, Mach 17.  There was also soreness, warmth and itchiness in this area.

                                                Severe pain (nerve type) that began at 10 pm following injection. First injection felt like it was ?grabbing? my arm, different feeling than typical vaccine soreness. First vaccine, kept working on moving arm and was able to overcome. Did have Covid arm beginning on day 8, a nuisance only. I?m known to my physicians as strong, stoic, and have high tolerance to pain. Pain radiated from shoulder through the end of my fingers. Felt like battery acid, and shocking feeling, pure nerve pain. On scale of 1 to 10, pain was 10 most of the night, 8 at best. I avoided  NSAIDS as recommended. Finally took 1/2 tramadol at 7 am, totally immobilized arm with blankets and towels, used medical grade ice packs to control the pain. Pain was significant days 2 and 3 (probably 8), little better third morning. Suddenly at 4:30 this afternoon, most of pain left suddenly. As being a tough woman, this pain was horrid. It was similar to having shoulder surgery when the nerve block ?runs out?, without narcotics to get through the pain. It may have been a high IM injection, but yes 3 fingers down from acromion. Felt high

Which I tried to take, but I cannot handle it. It make me  feel drowsy but I cannot sleep. I still feel dizzy when I lie down and when I turn my head laying down. I just take time to get out of bed. I never had vertigo before. This the first time I experienced vertigo.

Fatigue and Headaches continue daily in the afternoons and evenings.  Then 2 days later my lips started to swell, which progressed in intensity for 3 more days until my lips and tongue split, blistered, developed more asthma and difficulty breathing but not enough to use EpiPen or go to ER, and also my tongue felt thicker.  Called Immunologist on day 6 (Monday morning).  He ordered blood work.  The symptoms started to decrease on day 10 -16 but continue to have to use Symbicort 2x/day vs 1x/day and still get very fatigued as the day progresses and daily headaches.  My lips will swell easily with allergens and an increase in asthma.

I  have taken  2 to 3 Advil just to be able to sleep, today I have taken my 2nd vaccination injection and I am worried, because I still have soreness and pain in the shoulder from the 1st vaccination injection. I immediately started feeling lightheaded from the 2nd dose today; which I expected some maybe cold like symptoms. I do know why I still have pain and soreness in my shoulder, but I am worried, because I should not feel any pain whatsoever anymore at least I thought.  I tried to register with the CDC to have someone contact me my email, I have given multiple ways to check with to help me. Respectfully yours,

On 03/27/2021, her nausea continued and she complained of shortness of breath while walking. On 03/28/2021, she was short of breath before vomiting a small amount. She then became unresponsive. Death was pronounced a short time later.  Per her treating physician who signed the death certificate, the cause of death is felt to be probable myocardial infarction due to electrolyte abnormalities due to complications of her diabetes mellitus.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                After receiving my shot on Friday, my arm began to get sore, my ears felt like they were on fire.  I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 I felt a little strange.  Just not myself. A little dizzy.  Went to work overnight.  Got up at 5 am Friday, Jan 8, 2021.  Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

                                                Approx. 12:30am I awoke to a leg cramp. I arose from bed and stood up till the cramping muscle relaxed.  Then I walked to the restroom and during the short distance,I felt a sudden &#34;flush&#34;.  Upon entering restroom, I felt I was getting faint.  Feeling that I was about ready to faint, I tried to easily lower myself to the floor without striking my head or body.  Feeling very dizzy and faint, my stomach instantly felt nauseous and then vomited.  After vomiting, I  suddenly started to &#34;shake very violently&#34; (chills?).  The shaking was uncontrollable and went on for approx. 10 -15 min.  I tried to relieve the violent shaking by covering up with bath towels, that I was able to reach from the floor, where I was still sitting; but that did not seem to help.  After I did not feel so faint, I called for help to have my husband help me back into bed to try to warm up.  By that time the shaking (chills) were no longer so severe, and I was gradually able to fall back to sleep with no further problems the remainder of the night.  The following morning, and ever since that night, I have had no other adverse reactions.   For many years, I have received the yearly flu vaccine and have never had any kind of reaction, accept some minor soreness at the injection site (muscle).

Her doctor said that he did not believe it to be cellulitis at this time and prescribed her a steroid cream.

I returned to the vaccination distribution site - EMT&#39;s checked my O2, pulse and blood pressure which were all normal.  They check my blood sugar which was at 40.  I had eaten about 90 minutes before (egg, toast, coffee).  They administered glucose and rechecked 10 minutes later.  I was at 41.  I was oriented and by then the numbness and dizziness had subsided and has completely resolved. I experienced flu-like symptoms beginning in the evening of 1/22 and continuing consisting of tiredness, body aches, runny nose, sneezing, cough, stomach rumblings and diarrhea (mainly on 1/24).

On Tuesday she developed acute dizziness, weaknes, tremors. Evaluated in ER. But also went to different hospital because of the symptoms. She received fluids at second evaluation and has been trying to keep the fluids up. She did not start feeling better until Saturday, and still has eposodes of feeling weak/fatigued and has some dizziness, but overall she has improved. The fatigue is similar, but more intense, than what she had when she eats eggs (she has an egg allergy).

On 2/20/21 still a slight headache, took 2 Tylenol then went out and walked about a mile, visited family, then walked back home.  By the time I got home I was barely able to walk up the stairs.  Felt exhausted and nauseous.  Slept for a few hours and got up and just sat on the couch for another few hours and then felt that same nausea and exhaustion and went to bed. Took 2 more Tylenol. Started drinking more water.  On 2/21/21 felt pretty good -- stayed in all day -- ate a little -- but saw the site on my arm just under the injection site was very large, red, and hot to the touch.  The red welt area went from just below the injection in the left arm to just above the elbow.   On 2/22/21 (today) feel pretty good.  Drinking a lot of water and tool 1 Tylenol.

                                                At 11am on 2/16, my arm began to get sore.  I took Advil at 4pm and it wasn&#39;t so bad.  At about 10pm when I went to bed, I had issues falling asleep because my heart felt like it was pounding through my chest.   That pounding came off and on during the next day.  I woke up twice and my feet were ice cold and my body was very hot.  The second time I woke I thought I would take some tylenol and was extremely dizzy walking to the bathroom.  I was so weak I couldn&#39;t open the bottle.  I slept nine hours, very unusual.  I felt very under the weather all day until around 5pm.  I woke up the next morning feeling pretty normal.  The arm pain was completely gone by the 18th.

PCP; She gave me medicine to get sugar down;  Jarviance 1/21 Blood sugar went up to 495; went to ER.Opthamologist;  He told me nothing he could do for me. He told me I had vision reversed due to sugar being so high. He told me he couldn&#39;t give me any glasses as when sugar decreases, the vision will go back to normal.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

Fell asleep for a while and when I woke up had pain in my right hip going down my leg like sciatica!  Following day, Thursday,  the pain was worse and had trouble standing on leg.  Rested all day.  Not really pain anywhere else, just right hip and down leg.  Friday morning felt better but started again in the afternoon and evening.  Saturday went to Urgent Care as the pain was very bad, could barely stand on my leg again.  Was given Flexeril and Naproxyn which is not touching it!  Using heat and ice.  Right now nothing is working.  Hard time standing on leg.

                                                Around 12 noon, approximately 20 hours after receiving second dose of Moderna Covid 19 vaccine I started feeling lightheaded, was unable to concentrate and felt like I was going to pass out, leg muscles became achy and rubbery feeling.  Sat down and put my head down to avoid collapsing.  Sat for about 15 minutes like this and became very warm and began sweating profusely.  Felt nauseous and had dry heaves.  Stood up and put my head down on our sink. (I was at work at the time as a retail pharmacist)  Stayed in this position about another 10 minutes.  Finally my head felt like it was starting to clear so I stood up and was able to walk around the department.  Went back to my workstation and was able to concentrate but then felt very chilled to the point where I started shaking.  This lasted about 20 minutes.  Shaking gradually stopped but then I felt very tired.  Was able to finish my shift 2 hours later, was able to drive home but felt very tired and was having muscle pain in my lower legs (thighs to ankles) and developed a mild headache.  Took one  Aleve (naproxen sodium) tablet around 4pm that afternoon.  Started feeling somewhat &#34;normal&#34; later in the evening around 8pm.  Woke up Sunday 3/14/21 and felt fine.

                                                The day I got the vaccine, I waited 15 minutes at the clinic for any immediate adverse reaction.  While driving myself home, I felt this strange sensation of warmth course through my body and immediate light-headedness resulted.  I wondered if I were going to pass out and whether I should pull over.  But I continued driving home and have been light-headed (even dizzy if I move my head too much) since then.  I tried drinking a lot of water, resting, taking an antihistamine and ibuprofen, but none of those changed the way I felt, although it doesn&#39;t feel as bad if I am sitting still and lying down.  After six days of no improvement, I went to the doctor (on March 15th), who prescribed meclizine to help with the light-headedness.  They also took blood to check for other possible causes of the light-headedness.  They said the feeling will probably go away, and they gave me a doctor&#39;s note indicating that my second does of the vaccine could be Johnson and Johnson, since that is not an mRNA drug .  They said I should wait 28 days at least before getting that.  I will likely wait a little longer than that just to be safe, and I will not even take that if this feeling doesn&#39;t go away by then.

My b.p. went up &amp; I felt anxious &amp; exhausted. Arm hurt. No temp. On day 3 ( I believe..or day 4) arm became even more painful &amp; A round rash appeared. My chest &amp; neck were also red again . I took pictures of my arm, chest &amp; neck.

Patient has only ever had slight osteo-arthritis starting in her hands before, so this issue with suddenly not being able to walk is coming completely out of the blue. ? ?Have you heard of any delayed reactions to the vaccine like this? ? ?Is it possible? ?

                                                Wednesday night I felt tired and cold. Woke up Thursday morning and couldn&#39;t lift up my head. Migraine was in all of top teeth, ears, behind eyes, all over head. Pain was so extreme I fainted in bed. Came to and pain was a bit better but quickly came back full force. Woke up at 1am Friday morning drenched from sweat through to the mattress but migraine was better. Ran fever up to 102 and down and up all day Friday. Saturday fever was only 100 but came back after each sweat. Sunday I had almost no fever and just a regular head ache. Monday exhausted but okay.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.     On 03 Mar 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Mar 2021, the patient experienced severe diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort. At 4 AM she had lost consciousness and fell after urinating and hit her head on the curb of the shower. Her husband found her and when he saw her, she was cold, clammy and very sweaty. Her husband reported that the patient had low blood pressure that caused syncope and caused her to fall. The patient was in a semi-delirious state and was confused, tremulous. The cramps were intermittent for 1-2 hours. The patient was in a borderline shock or in shock as she was very dizzy when she stood up. The events were resolved after four hours. On the next day her temperature was at 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, loss of consciousness, fall, cold sweats, hyperhidrosis, hypotension, syncope, confusional state, tremors, muscle spasms, shock and dizziness were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

                                                I first experienced some nausea immediately after receiving the vaccine, but it went away after I ate something after my vaccination. I then experienced pain at the injection site a couple of hours after receiving the injection. Around 10 p m,,. I started having episodes of waking up and having too throw up phlegm. The next day I had a lot of sinus pain and a headache. My left arm continued to hurt, and I noticed I couldn&#39;t lift it sideways all the way to my head. At my shoulder, it would want to turn towards my body. Most of the pain has subsided, but I still am having difficulty lifting my arn,

                                                On 11 Mar 2021 at 11:00 am (23.5 hours post vaccine) I had a mild headache and significant dizziness. I had to leave my work desk. This lasted for approximately 2 hours and then &#34;lifted&#34; and I went back to work.  At 4:00pm, about 5 hours later (28.5 hours post vaccine) I felt a total lack of concentration, extreme fatigue, and dizziness. I should have left my desk but had work I needed to complete. This episode also lasted for about 2 hours and then I felt pretty normal again. The following day, on 12 Mar 2021, at 5:00 pm (53.5 hours post vaccine) I had what I described to my sister as  crazy dizziness and extreme lethargy. This lasted for 2-3 hours, I was able to go out with my husband to a store, but was not able to drive. I also experience two days where I had a metallic taste in my mouth. It was not overwhelming, and since I&#39;m sensitive to odors and chemicals anyway I just assumed that there was something in my home I was exposed to, even though that had never happened to me before in my home. This probably occurred on day 3 &amp; 4  post vaccine (13 Mar 2021 and 14 Mar 2021) but I did not annotate the details. I am very suspicious this was also related to the vaccine. As I think about my past few days, especially while at work, I think I am having a harder time than normal concentrating, although at times I have perfect clarity and feel normal.

I had to hold on the walls when had to go to the bathroom.  I was by myself and feared falling.  I had to put a bucket next to me because I felt like throwing up.  I couldn&#39;t move my head, eyes anything with out severe dizziness and nausea.  Finally after 9 hours it started to ease off, but took another 15 hours for me not to stumble periodically.  I am 10 days out now and still can&#39;t turn my head too quickly, or put it too far back when washing my hair, or moving my eyes to fast, I still have a few minutes of dizziness which makes me nauseous for several minutes.  Still at night when I lay down, it feels like my head is spinning!  I have heard about people with vertigo and how debilitating it is... and I now understand.  I fear this  dizziness and nausea will not go away!!!!   It now feels like I am car sick several times a day.

Ten seconds later, her husband said that she felt like she was going to pass out. Upon getting to the patient, I felt for a pulse and observed mild breathing. The patient was unconscious and did not awaken with a sternum rub. The patient&#39;s husband helped me lower her to the ground, and I administered one dose of Epipen to the patient&#39;s lateral left thigh. She awakened and was able to state where she was, the year, and the president. EMT arrived later, and the patient refused further medical treatment.

Hip to below knew, dull and numbish; from below knee thru toes, same tingling as fingers. Biggest concern was side of face and jaw; dull and numbish. All these reactions occurred on right side of body. Thursday late afternoon, the tingling and the dull and numbish diminishes but the arm aching along with inability to completely raise remains. Friday; arm remains the same Saturday; arm below injection site now feels only bruised NOTE: while I enjoy a strong immune system, by body is very sensitive to new medicines/tweaking medicines. Also applies to food.  APPROX 25 years ago, I believe I contracted Gullian Barre, where the immune system attacks nervous system. There was./is no test to confirm although I continue to endure some side effects. QUESTION- with all said is it advisable to receive the 2nd vaccine shot?   Please advise ASAP

                                                I had soreness in the left arm for @ 2 days after the vaccination.  No redness, no swelling.   After that, no known problem.  Exactly one week after the injection, On the morning of Tuesday, January 5, 2021, I noticed soreness in my left arm similar to what I had right after the injection. It was painful to extend my arm over my head.  Later that day, I noticed a small 1 3/4&#34; x 1&#34; area of redness and warmth appearing at or right next to the area of the injection.  Over the next 24-48 hours, the area grew and became swollen, more red, and warmer.  The soreness in my arm didn&#39;t seem to change at all; it was painful to lift my arm overhead and to touch.  The area grew to approximately 3&#34; x 4&#34; during that time period.  On Thursday morning, 1/7/21, my PCP, inspected the area and felt the swelling and the warmth.  She believed that I had likely developed cellulitis in the arm and placed me on cephalexin 500 mg, one capsule tid.  I began taking that on Thursday afternoon, 1/7/21.   By Friday evening, the area was barely visible, but was still warm and a little swollen.  It was still slightly tender. Today, Saturday, 1/9/21, the area is still a little warm and slightly swollen, but not visible at all, and there is only tenderness if I press on the area.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min. Within 5 mins, heat rose up to my head causing dizziness &amp; head spin. Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

Felt so horrible, had to go to bed, slept on and off throughout the night.  Woke up Sunday, feeling better, not 100%.  I?m concerned if on January 16th was a reaction because it was two full days after receiving the injection.

Note I could feel what felt like bumps under the skin vs. above the skin or that they could be seen.   Due to providing support services to a disabled brother at his home during this evening, I did not take any benadryl  or any related medication.  I used cool compress at the site and called my husband to give him an alert.  I had both a landline phone and a mobile phone (which has a medical alert service at the push of 1 button that I could talk to/or that would automotically respond) as I was aware to watch for breathing difficulties...I experienced none.  I alerted our school system nurse about the issue the next morning and she guided me to contact my PCP which I did.  I could not be seen that day, but was no worse regarding symptomes and knew I needed to go to ER or a Urgent Care if anything worsened  which it didn&#39;t.  Around 5 p.m. on Friday evening when I was able  to be at my own home I took 1 dose of benadryl (allergen/dye free), drank alots of liquids and rested.  During Saturday I still felt effects of benadryl, but vaccine related things cleared up.  Monday,  1/25 7:15 a.m. to 7:45 a.m. while at home working on my computer, my left eye vision became very distorted like my vision was jumping around/unfocused...no issues of this before and I am not prone to headaches such as migraines..I was getting concerned that I might need to call work that I could not come as was afraid to drive and it cleared up.  Note:  I have routinely gotten many types of vaccines due to working in the medical field and needed to care for at risk family members (flu, phenmonia (sp), shingles, hepititis, tetnus, booster for other preventive illnesses) and have never had adverse reactions.  I do plan to get the second dose of the Moderna vaccine as I work for a school system and am primry care giver for a medical and disability comprimised younger brother.

Approximately 12:30-1:00 AM on 01/09/2021 woke up, turned my head and experienced room spinning dizziness for about 2 minutes. Had to remain completely still to stop the room spinning.  For the next 2 days (until the morning of Monday 01/11/2021)  I experienced on and off room spinning dizziness at unpredictable intervals.  Usually didn&#39;t last longer than 2 minutes but had to remain completely still to stop the spinning.   Starting on Monday 01/11/2021 had &#34;normal&#34; dizziness along with some flu like symptoms,  headache, tiredness,  soreness/achiness and extreme soreness and pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine shot. I stayed out of work because of the on-going dizziness. These symptoms continued until Saturday 01/16/2021.  I took an antihistamine on Saturday night and finally woke up Sunday 01/17/2021 with no dizziness.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

The cough still continued &amp; my high blood pressure still continued the lowest it got 144 over79. I experienced moments of weakness &amp; that&#39;s when my blood pressure would shoot up.  I called my doctor on the 12/30/2021 I called my doctor and he started me on medications &amp; he told me to keep track of my blood pressure. On 12/31/2021 everything began to diminish except the blood pressure that one continued. The high blood pressure continued all the way towards the end of January.

                                                My right shoulder was extremely painful. Unable to move or use my arm for 24 hrs. Was in so much pain that I took Oxycodone at 12:00 am, another at 3:00 am. TYLENOL with codeine at 5:00 am and another at 7 :00 am. Was not expecting so much pain. If I did not have the RXs, I would have to go to the emergency room. I still have pain and it goes down by arm. I have been told that the injection was given to high.

                                                1st day - patient reports everything was ok. 2nd day - patient reports pain at the injection site, and it was painful to move her arm. 3rd day - patient reports that it was painful to move her arm, that she had to move slowly to avoid causing pain. She reports intermittent pain, level 8-9/10, caused by motion, that irradiated to her back and it was controlled using Advil. She reports a 6-7/10 pain level after taking Advil. She refers to experiencing this kind of pain on day 3 to 4 post-injection, did not feel it on day 4 to 5, but again on day 5 to 6 experienced it again. Now she reports &#34;feeling like it&#39;s coming&#34; but she rests and it gets better. 4th-5th day - patient reports abdominal discomfort, like the one caused when a &#34;baby moves in your womb&#34;.  To this day, she refers feeling weak, sometimes when lifting her LT arm she feels intermittent weakness from her hand to her elbow and has to rest her extremity. Today she reports waking up with a discomfort in the back of her neck that lasted 10 minutes and then was able to move her neck/head side to side and up and down.

                                                The same day I received the vaccine, some hours later I started feeling like a pressure in my head. It was not a headache, it was a pressure. It made me dizzy. I also experienced extreme fatigue and so much that it was hard to walk. Really hard to just get out of the bed. Like my legs did not want to move. I had to literally mover them from the bed. Cough. My doctor said after I had covid in June 2020 that my lungs were damaged and now they just work on a 61% capacity. I also felt like my lungs were burning. When I am able to have a productive cough and get rid of some phlegm, then I feel better, I can really breathe and feel like clean air in my lungs. But lots of times I just cough and nothing comes out and then it gives me a sensation that my chest is tight. Still, every morning I cough, just like this morning and my chest feel tight.

                                                Should I be seeking medical attention?   Initially had itching for a few minutes, along with arm pain.  Quickly developed headache on right side of head.  Right side of neck, face, lip, arm, and right upper torso ached and felt tingly, like the feeling you get when a dentist gives you novacaine.  This accompanied dizziness which subsided after 10 minutes.  I was examined at the site and vitals were deemed okay.    Over the course of the day, the headache lessened and the torso lost the numbing feeling.  I had a knot at the injection site which gradually went down when I put heat on it. The only residuals I am feeling 22 hours later is numbness in the lip, and of course, my arm aches.  The numbness is aggravating, and I wonder how long it will last.

I believe I had slept on it. Day 8 developed itchy rash near the top of left shoulder 9 ?Down forearm, day 13 rash devolped bumps-I have photos of the rash and bumps. Day 14 rash diminishes. Pain in left arm/shoulder continues Day 22 noticed lump (lymph node)base of neck left side-almond sized. From day 15 to 22 lost arm mobility -it was very painful to raise my left arm &amp;especially out to the side.  March 9 I saw my general practitioner. The swollen lymph node at the base of my neck is diminishing in size and flattening out.

The pain lasted all night and in the morning I could barely get out of bed.  I was able to slide out of bed with considerable pain.  Once up I struggled to bend at all. My husband had to put my socks and shoes on.  I had to take him to get a medical procedure that morning and I could barely get in the car.  I took an Alieve before we left because   sitting down was excruciating.  I had everything I could do to get up and down from chairs while waiting.  When we got back about 10:30 I took another Alieve.  It was starting to calm down.  I took another Alieve later in the evening and today it still hurts but not as bad.  Now it includes my right Knee.   I have never had these pains before.   I am concerned about my second shot.

                                                Got a fever and chills which seemed expected on Sunday  evening the day after the shot on 3/6/21. On Monday, I was fine but tired and went to bed about 11PM. I awoke to the feeling that the room was spinning even with my eyes closed and when I opened my eyes the room continued to spin around me. I could barely stand up when I tried. Felt nauseated but did not vomit. The vertigo continued off and on on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday especially when I would lay flat either on my back or stomach if I turned my head. I went to my doctor this morning who ruled out an ear infection or wax build up. She encouraged me to contact her if it continued after a week. I have only had vertigo two times in my life, both after a physical trauma to my head (car accident when I as 30, and surprise tackle during touch football) when I was 53. This struck me as an unusual side effect  from the vaccine since I have never had vertigo without a prior event like an accident.  I am in good health otherwise.

As I drove, I started getting a sparkly effect in my vision (for me, this is usually a precursor to migraine), about 2 hours after the injection. After I got home, I started getting a minor headache, about 2.5 hours after injection. I sat for awhile, and the headache did not worsen and the sparkles dissipated. About 9 hours after the injection (and after preparing and eating dinner) I began to feel lightheaded, almost a feeling of inebriation. I quickly prepared for bed and went to sleep. About 2 hours later, I woke up with diarrhea. I continued to wake up twice more, about 2-2.5 hours apart, with diarrhea. I finally slept for about 4 hours and woke up feeling better.

                                                Last part of vaccine sent a tingling feeling down my arm to my middle finger. Once the needle was out it stopped. Came home and iced the area once. 5:15 pm first chills started. Went away after I drank hot tea. Headache started and stayed the rest of the night until next morning. Also at 5:15 started the achy body feeling, my joints hurt. I have a total knee replacement on the right side and it ached. I had a hard time to walk up and down the steps in our house. I was suddenly real tired. Went to bed at 9:00 pm exhausted and feeling nauseated. Slept until 11:15 pm when I woke up to my teeth chattering. Put wool socks and sweater on and extra blanket. Fell back to sleep. Woke up at 7:00 am felt better,  but after being up a short time I felt  off. Took a nap at noon because I became real tired. Slept until 2 that afternoon (now Friday day after injection) and woke up feeling like myself.  Saturday I felt fine. Sunday I woke up to a cold sore on my lip. Tender to  the touch at the injection site but nothing by Sunday.

                                                2/10 1015 AM 10PM I was extremely fatigued. Slight HA. Dizziness/light vertigo. Sore shoulder on left. Symptoms with stomach cramping lasted into 2/11, all day. By 9PM, I had a severe HA, chills, spent most day in bed. My heart was pounding. Couldn&#39;t lay down, HA was throbbing. Temp was 101.5. I contacted my PCM. Advised to rotate between Tylenol and Motrin. The fever did break overnight.  2/12 I was still feeling fatigue, HA. No fever, no chills. Still having vertigo with chest tightness. That had set in on the 2/11. Started my albuterol on 2/11 and lasted till 2/16 with a slight cough.  2/16 Dr was able to see me. She could feel the inflammation in my chest. *Exacerbated the problem because on 2/13 I felt chest tightness and thought it was the asthma, exercises made my symptoms worsen. The acid reflux gave me the sense I was having tight chestness due to the asthma but it was actually due to me exercising on 2/13 which worsened by the 2/15-2/16. I had still had the chest pain, HA Prescribed Advil.

                                                To give context to the adverse event, in early November 2020 I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy of unknown origin on the left side of my face. I was tested for COVID-19 and it came back negative. It resolved itself in about a month. About 8 hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine on 3/9/21 (about 6:30 p.m., I started to feel a slight headache. Because I had just had the vaccine, I was trying to avoid taking any pain medication, so I did not take anything for it. The headache got worse throughout the evening, and by 10 p.m. I would describe it as a moderate headache. It was primarily concentrated on the left side of my head towards the front, on my forehead and above the eyebrow. I went to bed without taking any pain medication. About 3 hours later, at about 1 p.m., I woke up, and the headache was much more intense. It felt like all the nerves around the left side of my face, including the nerve along my jaw line leading to the 7th cranial nerve that causes Bell&#39;s Palsy, were throbbing. I grew concerned about getting Bell&#39;s Palsy again, so at that time I took one ibuprofen Advil. After taking it, the headache subsided, although I continued to have a dull headache throughout the night and the next day. Patient received the vaccine Monday March 1st around 2:30pm. Patient began to feel arm soreness around 5pm, woke up at 3am the following morning with a severe headache and spent the next day resting. Wednesday morning March 3rd, the patient reported extreme fatigue, dizziness and feeling &#34;woozy&#34;. As she was walking around the store, around 8:30am, patient had to request help as she almost fainted. Patient went home quickly after, reported dizziness until 3pm. Patient&#39;s friend who is a nurse came to her home to check her vitals, confirmed they were normal and encouraged fluids/rest. After resting further Wednesday/Thursday, patient returned to work Friday morning and has been fine since. Patient did not take any medications prior/during/after incident.

However, with the 2nd shot my left arm/shoulder started hurting a lot by the next morning, which was 2/12/21. It felt like my arm/shoulder locked up and I could not move it. When I did try to move it , it would click and pop and had severe shooting pain with arm weakness. I could not reach out and grab anything over a pound or two. It continued to get worse, and the pain was 24/7. By the 3rd week it seemed to be improving slightly so I sent a message to my provider to report my side effects. She told me that it had affected her joints as well, but at 3 weeks she was improving. She recommended that if this continued another week or

Chills that night and body aches getting very bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep with lots of blankets on because I was so cold and room temp was 72 degrees, my usual.  No fever.  Tylenol extra strength didn&#39;t help at all.  This went on 7 days.  Dizzy the second day,very itchy skin, no rash, ear ache in right ear only that day.  Very bad headache and photophobia for 5 days.  No desire to eat or drink 6 days, but I could keep water down.  Third day severe gas pains, like labor pains with lots of gas, cramps.  I thought I&#39;d faint from the pain.  Nausea and dry heaves at the same time with diarrhea.  I hadn&#39;t had food in 3 days or any bowel movements to this point.  Felt very tired and weak.  Not able to sleep, comfortably  until the seventh day. Had a stiff neck. I did have a positive Covid result, asymptomatic 1 month before my first vaccine

Arms shaking so badly they were not functioning.  Happened a second time 5 days later. Wide awake, getting ready to shower. This wasn&#39;t what I would call chills. Seemed more like a seizure to me. It didn&#39;t last long, only about 30 seconds, but it was very intense.  Only happened two times, but never had that happen before I had the vaccine. Both events happened within 2 weeks of having the vaccine.  I am due for my 2nd shot on 3/18, and I&#39;m a little bit concerned about any potential side effects.

                                                So much pain in my left arm that it became immovable by the next day.  It felt like my arm was broken and needed to be in a cast.  I finally had to put my arm in a sling to keep it from moving around.   I could hardly sleep and basically lost the next day (03/17/21), being in pain and sleeping on and off throughout the day.  This even through taking Motrin and/or Aleve.  Today is day 2 after the injection.  My arm is still very sore, but I can let it hang down.  I cannot raise it though.  I am taking Aleve twice daily and feel tired even though I slept for 12 hours last night.

The pain emanated from the three joints; the shoulder joint, the elbow joint and the wrist joint.  The pain was intense, sharp and continuous and made it impossible to move my arm .

There were five waves.   After 1 1/2 hours, it stopped and I went home.   Later that night, I was very thirty, couldn&#39;t sleep and my kidneys were sore.   Next morning, I could not raise my arm from the pain.  Every day since, I have had another wave of the same pains once in the morning and then again in the evening.   Each wave lasted 1 to 2 hours.   I would sleep and afterwards felt better.  Saturday March 20th, the wave at night was the worst one and it lasted 3 hours.   The wave today March 21st, the wave was smaller and then I could sleep.

Vitals were stable, there was no throat closure, no SOB or wheezing. She requested to get her albuterol inhaler refilled. Several attempts to get her to sit up and walk failed due to continue dizziness. She was transferred to room in blue side, there she used her inhaler, was given water, and laid down. She was observed for 3 hours. Eventually she contacted friend who came to pick her up. She was told not to drive until she felt better. Transported to friend&#39;s car with wheelchair. Friend was going to be with her for some time.

I then gave her a 25 mg dose of benadryl and she did fine. The reaction stopped. Then I spoke with the pt about 6:30pm  and the throat problem had completely resolved, but she said that she was having left wrist pain and that that arm sort of felt heavy and she said it actually started while she was here but didn&#39;t say anything. I told her to take some tylenol and to watch this situation and report back if it continued to be a problem.

It is my sense that I was improperly inoculated outside the deltoid muscle, hitting the axillary nerve. The symptoms came on almost immediately, though (since it&#39;s a while ago) I cannot be reliably sure of the time. The pharmacist injecting me was very scattered, in my opinion, and perhaps tired from a long day of immunization. My sense is that she failed to properly landmark my arm. I am a short-stature woman with good muscle tone, if that helps. I am seeking medical evaluation on 4/9 and, likely, will start physical therapy to regain range of motion, which is disabling.

The vision issues have increased the MS Optic Nuritis problems, loosing vision in right eye!  But its the headaches I can&#39;t stand.  They come and go, and sometimes its sooo bad that I can&#39;t move my head and body.  Sitting in the dark helps.  Thus having MS and lowered immune system has the headaches causing me to be immobile during episodes, sometimes lasting only an hour, sometimes all day!   And chills, but not as bad as the headaches.  I don&#39;t want to lose my vision again due to having to do these vaccines every year with these side affects.

After the vaccination, I felt fine; no side effects for about 5 hours.  At approximately 4:30pm, I got the chills, body, muscles and back aches, fever - 101.2, sore throat, my eye balls hurt and a sore scalp.  All of these effects came one like a wave. My entire body ached and I felt as though I was run over by a steam roller. I took Tylenol, 500mg at 5:30am and the next day, April 7th at 11:30am and still had a fever. My entire body was in  pain and discomfort and I could barely move and was unable to work for 4 days and laid up on the weekend.  To-date, I am still feeling tired, achy and lethargic.

I layed down on my office floor, , my heart rate went up to 140 BPM and BP was around 140/76. My MA checked it . One of my physician colleague&#39;s that was nearby checked on me as well as the nurse that gave me the injections. it took about 30-40 minutes for the symptoms to subside. I was sent to our Urgent care dept in the same clinic by wheelchair at around 12:30-12:40 pm. I was evaluated and my symptoms subsided in 30-40 minutes. I was out of Urgent care at 1:25 pm, able to walk upstairs back to my office and felt okay and was seeing patients again at 1:30 PM.  This reaction was similar to getting a shot of Novocaine w/ epinephrine for a dental procedure I received a few years ago, so if I were to sum it up it was like getting a shot of epinephrine. it was not a vasovagal reaction as my BP was high. I have felt fine since. I plan to get the second vaccine. Any suggestions to avoid these symptoms w/ the second one would be appreciated.

When I woke to get a shower around 5:30 am on 1/6/2021, I was extremely lightheaded and laid down on the bathroom floor to keep from passing out and falling. The lightheadedness did not improve and my husband was able to help me back to bed. I was unable to overcome the chills and lightheadedness even with lying down, until about 10 am. I am able to sit up but still some what lightheaded and chills are beginning to fade. I do not feel I would be able to walk more than a few feet or drive at this time due to ongoing symptoms.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011L20A) intramurally in the left deltoid bursa for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 02 Jan 2021, the patient reported she had been given the vaccine in the wrong location. The vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle. The patient was also experiencing loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and she also can&#39;t sleep. Treatment information was not provided. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. The event vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle was considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events loss of range of motion, can&#39;t sleep, and pain at the injection site were considered not recovered/not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of 65 year old female patient who experienced non-serious unexpected events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle for mRNA-1273, lot #  011L20A. The patient experienced loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and can&#39;t sleep. Onset latency was not provided.  De-challenge and re-challenge are not applicable. Based on the information provided the events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle, loss of range of motion and can&#39;t sleep are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 as this is due to product administration error. The event of pain at the injection site is included in the known safety profile of the vaccine, hence a causal association cannot be excluded.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

                                                At 45-50 minutes after my injection I was walking and felt my blood pressure bottom out.  I stumbled and felt as if I was going to faint.  I recovered quickly.  Once home I monitored my blood pressure and it was low.  The lowest reading was 88/70.  I laid down and within a couple hours my pressure was more normal. I did not feel faint at that time.  I have severe anxiety and am not sure if that contributed to this episode.  Additionally, my blood pressure is on the low side of normal.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

                                                I felt anxious after the shot, but that night felt ok. Morning was another story. I woke up with pain in my muscles from the waist down and found it difficult to walk. My eyes started to hurt. I had blurred vision. Around 2:00 I went by the mirror and saw that my eyes were blood red. I laid down and rested. About 2 hours later I got up the most of the redness was gone but then I had a headache.  The next  morning a persistent cough and the sneezes started.  The headache would return every time that I coughed or sneezed. It was very painful- as if someone hit me with a hammer.  Even though the pain only lasted a few minutes, it hurt a lot. I sneezed and cough a lot. Finally, Sunday morning I was walking better; however, I felt I had the flu. Normally, I would have gone in and got ready for a sub, but I wasn&#39;t able to. I rested on the couch. Then took a 2 hour nap. Finally, I felt better around 6 pm except for the painful headache that returned every time I coughed or sneezed. It has been a week. I thought the worse would be over by now. I guess I will have to go in and talk to my doctor on Monday because the sneezes and coughs are still quite painful. When will it end?

I was feeling a little tired.   After 24 hours, the muscle in the injected arm was very sore.   It was hard to lift the arm even up to my shoulder.   I had a headache and was fatigued.   By 32 hours after the vaccine, I was starting to feel better.   By 48 hours after the vaccine, I was feeling good.   The sore arm muscle lasted about 72 hours.

The left muscle in my left side of my neck stiffened.  As we left the area and headed down the street I was getting anaphalactic:  numb jaw, swelling tongue, closed throat, eyes closing, inner cheeks numb - as if I was severely novacained from the dentist.  I was able to breathe ok to  get home hoping it would pass and drank wanter to keep things fluid.  I was there for one hour.  On advice, I went to the ER to get checked out.

Fell into a 3 hour deep sleep. Woke up feeling foggy brained &amp; clumsy.  At 3am the next day my throat felt thick &amp; dry with difficulty swallowing.  Went to ER at 3:30. Was told my tonsils were swollen. I did not have a sore throat.  Dr tested for strepp throat with negative result. I was given a shot of benedryl &amp; an oral Allegra pill. Symptoms began to subside &amp; I was sent home. Nasty headache &amp; wobblyness continued through the day &amp; into the following day. Started feeling better Sunday night

Symptoms disappeared after 30-36 hours.  Had some digestive distress after this but was probably related to not having eaten for over 24 hours &amp; then resuming.

I knew my mouth was hanging open and couldn&#39;t shut it. My husband took my blood pressure,  it was 61/50.  After a few minutes I was coming to, blood pressure began to come back up. My husband had called 911 when my blood pressure dropped so low.  By the time they arrived it was back up to normal.   I have never had any problems with blood pressure,  low or high. Or with dizziness,  fainting etc. I am very sure it was from the vaccine

                                                Vaccinated at 1:20 PM on 1/26/2021. Approximately 15 min later I was in the waiting area, the nurse had been pre-notified to watch me for allergic reaction . In 15 minutes my symptoms were fast heart rate, lips burning, dark red facial flushing, ears flushing, and anterior neck flush, body tremors, a rapid response team notified to evaluate me. I was administered a 25 mg  Benadryl tablet per mouth.  I felt stabilized and chose to go to the ER within the building for further evaluation.  Remaining stabilized, had a 4 hour wait until I was seen by emergency staff. My treatment was Solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25 mg po. I was placed on a heart monitor and a pulse oximeter to check my oxygen levels the entire time I was in the ER. 4 hours prior to being seen by the ER doctors I had a CBC, a BMP blood work, and an EKG. After medications were administered I was observed approximately 1.5-2 hours. I was discharged with a 5 day medicine regimen to follow. Prednisone 40 mg per day; Pepcid 40 mg per day; Benadryl 25 mg every 6 hours. On 1/27 I chose to take the Benadryl 25 mg only because I had received the Pepcid and Prednisone the previous night late. On the 28th I took the medicine as prescribed but only took Benadryl every 12 hours. I felt Benadryl 4 times a day would not be handled well with my body. On 1/30 I was able to take the Pepcid and Prednisone but had to discontinue the Benadryl due to waking up with a spinning sensation upon opening eyes and a loss of equilibrium upon walking. I completed my medicine regimen on 2/1. Today 2/2 I woke up with symptoms of watery eyes, flushed face, mild facial itching, after drinking one cup of full caffeine coffee developed an increased heart rate and nervousness, was medicated with Benadryl 25 mg po at 10:00 AM along with my blood pressure medicine and potassium. Also at that time my blood pressure was 150/80. Three hours later my blood pressure had come down to 130s/60s but felt extreme weakness and felt the need to lay down and rest with legs elevated.  I continue with my day with increased heart rate with activity, so I have remained inactive for the rest of the day.   Also on 6:00 AM on 1/27 I was awakened with a heart rate In the 160s, I called 911, paramedics came 5 minutes later. On arrival my heart rate had instantly went down to the  112-120 range. The paramedics explained they have been treating COVID patients and have seen this a lot, we discussed going to the hospital but I felt I was stabilized and didn&#39;t need further treatment.   Also upon discharge from ER visit they had me get 2 epi-pens and I now have 2 epi-pens available at home.

Passed out 3 times - per my husband trying to go the bathroom. These systoms lasted from 10.30 pm till 8.00am the next morning. Severe nausea continued and my doctor prescribe ondansetron.  This is the sickest I can remember being in my life.  I am very concerned about me passing out.

                                                Three days after receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine I developed severe radiating low back and leg pain and inflammation and pain in my right knee .  I also developed a persistent pain in my right hand and thumb along with &#34;trigger finger&#34; type symptoms in my hand where it clenches up and I cant open my hand up without using force. At times the pain is so bad I am unable to walk normally  and also unable to utilize my right hand to open or hold things.  In the 22 days that have passed since the shot the symptoms have not subsided and are effecting my ability to get around and carry my normal activities of daily life.

                                                First, extreme upper arm discomfort after nursing student had difficulty stopping the bleeding.  Then, within 5 minutes, felt somewhat dizzy as pain radiated across shoulder, up spine and neck, into jaw and right ear.  Then, horrible jabbing pain under shoulder blade, followed by a feeling of extreme compression from site of injection to wrist.  Checked every 10 minutes or so by nurses for 50 minutes.  They said that redness first was up arm then down arm.  Once light headedness improved, I left for work (remote teaching from home).  By 3:20, I found it hard to focus, the throbbing under my shoulder and compression feeling of my arm increased with diminished feeling in right hand.  Usually 97.2 temperature but ran low-grade temp of about 99 degrees for 3 to 4 days.  Sleepless night first night with increased pain and discomfort, i.e., no new symptoms but all symptoms increase with difficulty turning neck and head.  Area around injection warm for several days, with swelling first 24 hours, resolving over a few days; still dark black and blue today, 8 days later.

                                                I did not get the adverse reaction until day eight. Then at the injection site I had  approximately a 3 inch welt. It was hot and red and itched tremendously. It remained for approximately two days, and then it subsided. It itches so much that I now have some tiny sores waiting to heal.  I also find the my arm ?cracks? when I raise it.... sort of like a torn rotator cuff.....  this arm had surgery about 5 years ago to repair the rotator cuff.  I did not seek medical attention.

                                                At 10 pm after receiving the injection, pain developed and worsened as night continued to a severe level through to a.m. of next day. The pain radiated down the arm to hand. I was unable to move that arm independently both due to the lameness of the limb and severe pain level when moved by my other hand. 2 Tylenol extra strength were taken at 11pm when pain was developing; 2 more were taken at 4a.m.; 2 more at 9am of Feb 26th. The Tylenol helped alleviate some of the pain, but it was still at a level 8 out of 10 and unable to move it. Pain in the arm receded to about a level 4 Feb 27. Minor soreness was present Feb 28 but functional with 1 Tylenol. No pain March 1 March 2 some pain returned; manageble with 1 Tylenol. March 4 pain and soreness returned to about a level 5 and took 1 Tylenol.

Nest day was okay-just a little dizziness. Third day brought on more symptoms: eyes burning,  little dizziness, neck hurt and I had a feeling like the flu ~ spaciness in my head and Very tired...stayed in bed all day. Next five days were normal. Then on following Wed (a week after the shot) a rash or hives formed around the injection area -was itchy. I felt sleepy &amp; my head had a spaciness again. Stayed in bed all day, napped and this lasted about 10 hrs. This morning I feel better but very dizzy. And the 4&#39; circle around injection is still noticeable.

                                                After my vaccination the 28th of February I was very tired and a bit sore at the injection site. I felt much the same on Monday March 1st. I woke up around 12:40 to use the bathroom. I noticed right away that I was having trouble sitting up. It was difficult to swing my legs to the floor. I tried to stand up but my legs would not support me. I tried several times. I woke my husband and told him I was unable to stand. He came over to my side to help me. But there was no possibility of my legs holding me up. I went on my knees and tried to pull myself up with my husband?s help and using the bed frame. My husband went to get our daughter to help and told me to crawl to the bathroom. By the time he and she got back (it was only a few minutes) I was able to sit on the toilet with his help. I could then stand up and with his help walked back to the bed. This hasn?t happened again. On Tuesday March 2nd I could walk ok but it felt like my left knee wanted to give out a couple of times. The last few nights I have had leg and foot cramps which isn?t normal for me. I texted my doctor to let him know these events.

                                                About a week and a half after getting the 1st Moderna  COVID vaccine I develop a rash on my L arm where I got the vaccine. It was about the size of a grapefruit for about 4 days. Itchy slightly raised rash. It went away. Starting about 3 weeks after the injection, my L shoulder and upper arm started to hurt. It has been going on now for about 5 or 6 days. Symptoms have gotten a little worse. Painful to lift my arm to reach for things, difficulty holding anything with any weight. The pain goes from my shoulder down to my bicep. I felt that the pharmacist did the injection to high on my arm. I don&#39;t know if that is why I am having this pain.

                                                When the registered nurse injected me, blood squirted out my arm in a stream.  I thought that was strange.  She asked me if I took blood thinners, I said &#34;No,&#34;  She put gauze on the injection site, held it there and then put a bandage on it.  I told her this has never happened to me before ever when I took any shots in my arm.  She said I would be alright and told me to wait 15 minutes in the parking lot which I did.  That night, I had a slight fever, my arm felt like it was on fire and I had hot and cold chills and couldn&#39;t eat anything or I  felt I would vomit.  I felt the same way the entire next day and just felt  miserable.  I also had problems breathing all day.   I had to use my inhaler every two hours with 3 or 4 puffs.  This went all ALL day and in the evening.  The second day (5th), I felt slightly dizzy and my arm still hurt and noticed a red rash but I could BREATHE finally with no problem!

On 2/21/21 around 12:30 pm I started feeling weak all over, didn&#39;t feel I could move, both arms hurt in the bicep area to the shoulder.  Was cold, tired and ran slight fever, not being able to function to do anything but lay around covered up ,sleeping.  On Monday 2/22/21 I felt some better in am other than having an ear ache and sore throat, by evening my ear was hurting and I was again aching in both arms and weak.  As the week went on I felt a little better each day. I continue even today to get tired easy. Hope not vaccine is not this bad.

                                                I was experiencing a mild RA flare w/ tendinitis going into the vaccine sequence. After 2nd dose my flare worsened to severe within a 9 day period. I had joint, muscle pain, swelling of fingers, hands. I lost much mobility, having gait issues and could not walk unaided ( a first in a flare). I do not take immunosuppressive infusions. Just NSAIDs. My doctor  prescribed a week of Prednisone. I am improving but having to build up strength to stand and walk. My flare continues but is abated. My muscles are weak.

                                                I was awaken at approx 5:00am the morning  following my 2nd Moderna Covid 19 vaccine with my upper left arm severly aching.  The person who gave me the shot informed that if my arm hurt I could use a cold pack and take aspirin, which I did that morning.  Approx 30 minutes after applying the cold pack, I became extremely cold and my entire body shivering.  I wrapped up in a blanket and drifted in and out of sleep for about 5-6 hours, cold and shivering the entire time.  When getting up to get water or use the restroom, my arms and legs were extremely weak and wobbly.  I almost felt as if my legs would collapse under me when walking.  I took my temperature throughout and it was at a normal level.  Around 11:00am, the cold and shivering subsided but then I began to feel warm.  I continued to take my temperature and it was continually climbing until it reached 103.2 degrees before beginning to reduce down.  My weakness and wobbleness also continued and I had a severe headache. I also vomited 1 time.   At approx 7:00pm, my temperature was back to normal and I began feeling a lot better.  I have had no further symptoms since then.

I had fever of 100.3, headache, rapid heart beat and joint pain throughout the night.    Off and on, I iced my arm for hours.  I finally took extra strength tylenol 23 hrs after the injection.  It helped but my fever persisted until Tuesday, March 9th along with headache and arm pain.  On the evening of March 9, i developed a huge red, warm rash all over my upper arm below  the injection site.  It is more than half way around my arm and about 3-4 inches long.  I rubbed benedryl on it and took a Benedryl pill.  It still appears on my arm and is warm and tender on the morning of March 11th.

It&#39;s March 10th, 6 days after and the red rash mark is still there though lighter in color and not raised with just light itchiness. No other side effects now.

After that, it seemed fine.  About ten days later, I noticed that the injection site had become dense and a little sore.  Within a few more days, I started having pectoralis muscle spasms, and I can no longer raise my right hand to my mouth, to my opposite shoulder or overhead.  Trying to make those motions causes me to cry out in pain.  I can&#39;t sleep on that shoulder, and need help getting dressed.  I get acute pain from moving it in other ways, too.

                                                Around 3PM on Saturday March 6, 2021, my right deltoid area became red and swollen with an extremely itchy rash. The area was very warm to the touch. My face was also flushed, but I did not feel feverish. The severe itching continued through Sunday night, lessening on Monday morning. The swelling decreased Monday morning, however, as of today, I still experience occasional itching, the area is still red and the skin feels bumpy to the touch. Monday morning I also experienced vertigo and diarrhea.  This is the first time I have had an adverse reaction to a vaccine.

Swollen tongue and lots of drainage down back of throat with metallic taste, and then a sore mouth and throat.   This lasted 3 -4 days.  did treat with 1 benadryl  each night for  2 nights in a row.   and tyneol in the day.  Swollen tongue was not so I couldn&#39;t breathe but just hurt and &#34;felt big&#34; in my mouth with many bumps where it rested against my front teeth.   itching and small rash on the arm that got the shot (not at the site) (3 to 4 days on this and benadryl helped). and of course a sore arm just for a day.

I received my  second injection covid-19 Moderna vaccine in the Left Deltoid 21 Jan 2021 and within 1-2  hours started experiencing debilitating shoulder pain. I saw an orthopedic surgeon the next day on 22 Jan 2021 - Dr.  He felt the second injection had been in my Left subacromial bursa or Rotator cuff that I was experiencing SIRVA (shoulder injury related to vaccine injection). I was treated with a 5-day steroid taper and subsequent PT.  As of to date I still have pain, limited range of motion and am still going to PT.

On 05 Feb,  prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 031L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Patient was ok at midnight, but when they woke up, they felt very dizzy, were vomiting that day, and experienced extreme tiredness for 3 weeks, now they feel relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired, probably related to not been able to eat on account of having very limited appetite. They mentioned they had limited bowel function, and their bladder felt full, like they could not empty it. Patient states they had a dry mouth from  the beginning of the symptoms.  After a week of these symptoms, on Saturday, the patient went to a clinic and they did some bloodwork and found that the liver enzymes were elevated and 5 more values were not normal and that their kidney function was not normal.  They consulted with their oncologist and they believed these could be an extreme immune response to the vaccine, since the lab work conducted on the 23Dec2020 was normal.  Last Friday they have some blood tests and the values were back to normal.  Treatment for the events included paracetamol and ibuprofen alternating; and  Prednisone.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, dizziness, vomiting, fatigue, dry mouth were relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired.  The outcome events,  urinary retention,  decreased appetite,   and limited bowel function are unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Felt flu like the next morning after second shot ~8 AM (3/7) intense headache, lower back ache, over all achy, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/pressure, chills/sweats off and on, until around 8 PM. Very weak for few days, no appetite. On Thursday 3/11 relapsed with blurry vision around 10 AM, dizziness, intense headache, nausea, vomiting, freezing cold with noticeable body shaking. This was as bad as Sunday and lasted most of the day into early evening. Felt worse than any flu I&#39;ve ever had. Today (3/14) is best I&#39;ve felt since Sunday (3/7).

                                                About 4 hours after receiving my second Covid vaccination, I began to experience chills. Several hours later, achiness began. I went to bed and by morning I felt so sick I could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I slept for most of 14 hours, plus off and on all the next day. then all the next night. I tried not to take any over the counter medication because I had heard or read conflicting information as to the effect of these medications on the vaccine. However by 11:00 AM (just over 20 hours after vaccination) I couldn&#39;t stand it any more. I took 1 Tylenol. I began to feel slightly better such that I was able to get to the bathroom and get something to drink. However, I knew exactly when the Tylenol wore off 4 hours later. I took another Tylenol with a similar result. After sleeping all night, I didn&#39;t feel much better by the next morning. At 8:00 AM (just over 41 hours after vaccination) I took 1 ibuprofen. Within an hour, I started to sweat. Within an hour after that I started to improve. Buy the end of that day, I was feeling much better, however still fatigued. The fatigue lasted most of the next week. Please note, I returned to work (online teaching from home) the next day. This didn&#39;t help the fatigue situation.  Other symptoms I noticed included a second round of Covid Arm. The 2nd vaccine was injected into the opposite arm because I experienced Covid Arm in my left arm after my first injection - see Vaers Report Temporary Number dated 2/14/21. I received  my 2nd injection in the opposite arm. This time, the rash appeared much sooner - 3 days after injection, and went away much more quickly (2 days later). This rash was not as itchy, but was also not identical to the first rash. The first time the rash was blotchy and bumpy. The second time it was more of a slightly raised red square blotch. Pictures are available if needed.  Another significant symptom was an increase in congestion and nasal drainage prominent the night after the injection and lasting through the time I began to feel better. Finally, I noticed  a temporary change in taste. Foods I enjoyed before injection tasted super-sweet for about 5 - 6 days after injection. This has resolved.

Extreme pain, like burning nails in my feet and legs.  Had to have someone with me at all times.  I can&#39;t find the words to describe the agony I went through.  Thought I was dying, and wished I would.  Son called priest for last rites.

                                                First injection failed due to syringe malfunction. Vaccine ran down my arm. I felt immediate pain in the area. The second injection was just a slight pinch and was successful. Pain increased over the next few hours and my arm became immobilized. The pain finally subsided about 5 days later and, so far, I have had no more recurring effects.

                                                I received my second Covid shot of the Moderno vaccine at the medical center. I was approached by a technician to follow him. There were three women dressed in what appeared to be nurses clothing sitting behind him, and an assistant next to him. I was told by one of the three women not to pay attention to them that they were observers. Technician prepped and administered the shot into my left arm upon delivering the shot a liquid was leaking down my arm which brought his assistant to be flapping her arms to get the attention of the three women sitting behind that was supposed to be observing him. One of them stood up and approached me grab some gauze and was wiping the area. Technician finished the injection applied a Band-Aid I was told by one of the observers that I didn?t need to worry about anything. To me it appeared that the shot was given too high on the  left arm. It was much closer to the top of my shoulder. By 7 o?clock the next morning I could not move my arm at all. It was the same sensation as having your arm dislocated it would just hang. There was no way to lift it up without pain. The pain continue to be excruciating at times, unable to use the arm painful to sleep. Called the medical center and was told that if I felt it an emergency  I should come in to the medical center. I was told that this is a typical reaction for some patients. I waited two days and went to emergency care. I didn?t get further than the waiting room when I was told by a doctor behind a plexiglass shield when I describe the problem that again this was a side effect. It?s been over 6 weeks now and the pain has subsided somewhat but there is still an issue with my shoulder and movement. I personally feel that the person who administered this injection was not trained properly  and follow up with the hospital that provided the vaccine was not responsible. I want it on record that I have sustained an injury that I feel was due to improper administering  of the vaccine.

I was driving home on the highway and my left cheek on my face felt numb, my jaw felt funny.  I became dizzy and felt like i was going to faint.  My heart rate speed up.  I pulled over on the highway and called 911.  I began to feel better after a few minutes.  They sent an ambulance who took my blood pressure and pulse and said they were normal.  The episode came on very quickly, it did not last very long, maybe 10-15 minutes.  My concern, should i have the second shot?

Wednesday: My arm started to feel slightly sore within minutes after the injection. On the drive home I felt allergic tingling in my body around the chest area on and off for a few minutes.  I had a strong headache that would come and go that evening. An existing itchiness on my scalp from an allergy response to a new shampoo and other products became inflamed with excessive itchiness and redness all over my scalp. I felt light headed, too. Thursday: I woke up to an itchy scalp and tingling on my forehead. I felt very dizzy all day. I still had a strong headache that would come and go. I was lethargic and slept in the afternoon. My arm was really sore. I woke up at 11:30 p.m. very nauseous. I was able to prevent vomiting by laying a certain way in my bed. Friday: I am still dizzy but not as bad as Thursday. My arm felt better today. My body is experiencing a tingling feeling all over. It was a very strange sensation. I still had a strong headache that would come and go.  Saturday: I had strong dizziness all day on Saturday. I felt awful. I called and reported my symptoms to Dr office. Sunday: My face was tingling in the morning. My left cheek felt puffy. My face is sensitive to touch. Monday:  I woke up at 3:30 a.m. and my lips felt puffy but didn?t look puffy. Arms and chest looked a little pink. At 10:20 a.m. my face felt tingly. I was also shaky and a little dizzy. I called the doctor&#39;s office and left a message. Tuesday:  I woke up with a headache and my scalp aching. My face felt tingly. There were some places on my face felt rough (sand papery) to the touch. I was still trembling. I had on and off dizziness. I made an appointment with the doctor for the next day. Wednesday: I had a video appointment with Dr. We scheduled me to have extensive bloodwork done the next day. I continued to experience tingling and trembling through February 27th.  I felt bad for ten days. I have had occasional tingling up to March 17th.

                                                Suddenly, 6 hours after receiving Dose 2 of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine my injection site arm starting hurting.  I took 1000 mg Tylenol and went to bed.  For the next 48 hours I remained in bed with major flu like symptoms:  fever, chills, severe body aches every where, very bad headache and severe arm pain.  I suppose the nausea I felt was due to taking 1000 mg Tylenol every 5-6 hours for 48 hours.  Then as fast as all this came on it all seemed to go away after 48 hours.  It was a long two days since I had major difficulty getting out of bed or caring for myself.

Woke up around 3 am with a slight fever (100 degrees), achy muscles and joints, muscle weakness, dizziness and headache.  Drank a glass of water, put gel ice pack on forehead, back of neck, injection site (very sore.) Went back to bed around 4 am, woke up again around 6, same symptoms, drank some more water and went back to bed again - very tired.  Got up around 9 am, still feeling bad but fever was a little lower - 99.6.  Fell asleep on the couch twice that day, took 1 ibuprofen around 3 pm.  Reduced appetite that day. Fever gone by night time.  Following day, ~48 hours post-injection, only symptom was continued dizziness.  Some dizziness still  on day 3, very slight on day 4.

Numbness and loss of dexterity in both hands, to the point that it took more than 5 minutes to unbutton one button.  Onset with cold; duration of 30-45 minutes. This was on 3/21/21. On 3/22/21 coloration changes returned with tingling in left hand but normal dexterity. Duration approximately 10 minutes but repeated episodes throughout day. Perhaps entirely unrelated to vaccine -- second vaccine was 3/13/21 and nothing like this happened after first vaccine on 2/13/21.

EMT came to put pt back in bed.  EMT came once again and put pt in wheelchair to get her to  a car so she can be taken to Hospital ER.  They did blood work which potassium was low, urinalysis test showed bladder infection, and CT was normal.  Pt released after 4 hours and told to FU w/ her neurologist.  Pt saw Neuro Dr. on 3/17/2021 said she must have had some sort of reaction to the vaccine.

                                                I had been doing really well with my irritable bowel and stomach issues for several weeks, but, the rash on my neck was in a flair up.  I had some flairing  going on with my upper neck and back area and some burning in my upper legs.  I had gone to sleep on Wednesday night and around 3 A.M., I was awakened by a horrible burning sensation in my upper stomach, back, face, neck, and arms.  They felt like they were on fire inside! My left lower jawbone was hurting up around the front of my ear into my cheekbone underneath my left eye.   I took a terribly burning diaherra, chilling, and aching all over.  I could hardly stand to set straight up in a chair , let alone lay down.  This was terribly bad until around 8 or 9 A.M.  It eased up some and I slept for a couple of hours.  It came back intermittantly for the next four days and nights..So much worse at night.  Even though I have issues with burning sensations and diaherra, etc., I have never experienced anything of this magnitude before!  I am afraid whatever was in a flair up within me was magnified times over!

Within a half hour my arm was in a lot of pain and I couldn?t left it. It felt like someone was ripping my skin off very slowly. There was no redness or swelling but is very warm to the touch. Today is 3/26/2021 and it?s still sore but it has eased up a TINY bit.

Continued to drink plenty of liquids for moderate to mild symptoms took acetaminophen if needed.

                                                I am only reporting so that there is a record of outcome for people with MS.  My first shot on 2/25/21 resulted in headache general feeling of not feeling well on 2/27.  My 2nd dose on 3/25 resulted in my insides trembling for about a day, feeling cold but sweating, severe headache.  I have only had this trembling inside feeling one other time and it was when I had food poisoning.  It is like you cannot stop your insides from shaking.   That was only 12 hours after vaccine and lasted all night.  3/26 was still feeling lousy, headache and trembling that came and went, and dizzy off balance feeling.  Which is not unusual for me, but much more intense.   I slept frequently.   3/27 - today I am still having slight headache but feel I am on the mend.  Taking Tylenol for headache the whole time seemed to help.  Just wanted to give input for people with MS.

About a half hour later, tingling began around my mouth then my entire face and labored breathing ( used Ventolin inhaler)and a cough and very sore arm. The next day, Saturday, I had tingling in my fingers in the morning that spread up my arms and my toes up through my thighs along with my face . I took a Benadryl Sat. PM.  By Sunday the tingling intensity decreased. Monday-dizzy when I woke , then okay. Wednesday I saw my doctor. Today , a week later, and I still have tingling. Doctor recommended I take Claritin for 2 days and get the second shot  due April 16th. I am afraid to get it!!!!

                                                About 3 days after the vaccine my daughter mentioned to me that I was not breathing right. It was harder to breathe and I could not even take a shower that I would be out of breath. My daughter checked my pulsox and it was 85. I couldn&#39;t really walk or do anything so my daughter  transported me to ER and lots of labs were done so since my D Dimer was too high they did a CT scan and it showed some blood clots in my lungs. They admitted me because they were concerned with the location of one of them. They did some heart tests too and put me on Eloquis and then sent me home. I stayed for 2 days. Then they scheduled me FUs with a heart doctor and a pulmonologist.

                                                She got her vaccine, and started out with the sore arm, but she was sitting in the bathroom sometime after 11:00 preparing to do a peritoneal dialysis exchange and blacked out.  She grabbed onto the towel bar on the wall and fell hitting her left hip, left ankle and left upper arm.  She does not remember too much after that, but that she was in and out of consciousness until about 12:30 PM Saturday when she remembered being alert but nothing made any sense to her.  Her son came in and found her on the floor, she could not get up, she had a skin tear on her right elbow and she had been incontinent of bowel and bladder.  He started to ask her the orientation questions and got them all wrong, but she knew that she was confused and disoriented.  She could not get up on her own, called the paramedics and they took her to the hospital.  The confusion and disorientation lasted into early Sunday morning 3/28/2021 at about 3:00 AM when she started to answer questions appropriately.  As the day went on things got better, but still exist to this point today 4/6/21.  It was more severe as she came out of the confusion.  She has brain fog, inability to sequence thoughts, a little bit of expressive aphasia.  She had two CAT scans and an MRI that were negative for subdural or CVA&#39;s.  I had urine specimen and blood cultures to rule out a UTI or sepsis and those were negative.  Her kidney labs were normal.  She ABG&#39;s drawn and those were normal.  They placed her on oxygen and she sat for 3 days and then they released her to home.     Today, she is still having the brain fog, still the not able to sequence thoughts, general fatigue.  She is black and blue from shoulder to elbow due to the fall.

                                                Tinnitus (severe) and extreme dizziness with nausea. The worst of it was on 3/8/21 and 3/9/21.  I went to ENT doctor on 3/10/21 and was prescribed prednisone for 2weeks. That steroid had very little effect. I am able to function only if I take over the counter motion sickness pills every day. The tinnitus has not diminished but the dizziness is at manageable levels.

I woke up at about 4AM to use the bathroom and felt my whole body hurting like the last time.  I took more Tylenol and went back to sleep. I slept til about noon and when I got up then, everything hurt terribly. This time more pronounced in back of neck than the last time; could not move head to look up. Also tremendous pain in  left hand area of thumb and right heel of hand. All pain continued until evening, then mostly subsided - except for the hand pains; I definitely still have those though not as bad as they were. (P.S. I&#39;ve had occasional Herpes cold sores since the 80&#39;s  (rarely)  - but since I had Covid in December 2019 and/or the vaccines, I have had 8 outbreaks, one after another (I have one now).

                                                Sudden weakness in both lower legs, unable to walk or move feet, as if my brain could not get the signal to the area. I had bad headache earlier in day. Went to ER and they evaluated for stroke and GBS. Within a few hours, some mobility returned. I could walk slowly, and I was very wobbly.  It took about 5 days for the symptoms to fully pass.

                                                Immediately I could taste a metallic salty taste in my throat. About 1 minute later my throat was burning and itching and I began coughing. The nurses put me in a room with another nurse, gave me cold water and watched me.  5 minutes later I began feeling dizzy and nauseated.  My throat seemed to settle a bit and I finally told them I felt good enough to leave about 45 minutes later.  Around 5 pm  my throat was still burning and throbbing, so I took a benedryl, claritin and a pecid. My head felt fuzzy.  I ate ice cream for dinner because my throat kept throbbing and I was still nauseated.  I went to bed at 6 PM and around 10 PM I woke up with my throat throbbing and burning and I ached all over as if I&#39;d been beaten in my sleep.  I considered using my epi pen, but took another claritin and Hydrocondone instead because I never had trouble breathing and my lips didn&#39;t swell.  The worst was the swollen, itchy, throbbing throat and body aches.  By morning my throat had cleared up, but the body aches and headaches, and fuzzy headed are still with me 10 days later. I feel permanently damaged by the vaccine.

                                                Severe dizziness to the point I was unable to walk or even sit without fear of passing out or falling and had to lay on the floor. Rapid heart rate, nausea, felt like blood pressure was going up a lot.  Afraid I was on the verge of having a stroke. Symptoms hit abruptly with no warning. Were severe for about an hour and then started subsiding.  Gradually felt better over the course of a couple of hours. After about 6 hours, symptoms completely gone and I felt fine.

Woke in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and had horrible vertigo actually bouncing off the walls. Took Meclizine and benadryl for relief.

The patient placed heat, exercised her arm and took oral ibuprofen for 48 hours.  The patient could not lift her arm more than a few inches to the front or to the side.  No swelling, but bruise at injection site.  The injection site bled enough to put a four X four gauze over the site.  The pain subsided at about 48 hours and the patient was able to lift her arm.

Not looking forward to the second shot.

                                                I woke up with a headache, and feeling quite weak. I did not feel like eating, only had liquids all day. The headache was off and on all day. I also found a rash on the right leg on the inside by the knee. I found a small amount of rash on the left leg in the same area as the right leg, but not as much. I also feel dizzy and my balance was not very good.  I felt better the next day.   On January 18th, I found that I still have the rash, my headache is back and I feel very tired. Again found that I did not have much of an appetite and did not feel up to making food for myself. Had liquids and 2 Ensure protein shakes. Then in the evening had a egg sandwich with mayonnaise.

Patient had pain that started in arm where she got shot, then hurt in right leg, and then left leg and arm. Patient passed out at one point, causing her to fall and hit head on bathroom floor. She did not seek any medical attention at that time and has not since her vaccine. She had extreme thirst from 8pm until 3am. She could not sleep due to pain.  Patient was foggy after that for several days, but she is back at work today and feels much better. Patient doesn&#39;t think she had fever. She did have a lot of hot/cold flashes. Patient states she is entering information into the VAERS online system herself since she knows all her symptoms. Patient is wanting to speak to someone that knows about Mold toxicity and if it correlates to the covid Vaccine. She states she had the same symptoms when she had mold toxicity before. States she had a mold toxin dump at that time when she lived in Dallas and was given an IV which caused symptoms to stop.  Patient states she will look up someone if she needs to and does not want the provider to do any leg work. She has several books and has ordered more. When this occurred before, she had hyperbaric oxygen therapy and believes this pushed toxins out of her cells into her body

I was sitting in car the entire timejand I have never felt faint upon receiving shots. On Tuesday evening, approzimately Jan 26, approximately 9PM I began to have chills for several hours, with my teeth actually chattering. Sometime around midnight I was dizzy and had nausea and vomiting - only mucous. Wednesday AM upon arising I had vertigo and dizziness which lessened during the day. This AM Thursday, I have also had vertigo and nausea and will call my internist.

                                                From my diary about the events of yesterday and today:   I will try to relate what happened to me yesterday.   I received my second Covid vaccination a few days ago and perhaps the following is related, but I?m not sure.  I think I felt fine yesterday morning, and decided to scrub my tub. I was mostly finished when I felt dizzy and went to lie down around 1pm.  A friend texted me asking if I was free for a chat, but I wanted to rest a little and did so, texting her when I awoke.  I did feel out of sorts when I awoke, and was aware that I had had some dreams, but texted her anyway.  We agreed to have a call at 2pm.  While on the call, I felt I was struggling with the conversation.  I was trying to tell her of my experiences with a recent part-time job (which I quit) and couldn?t remember names of people I worked with or certain events that I wished to convey.  I still can?t remember names of people with whom I worked, and it was just one week ago that I left.  I suddenly felt really out of it and nauseous, and struggled to tell my friend I needed to get off the phone.  I could not remember her name, to tell her this (and I&#39;ve known her for 40 years)!   The next few hours are a total fog.  I know I was having dreams of a sort, but I was not asleep.  There are maybe 2 hours that I can?t account for. It is most troubling to me that I can?t account for this time, but I know something was happening with my brain and while I was having these dreams or hallucinations, I was not asleep. I remember having to think really hard about what my son-in-law?s name was ? note that I live with this person.  I did not seek medical care, but feel like this information could be related to the Covid vaccine, and may be important to you.  It was my night to cook, and I had a really hard time keeping up.  I did manage to pull most of a meal together, but right before I was done, I needed to call my daughter to finish it.  I was unable to eat anything myself, and only wanted a drink.  I felt really nauseous and unsteady, although my thinking was a bit more clear by this time.  I?m not sure when the numbness in my toes and fingers on one side of my body (right side) started, but as of this afternoon, both are still numb and weak.  It is 1:00pm and I am still having trouble remembering some things, and that few hours of the afternoon from yesterday are completely lost to me.  I have like a shadow hanging above one eye. I am seriously thinking I have had some sort of a neurological event.  As of 3:00 today, my right hand and right foot are still numb, although my thinking seems to be clear.

                                                Heart started racing about 7:00 pm the night of the vaccine until today (I haven&#39;t noticed it today for the first time since the vaccine). The next morning after - so nauseous; and aching all over; so tired I could hardly move as I had joint pain, too. Couldn&#39;t throw up but nausea was there constantly - even when I went back to work on Monday I as still nauseated and still in pain. When I came home from work on Monday the body aches were gone and my leg felt numb. So it lasted a good four days for me.  No treatment except drank lots of liquids and stayed still as I could so nausea wouldn&#39;t worsen. I still ache but that might be because of my ruptured disc.

Woke up so got up to take evening meds and brush teeth. Had vertigo and moderate nausea. While brushing teeth, I fainted. Came around quickly - was on bathroom floor. Took only one of my medications - the one to prevent migraines and went back to bed. Continued with body aches and chills on and off through the night. In the morning I had worsened vertigo and nausea, but this is typical of my vestibular migraines and I think that was what was going on. I called in sick to work, took one of my  pills for treating migraines and basically slept all day. I do not get migraines often - usually

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness.

                                                After receiving the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine the pt. (while walking around in the store with her husband) began to feel dizzy and weak. She came back to the pharmacy area and she was seated and had her blood pressure checked. It was high (194/84) but she reported that she does have high blood pressure and takes her med at night.  She was given a bottle of water, monitored and her blood pressure was checked twice again over the next 20 minutes. It read lower each time she was checked and when it read 156/84 she said she felt fine and was ready to leave with her husband. She also said she was diabetic and had eaten a small breakfast compared to normally. She will be contacted today to make sure she is still feeling ok.

Over next 36 hours fever was between 100-102. Nausea began 48 hours after injection.  It is now Tuesday, almost 4 days since injection and am still dizzy and weak.  Fever stopped yesterday and only light headache today.   My husband also had all my symptoms except a much lower fever.  We are wondering if we could have got a bad batch???  They said to expect 1-2 days of mild discomfort.  This was like the worst flu I&#39;ve ever had.

                                                I have very swollen feet. It started around 2-15-2021 the swelling in my feet. I went to see my primary doctor, and they put me on Keflex 500 mg  for 10 days, it&#39;s now been 8 days &amp; I still have swelling.  I went to Emergency department on Saturday night because both of my feet were so swollen, and I was shivering, and was scared since I live alone. I was there for many hours, &amp; the dr. prescribed Naproxen for 7 days twice a day. It&#39;s a very strong medication, which I don&#39;t normally take. They gave me 1 tablet when I was there, &amp; it seemed to help a bit, so was hopeful it would help.  I&#39;ve now been taking the Naproxen for 4 days, along w/antibiotics for 8 days, &amp; my feet are very swollen today, I&#39;m very concerned. I also have a nodule in the inside of my right hand that I didn&#39;t have before. When I went to the doctor last Wednesday, 2-17-2021, I had so much pain on the ball of my feet, &amp; could hardly walk very far, it hurt so bad just to walk on the ball of my feet, even in my home.  Normally I&#39;m very active, could walk my dog up &amp; down my stairs &amp; around the large complex several times, when this happened it hurt so bad to walk, I would have to stand on my tippy toes, take my dog out, &amp; come right back in, since I work remotely.

                                                I had immediate flushing of my face and chest, slight thickening of my tongue, heart rate dropped some immediately after shot at 9:18.  At 10 a.m. as I was driving home, I had an acute pain in my left jaw.  Stayed for about 10 minutes and then abated.  I have been dizzy since then with arm soreness.  My right elbow swelled up that evening, gone the next morning.

We gave her ice for the back of her neck.  We checked her blood pressure, it was 230/130, pulse was within normal limits.  Pulse ox was low.  An ambulance was called.  She removed her mask and stepped back so that she could breath better and her oxygen and coloring improved.  She said that her lips felt numb, so we gave her some benadryl just in case.  We did not give an epi pen due to her increased blood pressure.  Her blood pressure did start improving but was still high when the ambulance came.  They took her to the ER for evaluation and she will be following up with her pcp also.  The hospital felt that it was just a fainting episode.

                                                The day following the vaccine I was fine until approximately 1:30 p.m. when I suddenly got very, very dizzy, had disequilibrium and began to feel nauseous, and had diarrhea.  The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

By the next morning, I could NOT raise my left arm, put on clothes, or do my normal activities. I took ibuprophen for 3 days to dull the pain. But the pain and the pain and immobility have returned. It feels like the needle must have hit a nerve a bone or a ligament. My fingers tingle sometimes.

                                                An estimation of about five minutes after receiving the Covid19 (Moderna) vaccine, my heartrate increased to around 100 beats a minute (as told to me by Dr. ). My breathing felt a little different but it could have been from wearing two masks for a longer period of time than usual. After ten or fifteen minutes, I felt sort of dizzness and it didn&#39;t feel quite normal around my eyes and forehead. The staff were extremely attentive to me. I probably was there after the shot for 30-45 minutes. Dr.  suggested my symptoms was due to anxiety and out of an abundance of caution, the emergency squad was called and I was taken to  Hospital Emergency Department.

She also had itching of the arm, back, leg; tremor, thirst, and pallaor. She reported symptoms to PCP and citalopram was discontinued next day. On 1/30-31 she felt disoriented at times, intermittent arm soreness, noted small abnormal bruising, hot/cold, off balance, headache, and fatigue.    Since that time, predominant symptoms have been daily headache. Wakes with left posterior dull aching which escalates through the day 5/10 but will become 8/10 if she does not take anything. She is taking ASA in AM daily with second dose around 3PM when headache recurs approximately 5x/week. Sensation in feet has normalized, but she continues to have numbness in left&gt;right hand. She feels off balance with need to specifically concentrate when walking. No falls. She also has persistent abnormal tremor of left finger. When she goes to type, she will press key 3-4 times.

She also could state the month and date of her birth but not her birth year.   When asked what happened She stated she go lightheaded and fell. She couldn&#39;t remember the incident.  She remembered standing felling lightheaded and then she remembers being on the ground with myself and the EMT talking to her. Took HR and BP. We got her to a sitting position on the floor when she was ready. Took HR and BP. Then we stood and sat her in a chair. Took HR and BP and obtained a Glucose. Called her sister to come to the vaccine center. Talk to patient about going to the ED.  The ED doctor who was communicating with EMT requested patient goes to the ED. Patient initially was refusing.

I was ok the next morning, I thought I was going to be alright, then Saturday my temperature went up to 104.6 and I could not get it to go down. was taking Tylenol every 4 hours and it would not go down.  I was shaking so bad. I was trying to do my chores and I could not physically do anything. I could hardly walk, I could not even go get some water. I felt disoriented. It was my own house that I lived for 24 years and I felt disoriented. I could not remember where the kitchen was. It lasted until about 8PM Sunday evening. Then I started feeling like a human again. I was able to walk to the bathroom by myself. My husband made me a bowl of soup that was the first time I ate since Friday. By that time I was coherent, was able to take a shower and around 10PM I went to bed and slept until 8AM Monday morning, I woke up like nothing had happened.

                                                Low blood pressure starting approximately 15-17 hrs hours after vaccination, continuation of symptoms at least 3 days after vaccination. It was challenging to stand on my own, extreme light-headedness, blood pressure wasn&#39;t taken until March 6th. The symptoms were the worst on March 4th, they improved over the past day or so, however when taking blood pressure reading on March 6th, 2021, blood pressure was 110/60 at 8 am, so it is highly indicative that blood pressure was even lower in the previous days. Other accompanying symptoms on 3/4 were headache, low fever, fatigue, sore arm, achiness (expected side effects). Other side effects on 3/5 were nausea and metallic taste (expected side effects). There were no swelling of throat or breathing problems.

                                                Felt fine (with some muscle ache in my arm ) until  approx 6:00 p.m  when a migraine headache started.  I did not take any medication because I didn&#39;t want to undermine the success of the vaccine.  I also experienced  severe chills but at the same time my body felt hot.  As the eve wore on I had a bad stiff neck.  I went to bed with an ice pack &amp;  did not sleep much.  I still had the same symptoms the next day until I finally took 1 Motrin at 2:00 p.m. &amp; another approx 1 hr. later.  Then the symptoms began to lessen.  Did not sleep well Sat eve either - my legs just felt weird.  Finally I felt better around 9:00 a.m.  on Sunday but still somewhat dizzy when moving too  quickly.

                                                After the second vaccine, I started feeling sick about 4 hours later.  Very sick for about 20 hours and extremely sick for 8 hours.  I did not have a fever. I had chills, extreme shaking, aching everywhere, head and neck pain, entire arm pain; it hurt too much to move it, nauseous,, extreme sweats; my clothing and bed were soaked, and  extreme weakness.  The weakness lasted for 8 days.  But, since the vaccine, my head ?feels funny?, kind of a dizziness.  Then, two weeks after the vaccine I started having vertigo.  This was off and on and I did some exercises for vertigo, which hasn?t helped.  Then, today, the dizziness and vertigo are MUCH worse and constant.  I have not been able to leave the house today.  Is it normal to develop vertigo like this after the vaccines?  I?ve never had it before.  I am seeing my doctor about this tomorrow, but thought i should report it and maybe find out if this is to be expected.

                                                An hour after the injection I began to feel light headed, off-balance and somewhat nauseous. In the next half hour, I went to lie down on the floor of my office because the room was spinning and I was extremely nauseous. A doctor in the building checked my vitals and ordered an ambulance to take me to the hospital. The EMTs checked my vital and my blood pressure was quite high. They started  fluids and added Zophran for nausea while in the office. In the emergency room , again my vitals were checked and the  Zophran was beginning to calm down the nausea. I slept for an hour (or two) and the spinning had stopped. I was discharged around 5:15pm.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my 2nd vaccine on Friday and had a little soreness in my left arm.  When I got up Saturday morning  I felt a little dizzy and achy.  This continued during the entire day/night along with chills, warmth, and fatigue.  I took a 1.5 hour morning nap and a 4 hour afternoon nap.  Later I slept 8 hours at night.  I took an acetaminophen twice during the day and drank a lot of water.  On Sunday, I felt pretty much back to normal.  I just had slight dizziness a couple of times.  I reported this to my doctor.

Nurses assessed, administered Benadryl 50 mg p.o. and transported her back into the clinic via wheelchair for observation. Client reported symptom improvement within 30 minutes post onset and was released to home with her daughter 65 minutes post vaccination. Client was instructed per Dr. recommendation, to take a longer acting antihistimine (Allegra or Zyrtec) to last through the day.  Client was cautioned about drowsiness with the Benadryl and additional antihistimine. She was also asked to check her blood sugar when she got home and to monitor more frequently than normal today. Client was contacted at 5:19 pm today and reports that she is doing well. She did not check her blood sugar until 2 hours post return to home and it was 48. Her provider&#39;s nurse and Dr. were contacted during this event.

After the 2:00 bathroom visit I found myself on the floor of the bathroom between the toilet and the shower. I tried to get up but couldn&#39;t and managed to get out of the spot I was in but unable to get up. I continued to try but was unable to. after two hours of moving, trying to get up and resting where I was I managed to get to my bedroom (a distance of under 12feet).  I felt like my muscles weren&#39;t working properly. I called 911 to help me get off the floor and was taken to the closest ER. By 7am on March 12th I was able to get up and walk on my own. Although my arms and legs are bruised I feel much better today.

                                                The volunteer chose a landing mark for the needle which when stuck into my shoulder joint area, hit something, so he immediately withdrew that needle.  He then took a new second needle and chose a 2nd landing mark that was close to the first needle &#34;stick&#34; and delivered the vaccine.  I felt immediate burning  and that continued for much of the day.   The burning proceeded into intense pain.  I returned to the Senior Center at 7:30 a.m. the next morning and reported the error the volunteer made and showed the head nurse the bruise that was high - at my upper arm - and nearly on my shoulder.  The head nurse said it was &#34;high.&#34;   She asked me what I wanted her to do.  I responded that she should report the error and I would like it documented, as I was now afraid I might have endured a shoulder/joint injury.  I also called the health department and the Covid-19 Help Line  and reported the error.  I had two days of intense pain, where I could not physically, not just the excruciating pain, lift my arm.  I emailed an Orthopaedic doctor who specialized in shoulders and made an emergency apmt with him.  I also made an apmt with my primary.  My ortho doctor is treating me for SIVRA, I am on anti-inflammatories, I am having physical therapy on my left shoulder, as there is constant pain.  I am scheduled for return visits to my orthopaedic doctor and this appears to be a concern as far as damage, time course and outcome.  I hope the head nurse DID report the injury to my shoulder area.  She promised to record the event in &#34;my file,&#34;

                                                Headaches, dizziness, sore throat, head pain more on right side, both eyes pressure (soreness), right eye lid dropped for a few minutes I couldn&#39;t lift it, only the right eye heavily twitching, nose pressure pain, inner ear pain (more on right side), teeth and gum soreness, neck pain, chest pain (pressure).  Two severe days ( February 28th and March 1st) and then it gradually got better by end of two weeks.  I&#39;m 96% back to normal today.  Still having occasional slight pains in head, ear, nose and throat.  Advil and Tylenol help.

                                                Woke up around 2 am with stomach cramps, loose bowels, nausea, chills, sweating, dizziness, sore left arm, very shaky feeling.  Went to bathroom for bowel movement, had trash can in front of me in case of vomiting.  Apparently passed out and fell off toilet.  Woke up on floor, on my right side, with very cold chills and sweating.  Finished going to bathroom.  Noticed small cut on forehead, with dried blood, probably from hitting my head on trash can I was holding.  Went back to bed.  Still dizzy, chills, sweating, stomach cramps, nausea, sore arm, and aching all over.  These symptoms persisted for hours.  Finally fell asleep, woke up around 7:30 am, still dizzy, stomach cramps.  Took temperature, normal, took blood Additional information for Item 18: pressure, also normal.  Called office of primary care doctor, not open on Friday, declined appointment with another doctor, left detailed message, and was told they would contact me on Monday.  Went back to sleep, woke around 11:15 am, still nauseous and stomach cramps and dizzy.  Went back to sleep until around 2:30 pm.  Woke up feeling better, still sore left arm, sore stomach, achy and very tired.

It is unknown at this time if what patient is feeling is correlated to pneumonia vaccine that she received on the 10th.  However, patient has been complaining that she feels tired and weak.  Her vital signs are stable.

She noted a history of bee stings and that she has an epi pen at home so was given the shot and monitored for 30 minutes. 20 minutes post vaccine, patient noted she felt dizzy and somewhat disoriented. She noted a dry throat and like her arms and legs felt funny &#34;like jello&#34;. Her husband alerted staff at the vaccination site and EMS assessed her. She said she was told her blood pressure was high for her but otherwise vitals were fine. She denied itching, or shortness of breath or trouble breathing. She actually asked her husband to go home and get her epi pen and he returned with it and was given a dose of epi and sent to the local emergency room for evaluation. She said she felt better by the time she got their but was monitored for a number of hours. She felt completely fine by the time she was discharged. She noted for a few days following the vaccine she felt fatigued and a slightly itchy spot at injection site but that&#39;s it.

The fever (102 degress) subsided, but a continuous headache, varying degrees of dizziness and brain fog (the inability to focus or concentrate) continue uninterrupted. It has now been two weeks since my 2nd vaccination and it is difficult for me to attend meetings or focus and follow up on projects. I continue to experience fatigue, dizziness, pain and stiffness in my neck where it attaches to my head - and low-grade headache. I have NO prescription medications and NO pre-existing conditions. I am taking aspirin or Tylenol or Advil to see if any of them are effective. The neck pain is helped by the over-the-counter pain relievers, but the brain fog and dizziness continue along with a dull headache.

I had to get my cain out and use it the next 4 days. The pain from surgery was almost gone before shot.

                                                Immediately after the shot, I had a very sore arm for about 5 days. But 12 days after the shot I woke up feeling very stiff in my left wrist, the back of my  neck, and both ankles.  The ankles were stiff enough that it was hard to walk downstairs, but I did it. My wrist and ankles are swollen. Initially, my left elbow was tender to the touch in one spot, but that has improved.   I have been taking 220 mg of Aleve every day, which makes all symptoms go away, but they are back the next morning, though they have been gradually getting better.

A few hours after being vaccinated I felt achy all over and got chills so bad I could not write or hold a glass of water I was shaking so bad. I have to lay down with many quilts on my and then the body aches and random sharp stabbing pain started. I live alone and would have gone to the ER if I could drive. By dinner time the next day the chills were manageable and I could walk almost pain free with the deep deep aches all over. It was just like the symptoms I had endured when I had covid. 2nd shot is suppose to be worse -HELP how can I get it and expect to live. Seriously. So disappointed.

Set up CT  which has not been done as of yet.  Prescribed Meclizine but still have dizziness that comes and goes and tomorrow will be three weeks since first dose.  Second dose due on April 1st.  I tend to get Vertigo but this was  not like it there saw MD.  Looking online I saw that this can be a reaction from the vaccine which for whatever reason I never associated it with. Hence the reason I am reporting.

                                                Vaccine 3/4/21. 2nd day extreme tiredness for 2 days; then weak, dizzyish, tremors, blurred vision right eye which is near legally blind, poor concentration, generally poor feeling.  These symptoms went on for 2 weeks, until I had to do my routine lithium level on 3/18/21.  I was toxic at 1.7.  Have been on lithium 40 years and have never been toxic.  My doctor sent me to ER, where they gave me fluids and potassium.  When checked in ER, my BP was 214/87.  I never have high BP - 120/80 is normal.  On discharge, my BP was 194/79.  Saw my doctor ASAP on advice of ER.  My doctor put me on amlodipine for BP which I started today.  He said I had essential hypertension and heart rate is irregular.

                                                Yesterday morning I started feeling dizzy/lightheaded; decided to take blood pressure (140/70); that&#39;s a little higher than usual; sat down with feet up.  Drank water.  Felt a little better.  Began getting  slight headache (never have headaches); arm began itching at injection sight.  Went on with day.  This morning, about 4&#34;30 a.m., before rising, felt lightheaded again and arm hurt.  Slight headache again. Stayed in bed a little longer.  Arm began hurting more especially when trying to raise it.  Injection site felt warm to the touch and felt a knot  at site.  Upon feeling better, got up.  Felt lightheaded again but got up anyway.  No nausea.  Arm still hurts upon trying to raise it but not as much.  I take my high blood pressure medications together at night at bedtime.  I use the Lantnprost at bedtime.

I also had swollen glands in the neck and jaw. One week after the vaccine, on March 10, and again on March 13, I had severe vertigo and headache, (nausea and vomiting on March 13)  Vertigo has lasted intermittently for the past 17 days. My symptoms are now improving after vestibular PT and a doctor visit, and a course of valium. I have never had such  a severe episode and never one that has lasted this long.

I also started feeling like I was going to faint. The redness has spread on my arm but the redness is subsiding. The feeling faint lasted for about 8 hrs. I feel better today. I did not notify my physician since I started feeling better. I took a Zyrtec when I noticed my arm turning red.

                                                Patient presents for pre-syncope and then subsequent development of chest pain. She was in therapy when she had to use the restroom. She was urinating and having a BM when she suddenly felt extremely lightheaded as though she were about to lose consciousness. She did not thankfully lose consciousness, but rather rapidly developed chest pain after this event. She was brought to ED for evaluation. COVID screen in ED is positive. She was infected with COVID in November, 2020. She has since had a negative COVID screen. She is now positive again &gt;90 days after first positive test, thus this will be treated as a new COVID infection. Place in negative pressure room. I am inclined to begin. Remdesivir as patient is always at high risk for progression to severe disease.  11/11/2020 positive COVID-19 2/13/2021 negative COVID-19 3/29/2021 positive COVID

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

                                                I received the vaccine yesterday 1/6/21.  Today, 1/7/21, I went for my walk this morning and felt off balance/swayed to the right a bit at one point. I don&#39;t think lightheadedness precipitated this, but it unnerved me.  I steadied myself and finished the walk without a problem. I checked and surface/pavement was uneven. My temp is 97.5 and I feel fine now but am just a little nervous that is a possible reaction to the vaccine. I had a reaction to the second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine 10 yrs ago, I fainted in early morning hours after getting up to go to bathroom.  I had received the second dose at about 11:30a the day before, and developed flu like symptoms by afternoon with a fever and ended up dehydrated which I think contributed to my fainting at about 3a when I got up to void.  I had a concussion and was treated with IV fluids at the local ED.

                                                Patient appeared nervous upon receiving vaccine. Patient reported trouble swallowing ( has a history of radiation therapy on throat). When asked if breathing was restricted, patient was able to take long breaths with minimal additional effort. Shortly after, patient appeared to be close to passing out (not completely awake and alert), eyes dilated. The pharmacist who administered the vaccine then administered one dose of the epinephrine (Epi-pen LOT:0FM353/eEXP:NOC 21) while the staff member kept the patient stable in her chair. The facility was instructed to call 911. At 11:49 AM (7 minutes later), symptoms began to improve and the patient became more alert. EMS arrived around 12:00PM to take patient to hospital--patient refused and was back walking around the facility 5 minutes later. No further issues were reported with this patient (pharmacist administering the vaccine left the facility around 1:15PM)

                                                Got slightly dizzy as I stood up. Went to sit in observation room.  My heart was beating very fast for about 8 minutes.  Felt a tightness in my chest and had a slight bit of difficulty breathing.  Did not want to tell the monitors.  Afraid to go to a hospital with COVID.  My left hand turned blue and got cold and tingly.  That lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  So did the trouble breathing.  All subsided in 15 minutes.  Went home and took an antihistamine.  Had a light rash on my body.  Consulted with PCP and cardiologist.  They seem clueless.  We all agreed that i need the second dose but what is the antidote.  Cardiologist gave me a beta-blocker to take before the dose but these symptoms all appeared on the severe allergic reaction list.  The heart pounding was the most pronounced symptom.  What do I do?

Had some tingling in lips and tightness in chest, felt light-headed.  Paramedics observed and checked vitals.  Pulse ox was good, chest clear, BP high.  Gave me choice of getting IV or going to drugstore and purchasing benedryl to begin immediately.  Started oral benedryl.  Went home and took 2nd dose.  Redness is subsiding, BP reduced. Still mild light headedness.

                                                It started with my arm hurting, even my fingers on the left arm. Then my temperature began to climb to 101.7 within 20 minutes, accompanied by chills.  I was very cold--freezing hands and feet. Could not get warm. Then headache started. Migraine intensity no matter what position I assumed. My joints began to hurt, every joint --knees, elbows, back, even fingers-- so it was difficult walking or moving. Even my teeth hurt where I had had dental work the precious day.   All I could do safely was lie in bed with many pillows to hold my head up. I was also nauseous, and a bad case of post nasal drip developed. I could not  rest properly all night--I took one baby tylenol  every four hours (my usual dose) but it did not help.  Finally at 8:00 AM the fever began to subside slowly till to 98.7 and the head ached/ joint pains are  slowly dissolving while I am writing this. I normally don&#39;t run fever and the last time I had the flue was 40 years ago! I have never been this sick in my life.

                                                12 hours after injection I became very ill with vomiting, diarrhea, incontinance, severe chills, fever, pain in arm radiating up to the left side of my face. The pain and lightheadedness continued for 48 hours. I tried to take pepto and ibuprofen but couldn&#39;t keep it down.

In  a couple of minutes I felt very light headed.   While scheduling my second dose, I started feeling  strong pressure inside my head.  I didn&#39;t not feel any pain, just a lot of pressure.     When measuring my  blood pressure (usually, in my case,  it is 120 X 80)  I was told my high number was at 178 x 80.   After resting for some 20 minutes, I was fine again and drove home.    I felt a bit strange  for a couple of hours.

                                                On 02-10-21 at 6 PM I started having a reaction when both my ears felt plugged and within a short time noted decreased hearing.  By 9 PM I also had a severe headache with eye pain and dizziness and started to have chills and fever. The chills and fever lasted during the night even with the use of tylenol and ibuprofen. The highest the fever was 100.6. On 02-11 continued with ear problems, headache and eye pain and dizziness. Also at about 10 AM I thought I had an episode of hallucinating when I saw a man walk into our house. When I asked who he was he disappeared. I have had no more episodes like this. This morning I continue with headache and eye pain, dizziness and ear problems. My left arm  at the site is pink about quarter size and itches.  The symptoms are less painful than 02-11-21.

                                                About nine days after my first vaccination, I experienced limited mobility and some discomfort with movement with my left shoulder. Since then I have let it rest from activities but  I have done range of motion exercises as well as strengthening exercises. I have also taken 400 mg of ibuprofen twice daily for about a week. I stopped the ibuprofen approximately a week later but I?ve continue to do strengthening and stretching exercises of my left shoulder with some improvement. I reported this both to my internal medicine doctor whom I have given you her name of as well as my sports Medicine doctor. They agreed with my regime . I still don?t have full range of motion as well as some pain with certain movements with my left shoulder.

Heart rate jumped to 150 and stayed above 125 for several minutes. I could barely walk back to  vaccination area where pharmacist waited with epipen.  I was given water and after a few minutes HR went below 100.  I stayed another 30 minutes and left however I did still feel a bit dizzy.  At about 8 hours post injection got chills and fever of 101.5 and HR remained high (above 102) for at least 6 hours after onset of fever.   Resting HR usually 59 and still remains above 90 at 48 hours.

                                                The day after my injection, at 5:00 a.m. I got up to try to go to the bathroom but felt very dizzy - I had help to get to commode but had to lie on floor to stop from passing out, was sweating profusely.  Did not feel well between 5 and 8 am. I think I had 2 vasovagal episodes during this time brought on by needing to do a bowel movement but I had difficulty not passing out.  After second bowel movement - the dizziness and nausea and sweating subsided.  The rest of the day, I just had minor fever and minor headache.  By the next day I was normal.  I have had 2 or 3 vasovagal episodes in the last 15 years and so that is what I think it was but I assume possibly brought on by the vaccine.  My average sleeping heart rate that first night was 10 beats per minute higher than normal (I wear a Fitbit with a sleep app).

                                                I received this vaccine at a walk-in-clinic, called STAT Med.  About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt nauseated but finally managed to sleep.  The next afternoon on February 23 I became very ill with vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time.  I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

I woke up at 4AM and felt tired so I went back to bed, I woke up again about 7-8AM and I felt tired but I felt okay. Shortly after I developed chills, achy, dizzy, had a headache, sweaty, fatigued, no appetite and my temperature was 99.6. I took Ibuprofen shortly after and 6 hours later I switched to Tylenol. I tired to sleep, but I felt uncomfortable. This morning my fever was broke. I still feel achy , headache, tired feeling, no appetite as of today.  I am getting back to normal but only feel about 80% recovered.

                                                In addition to recognized side effects, approximately 24 hours after injection, I experienced sudden-onset severe pain in my right shoulder that traveled through my biceps and into my elbow. On a scale of 1-10, I?d rate the severity as a 10. This lasted approximately 15 minutes.   Over the ensuing 5 days I had noticeable but tolerable intermittent right arm pain. Then beginning on the 10th day following injection, I experienced sudden and severe right shoulder pain that traveled down my biceps into my elbow again. I&#39;d rate the pain at a 9 on the same scale. This time however, the pain started around 11 pm and did not subside. I tried sleeping but couldn?t. I got up and spent the rest of the night holding my arm to immobilize it, however that did nothing to stop the pain. It was about 5 am when I finally took 50 mg diclofenac and in about 2 hours the pain subsided to a tolerable 4 on the same pain scale.   As the day wore on, the pain increased again to a level 9 without medication so I continued with 50 mg diclofenac every 8 hours over the following 4 days and knocked it back to a level 3. This pain has occurred in my right shoulder, biceps, elbow, forearm and even my fingers and intensifies toward evening. I have been able to tolerate the pain without medication at about a level 3 for the past 2 days. However, I take a 50 mg tab of diclofenac an hour or 2 before bed as the pain intensifies toward evening. This has allowed me to sleep through the night.   In addition to the arm pain I developed muscle weakness in my right biceps about 3 days ago and am unable to lift my right arm above my head. The pain is not what prevents the movement. It?s as though my arm is not receiving the nerve impulse to move. Taking all of this together, I?d say that immunization appears to have triggered Parsonage Turner Syndrome. As I understand this immune-mediated syndrome, several events can trigger it, including immunization. I experienced this phenomenon one other time, approximately 2 years ago but did not correlate it to a vaccination at the time. This time it?s too apparent. I wonder how many other reports you?ve received that are like this and whether the vaccines will trigger the same reactions. I also wonder now whether I should receive a Moderna ?booster? if needed in the near to long term. I have no interest in going through this event a

That night ran fever of 103 pain all through body, chills, couldn&#39;t warm up.  couldn&#39;t eat, just drank water Respiration quick and short. Scary all night long..  Next day fever of 102 aching, bone pain, extreme soreness in arm, couldn&#39;t walk without falling..  Stayed in bed, did not eat, no appetite.  Third day fever broke somewhat in night.  Sweating, fever down to 101, still weak and uncoordinated. Still short of breath just walking.  I had a bad case of Covid-19  in July of 2020 and asked if this would aggravate it.  Was told no.  It actually felt like I had a case of it again.  The pain has been really awful.  I still do no want to eat on the third day.  Still having chills.

Pain in arm woke me up 2x during night, that I went to an Express Care early 1/29, where they thought I had tendinitis.  On 1/30 at 5 AM, right arm pain so excruciating and all fingers in right arm were going numb and very hard to stretch out fingers and pain also went up to my right shoulder. On 1/30, at 6AM went to ER, they were wondering if I had an ulnar nerve compression, then discharged.  Monday night, 2/1/21, I developed blisters filled with white liquid on back of my right wrist, and right arm.  Diagnosed with shingles by Dr. on 2/3/21 in Doctor&#39;s office.

Mid-day, the right side of my tongue became numb.  But not so numb that I could not eat or drink. By evening I started feeling prickly sensation as one does when novacaine is wearing off. Slept throughout the night. Woke on Saturday, February 27, 2021 with less numbness and prickly sensations. Sunday, February 28, 2021, slight numbness near eye, nose and mouth.  I had Bells Palsy in June 2000.

I woke up ~8:30 am and got up to take my shower. While brushing my teeth, I felt like I was going to faint. I made it back to my bed (~10 feet away) just in time, threw myself on the bed and stayed there ~ 4 more hours. I drank water often during that time (that my husband brought the water to me.  At ~1:00 pm  I felt strong enough to go downstairs. I was okay the rest of the day, just tired. The next morning I felt 100%.

I got up at approximately 9:45 am on 2/28/2021 and went in to use the bathroom, After I finished I was washing my hands and suddenly felt a wave of nausea. I gripped the sink and next I knew I woke up on the floor.  I suffered severe bruising from the fall. Only other side effects I had were a slight headache and chills a few hours after this incident.

Patient received her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at 1200 yesterday. She states she was feeling okay prior to 2000. Patient states she then developed numbness to the right side of her head, right arm, and right leg. She called EMS and was evaluated at her home. Patient was hypertensive at the time but was told she did not need to come to the ED. Afterward she took a Benadryl and went to bed. She states the benadryl just made her sleepy but did not improve her numbness. This morning she woke up still feeling numb and called her PCP. The RN she spoke to recommended she come to the ED. She is dizzy but she states this is normal per her baseline. States HTN previously resolved.

                                                At 8am Jan 20th (30 hrs after shot) I woke feeling extremely strong and powered up, very energized and liken the mental energy to feeling like I was on steroids. Went downstairs to kitchen to make a cup of tea and it was then I realized my pulse was going extremely fast (about 180bpm). I didn&#39;t think much of it or get nervous, but went to sit down and work at my computer, hoping it would go away, After about 20 minutes I realized it hadn&#39;t slowed down, so I went back to my bedroom to get dressed in the event I had to go to an urgent care or hospital. On the way up the stairs to my bedroom I realized I was getting a bit light-headed.  After about another 10 minutes I decided to lie down and called up a &#34;calming meditation&#34; app to see if that could lower my heart rate. I was able to get my heart rate down to about 125 after the10 minute meditation and it returned to normal shortly thereafter. The second episode was on February 11th. This time I was woken up out of my sleep at 4:45am by an extremely rapid heartbeat. Again, about 180bpm. This time I was a bit frightened. I walked around the house for about 15 minutes and when it didn&#39;t go down  I decided to go out for a walk. I did about a 30 minute walk , I had some tingling in my hands, but by the end of the walk my heart rate came down to about 100 and dropped back to normal shortly after.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:30AM. Around 4:00PM that day I started having severe dizziness. About 40 minutes later I had severe pain in my neck, back, and shoulders. I have had 3 herniated discs in the past and the pain from this was much worse than that pain.  About the same time I felt a headache coming on that just got worse as the night went on. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep, however, the pain was so great that I could not lay down flat or sit up. I spent the night walking the floor. During the night I vomited several times. I also developed jaw pain, earaches, and a sore throat.  But the worse part was that during the night I started to feel the sensation of pins and needles being thrust into my legs, ankles, arms, and hands. I never did however have a fever. I finally was able to fall asleep at about 5AM and slept for several hours. When I woke up the pain was mostly gone and I was just left with no energy at all so that I could hardly lift my head off the pillow. I stayed in bed the entire day and the next day I was fine.

                                                About 5 hours after my shot my left arm began hurting way worse than after a flu shot. I have barely slept Sat, Sunday, Monday or Tuesday night because of the intense pain. I couldn&#39;t raise my are at all until yesterday I could slowly raise from my elbow to my hand. Today, 3-10 I can finally raise the upper part of my arm very slowly with some pain. It still hurts constantly but is getting better than it had been. I just can&#39;t sleep because of the pain. I have taken muscle relaxers, tylenol and ibuprofen but nothing helps.

                                                During the evening (after going to bed) started having chills and body felt &#34;heavy&#34;. When awoke the next morning felt fine but noticed slight loss of energy and laying down (not necessarily sleeping) felt better than sitting up.

                                                Jan 14, 2021 1st Dose Moderna COVID19 vac-Rec&#39;d in R-arm. Sore muscle-bearable lasted 4 days. Tiredness lasted 1 day. Vac site swollen, red and itchy-Bearable. Sore muscle and vac site reaction all done by 5th day. Did not take anything for the discomfort. Feb 12, 2021 2nd Dose Moderna COVID19 VAC-Rec&#39;d in R-arm at 1:35p. 1. Feb 12 8:30pm my neck from the base of my skull down to top of my shoulders in pain and muscle spasms severe for a couple of hours. Felt faint until it was over. 2. Feb 12th and 13th The R-arm muscle ached with much pain coupled with soreness all night-no sleep. Did not take anything for this discomfort. No  fever during the night. 3. Feb 13th Muscle left with little movement. Felt like it was going to break if I forced it past its abnormal limitation this morning. Took nothing for the muscle pain. Awoke with dull headache left side of head morning of the 13th. Fever of 99.1. My normal is 97.7. Took nothing for the fever. 4. Fever all day until approximately 6pm. Fluctuated all day long between 99.1 and 100.2; never going lower or higher. Fever broke on its own approx 6pm. 5. Feb 14 No Fever. Felt pretty good. No headache; muscle still very tight and sore but still working with it. Tiredness but went about my daily activities. Took nothing for the muscle pain.  6. Feb 15 No Fever. Over did it on the 14th. Did nothing all day. This is the day the injection site became very swollen red and extremely itchy. Started ice cold compresses to relieve that irritating itch. This reaction lasted thru day 7. By day 8 the extreme itchy and swelling was gone. First day to bed by 7pm. Slept all night until 5am. 7. Feb 16 Day 4 after vac. No fever. I picked up my activity slightly from the day before. Tired. To bed again at 7p. Slept until 5:40am. 8. Feb 17 Day 5 after vac. No fever. Felt real good. Energetic! Had pretty much a normal day yet careful to not over do. 9. Feb 18 &amp; 19 Days 6 &amp; 7 after vaccine. HORRIBLE. Woke up with a splitting headache both days! No fever! The following happened all on the left side of my head and face. a. Left eye left corner painful. No twitching. Tight. b. Left side of face on cheek above where my mandible has been deteriorating since 2016 with associated bone infection that has been subsided since Dec 9, 2020 a blemish appeared. Not a pimple. But a blemish that had opened sometime during the night bled a little and had scabbed over. There was nothing there before I went to bed. c. A BLISTER had formed on top of the left side of my scalp. It was extremely sore. 10. Feb 20 Day 8 after receiving vaccine EVERYTHING was gone as though nothing happened, the splitting 2 day headache, the 2 day painful left eye, and the 2 day painful blister on my scalp. The blemish on my cheek was clear in 3 days from appearing on Feb 18th. Please note that I had not taken any medicine to alleviate any of these side effects. I allowed it to run its course. Also, the last 2 days of side effects beginning on the 18th and 19th  were so severe (to me) I felt compelled to report my side effects. End of side effect reporting.

No need to go to the ER or need of an Epinephrine injection.

Had walked into kitchen to get the thermometer.  My temp was 99. I got very dizzy and passed out for a second or two.  When I hit my head on a cabinet handle I came to.  At first I though I was in my bed and couldn&#39;t figure out what I had hit my head on.  There was blood coming from the wound. My husband came to help me.  We stopped the bleeding after a few minutes and I began icing my head.   I was still very dizzy and had an urge to use the bathroom.  I was afraid to get up. With my husband&#39;s help, I crawled to bathroom and he helped my onto toilet.  I had diarrhea.   At that point I was able to walk with help to my bed. I have had a mild to moderate headache since I had the vaccine.

March 5, about 10AM   Vaccine Shot: Went over allergy/Zyrtec info with pharmacist, she had no concern. Within about half an hour, sinuses filled up, got a bit of a sore shoulder, faint headache, a bit fatigued.  Got through the day fine ?  monthly paperwork, chopped salad veggies, outside to take a short walk twice.  Noon -- ears got itchy, tinnitus increased.   3PM ? sinus pressure has increased.  4:15PM - hands cold and clammy.  6PM ? below waist joints all getting a bit achy and have lots of after-dinner gas. 8PM -- Bedtime will sleep propped up at 45 degree angle, just in case wheeziness begins. March 6 ?4:15AM  up to bathroom at and headache is gone, joints not aching. The Day -- Tired and resting as needed. Did some laundry, dishes, hand sewing on a couple of projects.   Did a couple of short walks again. 8PM -- Bedtime will sleep propped up at 45 degree angle, again just in case wheeziness begins. March 7 ?7:15AM woke feeling much more tired. Made some tea and have some light nausea, so holding off on toast.  Put yesterday?s folded laundry away and found myself a bit light-headed and getting short of breath. Tried some yoga breathing, seemed to help. 7:40AM (about 46 hrs. after shot) ? Short of breath, sweaty and cold clammy hands. Hard gut cramps and 2 trips to toilet that emptied my colon. 8:15AM airways/neck feel tight.

Resting with tea, water. 9:25AM ? another round gut cramps and trip to toilet.  By 10AM OK.

                                                Chills &amp; shivering began around 11:00 pm of the evening of the vaccine day and lasted through the night and next morning.  Very bad headache.  Upon rising around 3:00 pm the following afternoon to use the bathroom, feeling very weak, passed out in the bathroom for just  a second or two.  Felt nauseous.  Husband picked me up and put me back in bed.  Registered low fever of 99.6.  Took 2 Tylenol which seemed to alleviate the headache about 50%.   Stayed in bed for balance of day.  The Monday following the Saturday of the vaccine, neck was very sore to the touch on both sides underneath my ears.  Could not lift head without aid.  Remained in bed the balance of the day.  Tuesday morning, felt good enough to get out of bed and resume regular activities but still only about 90%.

                                                My entire upper left  arm and shoulder/neck radiate with pain. I am unable to rotate or flex my arm without severe and radiant pain. My arm is weak and cannot raise, lift or rotate it above the elbow.  Very difficult to maintain sleep with a throbbing arm. I have been taking Alleve and it helps but the pain is still there just milder. Muscles are not sore but something is aching deep in bone/joints. I went to the Kinesiologist who told me the rotor cuff is the issue. He did an pressure point &#34;adjustment&#34; and the pain subsided for a day or two and now I&#39;m back to being in pain during any level of movement again.  I believe that my injection was given too high in my shoulder and caused SIRVA. I even took a picture of where the injection site was given.  If needed I can provide it to you.

RN talked with patient through care giver as patient does not speak English, as well as an on site interpreter.  Patient described feeling &#34;dizzy&#34; and &#34;sleepy&#34; .  patient&#39;s care giver described the patients&#39; history of absent seizures brought on by panic attacks. In this anxious state, patient was tachycardia, hypotensive, and tachypneic.   RN monitored patient as she lost consciousness for about 7 minutes.  in this state, patient was unresponsive with normalized heart rate and respiratory rate.  Blood pressure was measured when patient was out of consciousness and was hypotensive.  Patient began to regain consciousness after about 7 minutes and was oriented to person, but not place or time.  Care giver insisted on not calling for an ambulance and he would take her home.  Patient was given 16 ounces of water and vitals monitored for about 20 more minutes until patient was normotensive and orientedx3 and was discharged to home with care giver.

Laid back down in bed, worse headache she has ever had and does get migraines.   She did have the size of about an egg with a rash on the arm itself.  She was disoriented, had chills and clammy, felt like she wanted to throw up but did not, fatigue.  The intense headache lasted until this morning 3/18/21.   She took 600 mg of Ibuprofen initially and then 500 mg every 4-6 hours of Tylenol, which helped.  The headache is pretty much gone, small fever, able to walk better this afternoon.

Notified primary doctor and was told I could take tylenol and that the symptoms should be gone in a couple days. The injection site was warm, red, and swollen.  By tuesday night, my head was worse and all I could do was sleep.  Wednesday, 3/17/53 I felt better and tried to start my day. Within a short period of time, I was dizzy and nausea had started again along with the tiredness. The injection site was still warm, red, and swollen.

Then about a week later I started getting dizzy and nauseous in the morning. Sometimes it lasted all day, sometimes It didn?t. And I also had intestinal distress. This is still going on to this day. I am due to get the second vaccine on March 31. I am very worried about the second vaccine. I am afraid I?m going to get a lot worse, because most of the vaccine reactions I?ve read about have happened on the second vaccine. Mine was pretty bad on the first one. So I need some help on this. By the way I had COVID-19 on Thanksgiving day.

                                                02-11-2021, evening.  Sudden onset extreme left hip pain (total hip replacement 10/2018)  with weight bearing on left lower extremity.  Able to limp with help of furniture to my bed.  No pain if not standing but unable to roll onto right or left side while supine due to extreme pain.  Eventually fell asleep and when I awoke in morning the pain was gone.  Less severe episode early afternoon, 02-22-21 upon getting out of car.  Was able to walk with limp to get into house and sit down.  Within an hour the pain was gone.  My 2nd Moderna vaccine was 02-26-2021.  Thirteen days later (first episode of hip pain was also 13 days after first vaccine) on 03-11-2021, approximately 1:00 p.m., while getting out of the car I had onset of excruciating left hip pain, severe enough I couldn&#39;t stand unsupported and needed crutches to get into house.  After sitting about an hour the pain eased enough that I could walk with  slight limp and by evening, no pain.

                                                The evening of the vaccine, at about 10pm I suddenly was unable to get up from the couch and I had an episode of incontinence.  I had to shout for my husband who was asleep in the bedroom to come help me.  He had me hold onto his neck and he lifted me, transferred me to a chair, pushed me into the bedroom and transferred me to the bed.  Overnight I experienced incontinence again, was still not able to stand or walk and my husband had to help me to the bathroom.  The next morning I was not able to walk and was very tired and weak.  My husband pulled me into a chair and pushed me to the dining room.  I had a small amount of yogurt and after 2- 3 hours needed to go bad to bed and slept to evening.  After waking I was still weak and had not appetite.  During the second night I was able to go to the bathroom unassisted. After three days I was feeling back to normal.

                                                I received my first does of Moderna on March 23, 2021. I had no reaction in the first 15 minutes.   My husband and I left the site and stopped to do some shopping about 5 miles down the road from the site.  I was driving.  When I got out of the car, I immediately noticed that I was unsteady, I thought I was just being clumsy until I walked around my car to help my husband ( I am his caretaker) out of the car but I was collapsing and needed to steady myself against the car and get my way back to the car because of intense dizziness.  When I got back into the car, I asked him if he could make it to the restaurant and get me some water.  He did and I drank a bottle of water.  At this time I felt like I was going to have the runs and throw up at the same time so I drove through the parking lot and used the bathroom at the restaurant.   I was a little dizzy but it was not as intense as when I first got out of the car.  I was able to walk to the bathroom and back out without any difficulty.  I did have the runs but the feeling of throwing up passed.  We got back into the car and waited until I felt safe to drive.  After another 15 minutes I drove home.  During the drive I felt sick again and had to stop in a parking lot and throw up.  After throwing up, I felt fine and drove the rest of the way home.  I was able to make it into the condo with no problem and take a shower.  I felt steady and no longer sick.  I went to bed for a couple hours and then got up and ate some food which I kept down. During the rest of the day, I took it easy.  Today I feel fine.  No headache.  I will write if I  have any other problems.  I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.?  Should I take the second dose?

Later in the evening, I felt feverish and spiked a slight fever of 99.  The following day, my temperature kept trying to climb over 101 so I had to take Advil every 4 hours to fend it off.  In the middle of the night on the second day, I hit 102. I then had serious chills and teeth chattering.  On my second day after the shot, I felt dizzy and very fatigued.  That early morning, another bout of chills, bone aches and teeth chattering.  I broke the fever and chills on the third day.  I had heard the the second shot (which I have not had) is worse than the first.  I had full Covid in November of 2020 and am wondering if my reaction was robust due to my previous illness with Covid.  I am still suffering with dizziness and slight fatigue.

On 02-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced HEADACHE (Headache) and FATIGUE (Fatigue). On 04-Apr-2021, the patient experienced IMMOBILE (Immobility symptoms) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOKINESIA (Unable to move throughout the day and night). At the time of the report, IMMOBILE (Immobility symptoms), HYPOKINESIA (Unable to move throughout the day and night), HEADACHE (Headache) and FATIGUE (Fatigue) outcome was unknown.            Patient asked for guidance for preferred pain relief medication. She was referred to consult her healthcare provider for treatment.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included cholesterol and blood pressure medicines.  Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  The patient&#39;s immobility and hypokinesia events may be confounded by the spinal fusion surgery in her past medical history. The causality for fatigue and headache may be related to the mRNA vaccine.

I was laid down, cold compress. It came in waves over a period of 20 minutes. I was given a few sips of water. When it did not resolve I was taken to the ER and given IV fluids.  The doctor said I had an adverse reaction to something in the vaccine. The chief of Infectious disease thought I had a vaso vagel response.  While I am nervous to get the second vaccine , I will go forward and get it..

On Tuesday I felt tired all day long. At 7 PM, I took a Coke inside the fridge and I noticed and told my husband I was not feeling well. I put the coke in the glass, after I took the glass in my hand and then I fainted. Never in my life I have fainted before. I hit my head in the floor. Now I have some bruise in my face, mainly around my left eye. Feeling a little dizzy,  I am in quarantine I and my husband are staying home all the time. I have my doctor scheduled for next Thursday.

I went over and rolled patient over having her lay face up and then proceeded to ask her questions. We had a staff member called 911 while I was helping her.  I asked her how she felt and she responded and said she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; Her pulse was low (~40 bpm). 911 informed us to lie her down on the floor until EMS arrived which we already had been doing at the time. After getting off the phone with 911, she started feeling better and her pulse returned to a normal rate (~80 bpm). EMS still took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

While waiting for EMS to arrive her pulse was low (~40 bpm), but shortly before EMS arrived on scene her pulse rose to a normal heart rate (~80 bpm). EMS then took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                When I woke up the morning after I received the shot my arm was extremely sore and could hardly raise it without pain. As the day progressed I started having body aches, headache, and some chills. It only lasted for that day and I was fine on 1/22/2021. I have never had a reaction to a shot before so it was worrisome. I am fine now.

That subsided, then I had persistent itching at the injection site.  That subsided but now have large, hard red patch the size of a tangerine at the injection sight that is slightly itchy and tender.  Have been experiencing slight nausea on and off, mostly in the mornings. Six days after injection I was feeling light-headed, dizzy and like I was just going to faint or fade away.  Still have those symptoms on and off, but they are not as strong.

                                                Within 24 hours, the inoculation site became red, swollen and itchy which I expected. After a couple of days it calmed down.  I am reporting the symptoms that began a week - 10 days later . On January  19 or 20 my joints and muscles began to feel more painful that usual. By Friday the 22nd I felt a deep dizziness momentarily and shook it off. By that evening, I developed a fever, with shakes and chills which continued into the next morning. My throat was sore. I was completely exhausted. My joints and muscles felt as though there were little bonfires burning. I decided to go to a walk in ER to at least receive a Covid 19 test to see if I could have become infected . The test was negative as well as the flu test, strep culture and multi-bacterial screening test. My blood work indicated a heightened inflammatory response.  I have gradually gotten better over the course of the last 10 days. I am reporting this as the vaccine is experimental and although the symptoms that I exhibited are outside of the normal period that a reaction would be expected to occur, perhaps there are outlier cases on the curve

                                                Awoke day after receiving vaccination feeling lightheaded and nauseous. Felt faint and had to lie down. Began to experience headache and chills as the morning progressed. Could not work or care for grandchild that day. Started to resolve by next morning.

This kept up until I fell asleep.  I awaken about three hours later and vomited again.  Then went back to sleep. The next morning I was not nauseous or dizzy, but I had a slight fever, under 100 degrees and was very tired.   Did not eat anything until about 6 pm.   My stomach was upset most of the day.

                                                Patient awakened in the morning with pain and swelling in the right knee with marked tenderness laterally and local swelling in the same area.  Over the next 12 hours she developed a moderate synovial effusion of approximately 20 cc with pain in the knee becomeing generalized and had trouble walking and decreased range of motion consistent with the effusion. .  The pain seemed to subside somewhat later in the day but she still had trouble walking.  On the second night of 2/6/2021 she was able to sleep but had continued discomfort, swelling and difficulty walking on 2/7/2021.  The pain became even worse during the night of 2/7/21 and she was unable to sleep.  In the early morning  she took 5 mg hydrocodone and got some relief.. She continued to have pain and swelling through the day.  By the evening of 27/21 she was somewhat better.  The morning of 2/8 21 she awakened with less pain, less effusion, and was able to walk better.  She slept well that night.  On the morning of 2/9/ she awakened with no pain.  The effusion was gone and the knee felt stiff but no longer was painful.  By afternoon she was walking without pain and complaining of slight stiffness.    The only other side effect was pain at the injection sight for 2 days which was mild to moderate.  The R knee never felt warm and was never red.  .  I have an infrared camera and the temps recorded on the right knee were no higher than the left knee.  No other joints were involved and she had no recent right knee injury.  No chills, fever, nausea or other problems.  No headache, No myalgias. No vision or auditory prob.ems.  The sense of smell remained normal.  She is my wife and I was considering getting a CBC, Sed Rate, C-reactive protein and possibly an arthrocentesis and evaluation of the fluid.  Since she improved markedly and quickly no tests were done.  I will report any follow-up problems.   It just seemed very strange to have a painful swollen joint with no redness or warmth that was fairly severe and then almost totally resolve within 24 hours between the 3rd and forth day.  .

A few days after that my blood pressure was going lower than normal and I felt dizzy, so I reduced my blood pressure medication and kept an eye on it. I also had a huge a lump in my arm and my whole arm was sore. It was red and hot to the touch.

I am now reporting that I did develop a fever 102-103; had headache--sharp jabbing pain at right back head before 24 hours passed.  At that time, I took an Alleve and after 4 hours, my temperature went down to 97 and pain in left injection site subsided.  Today is 48 hours later, but left arm still unable to move freely without pain restriction.  I hope this gets back to normal.

I fell on my right side and the bathtub was at my back. When I realized where I was, I knew I still needed to use the restroom; I meneuvered myself slowly and carefully; I did use the restroom and then I carefully went back to bed.

By the time that she looked in her rear view mirror her face was swelling up.   Her face started to burn, fast heart beat, and dizziness.  Her neck started to burn as well.  She looked at the side effects.  She called her doctor and took 2 Benadryl as she recommended, and took a nap.  Her doctor told her to continue taking the Benadryl and to call us to report the reaction.  She still has the swelling and the burning sensation in her face, and is still getting a little dizzy but it comes and goes.  The fast heartbeat comes and goes as well.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

Most people say they don&#39;t even feel it, but I definitely felt the needle  go in and then felt the fluid go in.  By late afternoon, my left arm was very sore .  By  evening, I  couldn&#39;t lift my arm at all  due to pain in  that muscle at the top of my shoulder.  I think by that night but perhaps by the next morning I still couldn&#39;t lift my arm and the pain had gone into my neck on the left side.  After about 36 hrs, it started getting better but it was extremely sore for at least 4 days.   I still have some residual pain in my left arm and the base of my neck on that side.     About 4 days ago, I noticed  a round bruise about the size of a quarter about 1.5 inches away from where I think the shot was administered.  I am not aware of anything that might have caused it, but Im pretty sure it wasn&#39;t where the shot  was administered.  It seems to be growing a bit from when I first noticed it.

When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

                                                After my first shot of Moderna vaccine on Jan 18, I had headache and sore arm for 48 hours.    Then 11 days after shot, on Jan 28, I felt some itching in my right arm which progressed to a large red splotch (5? x 3?) that was hot and swollen.   I put cold packs on my arm, which helped, but the red area, burning/itching lasted 3 days, then went away.   I saw news reports of ? COVID Arm? online.  The pics posted looked like my arm.  These reports said it was not a harmful condition and should not keep people from getting the second vaccine shot.   I did not report this to any doctor. I received my second vaccine injection on Feb. 13.    This time I had some arm soreness, but also had fever up to 101, chills, fatigue for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours of fatigue and lightheadedness.   So far, I have not had a repeat of ?COVID arm.?

I gave her a bottle of water and monitored her for 30 minutes. She did say the dizziness went away and felt better. She left after 30 minutes feeling well.

We gave her a bottle of water to drink and crackers and she said she felt better. The tongue tingling went away as well before the 30 minutes ended. Her blood pressure was retaken before she left and it remained in the 140s/100s. She said this is higher than her normal but it could be due to anxiety.

                                                Eight days after receiving my first vaccine I experienced soreness in my left arm.  The next day at approximately 4:30 pm  my left hand started to visibly swell and continued to swell for the next several hours until I could barely remove my rings. My right hand started to swell at approximately 5:30pm and by 8 pm both hands were extremely swollen where I could not close them due to pain and swelling.  Into the next morning and for 2 more days I also experienced sore joints in my ankles (no swelling) and extreme fatigue. The swelling started to subside  on the third day (yesterday) and today my hands are back to normal with a bit of joint pain in the fingers. No more fatigue or joint pain in ankles today  (4th day) .  When I received the vaccine on Tuesday, February 16 I experienced about 3 days of soreness in my left arm, very little fatigue and I had chills for about an hour the evening of the 16th.  After those 3 days I felt fine.  Since the vaccine I have stayed home and have not injured myself nor have I been bitten by anything to have caused the extreme swelling of my hands 9 days after the first vaccine.

By 3:00 pm, my entire left lower leg and foot were aching and I was unable to put full weight on it. By 6:00 pm, I was almost unable to even walk. The same level of pain continued through Saturday. I took ibuprofen for the pain. By Sunday, the pain lessened and I was able to walk a little better, but still favoring the left leg. A bit of pain continued through Monday, but I was walking better. Today is Tuesday and the pain is gone and I&#39;m am walking normally.

Just wondering could this have been caused from the vaccine.  It will be interesting what happens after my second vaccine. Vaccine was Moderna as above

IT STARTED OUT WITH ABOUT SIX AND EVERYDAY AFTER, I GOT MORE OF THE &#34;BITE&#34; LOOK.   IT THEN BECAME A LACY LOOK RASH THAT WAS DARK RED AND COVERED HALF OF MY LOWER LEG,  FROM MY SHIN TO MY CALF.  IT WAS ABOUT AN INCH OR SO UP FROM MY ANKLE AND A COUPLE INCHES FROM MY KNEE.  THIS RASH DID NOT EVER ITCH OR BURN AT ALL.  ITHE RASH WAS  GETTING WORSE SO I WENT TO A DERMATOLOGIST.   SUBSEQUENTLY, I HAD A FEW PALE ITCHY CIRCLES, SMALLER THAN A DIME ON MY ARM AND ABOUT SIX ON MY BACK.  THESE SLIGHTLY ITCHED.  THESE CAME OUT ABOUT WAS ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER MY LEG RASH APPEARED.  OTHER THAN THIS,  I HAD A SLIGHT SORE ARM SECOND VACCINE:  FEBRUARY 13, 2021 HAD VERY SORE ARM, STARTING A FEW HOURS LATER AFTER THE SHOT.   THE NEXT DAY, ARM WAS REALLY SORE AND I GOT A BAD HEADACHE THAT LASTED THE WHOLE DAY. AND DID NOT FEEL GOOD.  NEXT DAY, I WAS TOTALLY FINE.  THIRD NIGHT, I DEVELOPED A WELTY RASH ON MY RIGHT UPPER THIGH- ABOUT SIX SPOTS (JSUT SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN A QUARTER)  THAT TURNED INTO RASH THE NEXT DAY.  I HAD A COUPLE WELTS ON MY UPPER LEFT THIGH, AS WELL AND SOME SMALLER WELTS, FOUR INCHES TO THE RIGHT OF MY BELLY BUTTON.  ABOUT ONE HOUR AFTER THESE SPOTS CAME OUT, I GOT VERY DIZZY.  I HAD THE DIZZY OFF AND ON FOR FIVE DAYS.  THE RASH SLIGHTLY ITCHED, BUT NOT BAD.  THESE RASHES BEGAN TO DISSIPATE A FEW DAYS AFTER INITIAL APPEARANCE.     I HAD ANOTHER RASH THAT APPEARED, 19 DAYS AFTER MY SECOND SHOT, WHICH I STILL HAVE.  RED, VERY ITCHY WELTS ON MY COVID ARM. INJECTION - UNDER ARM AND B Y THE INJECTIONS SITE- LARGE BULLS-EYE RASH AND SMALLER HARD BUMPS ON MY ARM AND NOW A FEW ON MY NECK AND AGAIN, ON MY OTHER ARM.  THE ITCHY WELTS CONTINUE TO APPEAR.

                                                7 days after my vaccination my right arm started itching about an inch below the vaccination. I massaged it, it felt warm and the itching stopped withing a minute of starting. The following night about 7 pm, it started itching again, and this time it felt hot, and a 1&#34; high, 3&#34; wide red oval had developed along with an itchy bump on the outer edge of the oval. I quickly found an article from researchers about Covid Arm. It said most such reactions resolved in 2-3 days, so I wasn&#39;t too worried. I iced it, took a half dose of Benadryl, and the oval was barely visible the next day. The dizzyness I had been feeling all week also resolved at the same time the rash did.

                                                This was my second COVID shot. My arm hurt badly the night of the shot.  I woke up in the middle of Thursday night/early morning with chills. Couldn&#39;t stop shaking.  I couldn&#39;t lift my arm past my waste.  Felt awful on Friday and I ended up running 101.8 fever.  I had a headache that day.  The fever finally broke on Saturday and I just felt weak and my arm still hurt. Today, Sunday, I suddenly have a big bright rash at the injection site on my arm, 6&#34;x3&#34;.  During the first one my arm hurt terribly, felt flu-ish, very low grade fever and ended up with &#34;COVID arm&#34; a big rash 8-9 days later at site of injection.

I was feeling really woozy... glad to be home.. I felt fine &amp; happy.. except for the woozy feeling and started feeling loopy...like I had drank a couple drinks..Not thinking correctly..This lasted for at least 4 hrs then less for 2 hrs.. then I went to bed . woke up the next morning foggy headed ,,till about afternoon. along with a verY sore arm  and a huge lump at the inj site ..also it did hurt when I got it..both the needle and going in. The soreness left after 2 days the bump took longer. And I still have a bruise where I got it.  I did learn 1 thing,,DO NOT TEXT AFTER THE SHOT if you feel like this,,,,, didn&#39;t make much sense at all..And I didn&#39;t remember half of what I said till the next day and reread it,, ..Like texting while drinking...ugh. but I didn&#39;t feel bad except for my arm and little headache. I googled and saw where others had the same feeling ...loopy woozy after .

                                                Sunday, the day of the shot, I was quite dizzy a couple of hours after the injection and my arm at the vaccination site was itchy, but no other significant reactions. The following morning I awoke to a very swollen, hot,  red, and rashy-looking upper left arm at the site of the injection. Had a bit of diarrhea twice in the morning. My temperature 100.4 which is 3° higher than normal for me.  Later that afternoon, I got dizzy again so I took my blood pressure and it was 90/59 which is low for me.   I had been eating normally even though I had a feeling of unease.  The most concerning thing was the discomfort in my upper arm and the swelling.  It was very localized and looked as if my arm had swallowed a tennis ball.  Itchy, red, hot, and very tender.  Today is Day 4 and the swelling has subsided but still not entirely gone and it is still quite warm.  I&#39;ve been applying cold compresses and taking some Tylenol.

Rash was gone the next day, to this date, six days later, some itchiness persists where rash was. In particular at night while in bed.

                                                Began with stabbing pain in left shoulder that woke me up every 2 hours all night long. Progressed to massive migraine headache in a wide band across my forehead.  Found fluid pooling in a channel from my armpit past my elbow; rubbed on it and raise arm until it went away. Muscles in left arm stopped working; couldn&#39;t move my arm; put left arm in a sling.  Started feeling like I was burning up with fever, but body temperature was normal 98.8 degrees. Several hours later was having sudden chills and found body temperature had risen to 102 degrees F.  Developed high blood pressure for me. The lymph node in my neck were swelling, armpit tender to touch, and left breast tender to touch too.  Started icing the back of my neck to take down temp. Put ice on my shoulder to try to cool the pain.  I was very frightened and worried that: (1) got sepsis bacterial infection from shot (2) got bad lot of Moderna or (3) Moderna vaccine sat out at room temperature too long and had gone bad.  48 hours after the 2nd dose and after icing, symptoms started to ease.

                                                Severe back of neck pain and head locked up (couldn&#39;t move it up/down/right or left without more extreme pain). This started a few hours after the shot on Sunday a.m. and lasted in great pain till Wed evening.  Today, Thursday, I can move my head/neck almost back to normal with out too much pain, but not completely gone yet. I took Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen for pain, which only took a bit of the edge off, but never took it away.

                                                On March 5th I experienced shortness of breath around 1:30 that lasted for 10 minutes.  I had no other symptoms and it subsided. On 3/9 around 2:30 am I had another episode of shortness of breath that lasted about 5 minutes. I was able to return to sleep. I went to work that morning and had shortness of breath, sweating, and dizziness. I drove myself to the ER where I was diagnosed with an acute saddle pulmonary embolism.   I was admitted and started on IV heparin.  On 3/10, I was also found to have a DVT in my right leg.

On Wednesday, March 10 headache continued, because nauseated, felt lightheaded.  Symptoms/side effects lasted the entire day.  Excedrin did not alleviate headache, which is very unusual for me.  I did not take anything else for the headache and did not attempt to treat the other symptoms/side effects.  On Thursday morning, March 11, all symptoms/side effects were gone.  No recurrence.

                                                The following symtoms occurred within a few minutes after receiving the vaccine as I sat in the waiting room:  1. difficultly breathing  2. fast heartbeat  3. brain fog/dizziness.   These symptoms went away within approximately 5 minutes. The next morning I woke with a slight headache which didn&#39;t last very long. I had significant discomfort in the left arm at the injection site.  It felt like someone had inserted a balloon in the muscle.  It hurt to raise my arm to 90 degrees and above my head.  I became less aware of it about 9:00 pm the following night.  I called my doctor to report the side effects and it was recommended that I take 2 extra strength tylenol.  I still feel some discomfort at the injection site.

I had no respiratory symptoms and no rash or swelling. I was taken to the  ER and released shortly after. I had no other symptoms aside from a mildly sore arm for a day. I have had no subsequent symptoms.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At ~10 minutes into my 15 minute &#34;observation&#34; period post vaccine, I became extremely dizzy and weak; feeling as if I would fall out of my chair.  I gripped the chair with both hands and put my head down between my knees. 2 EMTs that were on-site came over and talked to me; put me into a wheel chair and took me to their &#34;tent&#34; area in the gym and had me lay down on a cot.  They kept me under observation (completing blood pressure, heart rate, pulse-ox, and temp monitoring) for ~1 hour/15 minutes.  I was somewhat recovered, and wanted to go home. They told me I should contact my doctor for evaluation before returning for the second dose, scheduled for 4 weeks out.   An EMT walked me to my car.  I drove myself home.  I continued to experience continuous (but milder) dizziness and weakness for the rest of the day,  mostly recovered by the following morning. (I also experienced typical side effects of soreness at the injection site, starting later that first day; and mild headache and fatigue the following day).

                                                At first nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and achy all over. Temperature was 101.7. About two days later the nausea, vomiting and diarrhea stopped temp went down to 99. Muscle and joint pain increased in severity. I attributed it to Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Syndrome. The pain has continued to spread to areas where I have not had chronic pain or Fibromyalgia in the past. Muscle cramps are now in groin, left shoulder, neck, and shins. All joints are painful and getting worse. Only relief is taking Xanax and muscle relaxers prescribed by doctor. Difficulty walking, I have been using a cane or walker.  Temp 100 at this time

                                                I woke up the next morning after my vaccination with severe vertigo. On my 6th day of Vertigo I started physical therapy. I had it on both sides. It took numerous treatments (Epley  maneuver ) and 2 weeks to get rid of it. I had my 2nd vaccine 3/10/21 and woke up dizzy and nauseous and ended up with Vertigo again. I start physical therapy again on 3/18/21.  Two vaccinations and two bouts of vertigo.

                                                Shortly after receiving her  Covid vaccination, patient complained of a weird taste, dizziness and feeling faint. I monitored the patient closely, checked  her vital signs and everything was normal. Medical history revealed patient has type 2 DM and HTN. I asked patient if she had taken her meds and eaten breakfast (time was 11:15am at this point). She said she took her meds but hadn&#39;t eaten breakfast. I bought her orange juice and a few snacks. In less than 5 minutes after eating/snacking. She mentioned that she was feeling remarkably better. I monitored her for 15 minutes more to make sure she was fully recovered. She was very grateful and felt at ease leaving the pharmacy. I will check on her later.

It didn&#39;t last too long and by the time I told the nurse she checked my pulse and said it was strong but normal. They watched me for 30 min. I felt better, but ever since then I have had flutterings of the heart.  I called my doctor who said it was nerves and to take the second shot. About ten days later I went to Urgent care who did a electrocardiogram and said it was normal, they didn&#39;t catch the flutterings.  They told me it was nerves and to take the second shot. 14 days after the shot I took Claritin D which seemed to calm the heart.  I am taking it every day now, until I&#39;m sure the flutterings are gone.  I&#39;m pretty sure I had an allergic reaction and I will not be taking the second shot unless you can assure me I should. I called my doctor again and was told they weren&#39;t seeing sick people, go to a heart specialist, although they didn&#39;t recommend one.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid last March.  I received my first vaccine March 3 of this year.  I got a temperature of 103 degrees,  I was nourish , my muscles, Joints and bones hurt so much I couldn&#39;t lift myself out of bed without extreme pain.  The chills I got made me literally shake.  My arm where I was given the shot, I couldn&#39;t lift it.  Even the other arm hurt bad.  My mouth hurt, my teeth hurt, my gums bleed for four days after and the teeth hurt too for that length of time.  My stomach was itchy but no rash.  I felt like I had the virus again minus other issues I had when I did have it.   I&#39;m scheduled to receive my second dose March 31 and I&#39;m very very nervous about it.  I don&#39;t think people who had the virus, especially those who had it very bad like myself, should get vaccinated.     It took 2 weeks to recover from all the pain.   HELP!

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Patient presented to ED on 3/14/21 with new onset of inability to walk. Recalls not feeling well on 3/4/21 after receiving her COVID-19 vaccine (1st dose) on 2/21/21.  She began to experience aching over the anterior thigh on the following day that progressed to involve the posterior lower extremity and forearms by Saturday, 3/6/21.  She also began to experience numbness and tingling in the feet and fingers at that time.  The sensory symptoms persisted over the following days in association with lower extremity weakness that culminated in a fall at home on Thursday, 3/11/21.  She was unable to walk without assistance at the time of her presentation.  Initial examination in the ED revealed borderline antigravity lower extremity strength and absent lower extremity reflexes.  A lumbar puncture performed on 3/14/21 revealed protein  218.1, glucose  76, WBC  8, and RBC 1. She was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome and received her initial dose of IVIG that evening. She has noted some interval improvement in lower extremity muscle strength since her admission to the hospital.  The pain that she had been experiencing is less intense, though she is still prone to experience discomfort if she remains in the same position too long.  She is continuing to experience tingling in the feet and fingers.  She is not experiencing any shortness of breath or difficulty with chewing/swallowing.  She is not experiencing any urinary bladder dysfunction.  She is experiencing constipation.

                                                Got the vaccine, and about 24 hours later she started to feel an ache in her front left tooth.  She was wondering if this was due to the vaccine or not.  She was unable to lift her arm as well.  In a couple of hours it was real sore and she kept hitting it with her tooth.  Her upper gum was then tender and could not touch it.  She then could not chew on the front left tooth, and even hurt with touching of her tongue.  As the night progressed more teeth were tender, and the lip was also more tender.  She started to get a headache and then all of her joints were starting to hurt.  The next morning, Friday morning she had no energy at all, just felt terrible.  Her face was now swollen, as well as her upper lip.  That night it was getting worse adn worse and her gums were so itchy and all the teeth on the left side felt loose.  It then reached her jaw and then the swelling went to her eye.  She called her PCP, and put on antibiotics, to take a antihystamine and a steroid.  Told her to go to the ER if it did not gete better.  It was horrible by Monday morning, she went to UC and had an abscess in her tooth.  They put her on penicillin, told her not to take the other antibiotics.  By Tuesday morning the swelling had gone down, and the swelling in the gums were also gone, and the teeth were also better.  The abscess was also feeling better.  She had no issues with her gums and teeth prior to this.  By the time she finished the penicillin she was fine.  She went to the dentist and they could not find anything wrong with her, and informed her that it was proof that the vaccine was doing it&#39;s job.

The legs pain went away in a few days.  I am still experiencing arm pain and have to avoid certain motions.  I had a regular scheduled checkup with doctor on March 17th.  She examined my arm and said it is muscular.  She said to let her know if it doesn&#39;t improve.  So far it hasn&#39;t making me reluctant to receive my second vaccine which is scheduled for March 30.

Went away in a minute or two.  During the day felt a little off, took shower, had dizziness again.  Had to sit down in fear of falling over.  Since then I have  had slight bouts of minor dizziness.  Just an unsure overall feeling that something isn&#39;t quite right. It is now Thursday, still feeling weird.

                                                Arm was sore where shot was given Saturday, 1:45PM March 6. Noticed slight muscle aches that afternoon. By 8PM those effects continued. I went to bed early and awoke in the night with extreme thirst and severe chills. I put on layers and heat was blasting near my head from below headboard.  I had a fever of 104 degrees which went down soon after I removed layers. I recall being very hard to get out of bed when the chills were at their worst so I was in a fetal position to try to stay warm. Sunday, thirst, chills and fever were gone, but I had an intermittent headache, sore arm where shot was given and my other arm!, also muscle aches and tiredness. By Monday, I had muscle aches,  tiredness and light-headedness; Tuesday I had slight nausea and headache a short while, but mainly tiredness. Wednesday, I still had soreness where shot was given, tiredness and light-headedness, but otherwise was feeling better.  I canceled plans Thursday involving heavy physical labor (native plant restoration)  just to rest a bit more. Basically, I had a bouquet of symptoms over several days - grateful not to have had all at once and can only imagine how bad coronavirus must be.

                                                Second vaccine on FRIDAY and left arm was sore later that evening.   SATURDAY I slept a lot.  I couldn&#39;t drink water as it made me nauseated.  I developed a headache in the early afternoon followed by nausea.  Movement nauseated me.  I managed three spoonfuls of soup and one piece of buttered bread. SUNDAY I felt better and was able to finish my soup and two slices of buttered bread.  Still very sore. MONDAY I noticed a slight rash on the left side of my neck that had crawled up to my jaw and ear. It didn&#39;t itch so much as it felt like the sensation of novocaine wearing off.  Also noticed what appeared to be a rash on the back side of my armpit and a hard lump.  I seemed to have some lack of balance - maybe from the rash that had gone into my ear. TUESDAY I noticed the rash had also claimed the right side of my neck and jaw though not as pronounced. FYI: I chose the Moderna because my 95 year old mother was given that vaccine and had only a sore arm - both times.  I figured if I choose the Pfizer and had an adverse reaction she would tell me &#34;You should have chosen the Moderna!&#34;  Well, I chose the Moderna and look what happened!! :-D

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA About 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine she felt dizzy and lightheaded and felt like she was going to pass out.  She is a type II diabetic but they did not have any ability to check her blood sugar at employee health.  Therefore, rapid response team was called and patient was brought here to the emergency department.  Patient notes that she has had a couple of syncopal episodes in the past in her life and has had several near syncopal episodes.  Upon arrival to the ED her blood sugar was noted to be 99.  She is feeling little bit better but still just a little bit dizzy.  She was completely and entirely asymptomatic prior to getting the vaccine shot.  She has not been ill lately.

She is normotensive, not tachycardic, tachypneic or hypoxic.  She has a normal physical exam and normal cardiopulmonary exam.  Lab work-up shows a mild chronic anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.9.  BMP, chest pain panel normal.  EKG was normal.  Patient was kept on cardiac monitoring and given oral fluids.  We then got her up and she was ambulatory without symptoms and without difficulty. Therefore, this appears to be a vasovagal near syncopal episode that has resolved.  Work-up here is negative.  No further work-up is indicated.  Will discharge home, rest, fluids, cautioned her that she might feel poorly for a day or 2.  Follow-up with primary care as needed.  Return for worsening symptoms.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

Started with severe chills, body shaking, achy all over, head felt like it was going to implode, started to sweat and felt flushed.  Woke up my spouse to get me something to take for headache, etc.  Later that morning could hard lift the Arm, felt a golf ball size lump at injection site and warm to the touch. Was in bed 2 days bcuz it exacerbated my MS.  After that the injection site started itching, with redness.  Lump finally getting smaller.  I took a photo of the injection site which has a red circle the size of my hand.

                                                Within a minute or two of receiving the vaccine, I felt sweaty and dizzy.  Got up from the chair and walked out of the office and immediately felt faint.  Made it to the front of the store and plunked down between two potted plants near the entrance.  Sat there with my head down for a few minutes and got up and walked outside to the parking lot still feeling weak and dizzy.  Gave my car keys to a friend who had accompanied me so he could get us home.  After 20 mins in the car, felt fine and that continued.  Only a sore arm hours later.  Wondering  if I should receive second vaccine.

                                                Dizzy,lightheadedness within minutes. Was told I could stay longer if needed but all they had was the same epipen that I had. Was taken home by daughter. Lightheadedness continued and some trouble focusing continued and desire to fall asleep. Took my bp ,it was 85/61.pulse 109.I hydrated with 3 bottles of water and ate olives to increase sodium level. an hour later bp was up to 107/67,pulse 67. I continued to monitor my bp through the next 24 hrs. I skipped my blood pressure meds  for that night and continued with them the next day when my pressure was back to normal range. I did not use my epipen.  Would have gone to ER if I was unable to control my hypotension. I am an RN.

Movement to sit up, roll over caused sharp pains. Walked to another room and legs felt like they wouldn?t support me. Some dizziness. Got back in bed. Pain all over particularly in neck and head. But any attempt to reposition myself in bed caused severe pain centered in my left buttock.  Felt like muscle pain.  By 8:00 a.m. Friday (next day) still had achy, flu like pain.  Took two ibuprofen and had some relief.  Felt progressively better throughout the day. Saturday felt almost back to normal. Never felt feverish.

                                                On 4th day after vaccination, experienced dizziness and very low blood pressure. Normal Blood pressure is around 112/65. Blood pressure during the dizziness event (today) was measured as 97/62. I suffer from Hypertension and take Amlodipine Besylate 10 mg/day, which lowers the BP to normal. I have continued to take the Amlodipine Besylate after vaccination.  I have not has any additional adverse side effects from the vaccination.  Seven hours after the  vaccination on February 4th, blood pressure was measured as 105/61.  On Feb 5th, the BP was measure at 122/72.  On Feb 7th, the BP was measured at 101/63.  The day (February 9th) started with extreme fatigue and the feeling of not having slept well (I had 9.5 hours of sleep).  No other symptoms except the dizziness. SPO2 measured at 98/99 % and PI was 5.4. RR was 19/minute. Oral temperature has been normal at 98.0 (normal for me).

I fell asleep about 9:15 am on 2-13-2021 for about an hour and woke with fever but could hardly move.  I have had body ache from  being sick with flu before but never where I could hardly move.  I could drink but had no appetite that day.  The fever got to 103 at one point .  Eventually the fever broke about 4:00 am on  2-14 -2021.  The site where the shot was administered was swollen  with a rash that spread out about 5  inches long by 3 inches wide.  I had no side effects at all from first dose.

My stomach was queasy.  By the next morning, my joints hurt so much it was difficult to roll over in bed, and all the other symptoms were still there and worse.  I did not have a fever.  I developed a headache.  All I could do was lie in bed; sitting up felt exhausting.  By evening of that day, my joint pain was lessening and my stomach felt somewhat better.  By the following morning, I felt normal, basically.  So in total, about a day and a half of bad reaction.

                                                I have Post Herpetic Neuralgia as a result of severe non-erupting Shingles in 2017 and it is controlled with 300 mg Gabapentin 2x day.  I can be sensitive to touch and fabric throughout my entire back and across my midriff and sides below by bra line.   The sensitivity varies day to day and I live with it.  When I woke up the at 3:30 am the day after the 2nd dose of vaccine my entire back,  midriff and sides were significantly aggravated and it was difficult to move against the sheets in bed.   Today is day 18 post second dose and every day since 2/11 I remain in increased sensitivity and discomfort.  I have to keep changing to one piece dresses after 5 hours of daylight  that just drape over me with no seams.    I have not increased my Gabapentin  dosage (I could but try not to) and in when there are VERY sore locations, applying CBD cream will relieve the pain in 20 minutes.    The pain/sensitivity locations change daily.

I called the doctor and was seen on Wednesday. The doctor has no idea what it was from, the dizzy spells have left but she gave me pills for verdigo if it comes back. I told her I had the shot on 2-18 and was due again on 3-18.  LShe asked me to report back to her if the dizziness returns or after I get the second shot hnd have a reaction.  I just wanted you to know of this. Again last dizzy reaction on 2-22.

By the following Wednesday (9 days after initial dose), noticeable red area around injection site and  experienced pain in the arm at  injection site and shoulder.  Pain continues and I experienced limited movement in the arm with restricted ability to raise arm over head.  Arm movement is better but continues to be painful in the shoulder and right side of neck.  Other than annoying, not too concerned nor do I feel it is necessary to contact my health care provider at this time.

                                                The second Moderna intramuscular injection  felt different from the first injection.  This one hurt when injected.  About 3:15p.m. that same day, I noticed the arm started hurting.  It later became very painful and I had lost strength in the arm and I could not lift my arm.  This was alarming to me and I thought there may have been nerve damage.  The fatigue, fever and headache came the next day and the arm was painful and unusable.  At 2:30pm  on Saturday, Feb. 27th, I took 3 Aleve to relieve the pain in my arm.  I had hoped to not take anything after getting the vaccine, but I could not stand the pain any longer.  I researched online and read about SIRVA.  I thought that was  responsible for the pain.  The Aleve helped.  By Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021, the pain had abated and I could use my arm.  My fever, fatigue and headache had gone too.  My intention in submitting this is to request that more explicit reactions be listed so that someone like me, living alone, would know that this is a possible reaction and to let it run its course.  This caused me undue stress, on top of feeling lousy and being in a great deal of pain, not the mention my fear of never being able to use that arm again.  That may sound like an overreaction, but until you have had a  limb rendered useless, no matter how hard you try to move it, it is frightening.  I would appreciate any feedback on my experience and I would like to know if others have experieinced this too.  Thank you.

                                                Woke up at 4am the next morning with a wave of dizziness.  When I got up around 8 , I was very dizzy and my blood pressure was 174/118.  I called my primary around 8:15am and was instructed to go to their walk in clinic.  When I got there they took my blood pressure , which was high.  They asked why I didn&#39;t take the Clonidine and I replied I didn&#39;t know.  They proceeded to do a EKG.  The PA came back and informed me that it was different from one that was taken in January. He proceeded to call my heart doctor which wanted to see me at 11. The PA also ordered a ct scan of my head at1:30 that afternoon.  I saw the Heart Doctor around 12 {he was delayed}. They took at least 3 EKG&#39;s while I was waiting for him.  He has ordered a stress test for next Thursday.  The PA has ordered a  carotid artery ultra sound for tuesday.    My blood pressure had been normal for the last three months (I forgot to mention).  Yesterday, the 5th of March I was still dizzy, but not quite as bad.  The pa had ordered Mecizine 25mg for the dizziness.

Its not my bed, have a expensive temperpedic mattress that is super expensive and very comfortable.

                                                A few times since getting vaccine # 2,  I experienced a muscle spasm/wave with sudden onset, over my upper body, travelling up my arms to my shoulders. This time today, I was just standing at my kitchen sink not doing anything, and I felt it start. My arms felt like they could not move, and the spasm was felt uniformly in both upper arms, more on the outer areas, then lodged in both shoulders. My hands felt weak and there was a slight tremor in my right hand. It feels like it lasts for a minute or 90 seconds.   This has occurred 2-3 times. Is this unusual?  First vaccine was 1/20, and 2nd was 2/17.

Dizziness started about 10 AM on Saturday morning (2/27) following the vaccination and continued until around 2 AM on Wednesday morning (March 3).

It felt like diverticulitis, which I had once, so I had a liquid diet Sunday morning and afternoon until that evening,  when I returned to solid food 3.5 days after the vaccine.  Fortunately, most symptoms calmed down at 4 days after the vaccine, but abdominal soreness is still present 4&#43; days post-vaccine.

Fortunately I caught her before she hit her head on table.  Seemed unresponsive. but by shaking her I was able to  get her to the couch.  Very unstable.  Upper body was calmy.  Speech and sight were ok.  No severe headache or numbness or tingling.  On verge of calling 911.  She seemed to stabilize and is now resting comfortably on couch.

I am able to function and do my daily routine once I get out of bed.  The dizziness has been extremely bad a few times.  The clock on my table looked like it was moving one morning when I got up.  I feel pressure in my head, but I do have frequent headaches from allergies.   My first shot was Feb. 3rd; the first dizziness started on Feb. 17.  My second shot was March 8th.  Since that date I have been dizzy daily when I get up or lie down. The dizziness is not always extreme.

                                                The first 3 days I had initial nausea, then headache and fatigue.  The fourth day I felt better, then from March 8-March 12 I had nausea, a strange fuzzy feeling in my head, dizzy and lightheaded and fatigue.  I am able to work part-days but as of March 17, I am still having mild symptoms of slight nausea and feeling off.

                                                Problem with injection, not vaccine.  Tech used VERY LARGE and hollow needle.  She had trouble plunging it into  my (left) arm and I could feel it slicing through tissue.  I gasped as the pain was so extreme and it was all I could do to not cry.  Upon withdrawal, she was shocked that I was bleeding -- drops flowing out of injection site down to my elbow.  She had to ask another tech to help her stop the flow and wipe up the blood drips. That night, throbbing pain in my arm kept me from sleeping and I could not raise my arm without pain  for almost a month.   By the next day, I had a large hematoma.  Injection site continued to bleed internally over the next month.   Developed extensive bruising that kept &#34;refreshing&#34; as injection site continued to bleed internally (pooled red blood that would fade to green only to have more red appear).  Bruising spread to approx. 2.5&#34; wide and 3.5&#34; high.  It has been 4.5 weeks and it is still bruised and tender.  Received dose 2 on 3/14 with no issues or pain whatsoever.  I thought dose 1 injection used a defective needle but medical professional I have spoken to think the tech used a blunt fill needle by mistake.  I was shown a series of needles/sizes and identified the blunt fill one.  I will never forget it!  I was advised to get a COVID antibody test 2 weeks after dose 2 as no one can be sure the vaccine didn&#39;t wash out with all the blood.

Vertigo lasted about 12 hours, chills about 12 hours, stomach ache about 12 hours, headache lasted 24 hours.  I did not treat with any over the counter drugs.  Just rested.  Was surprised at vertigo and dizzyness.  Did not read that in reactions to shot.

Also having trouble using the computer - fingers keep being in the wrong place or cannot spell or spelling out the wrong word.  Having to look over this pretty well and hope it is understandable.

                                                Had vaccine and a couple of hours later was very sore at the injection site, and then was very sore the following day and then continued to a lesser extent until 3/11/21.  On 3/6/21 she woke up and had chills, extreme fatigue, no appetite, was kind of wobbly and she slept almost 24 hours.  It was an effort to chew.  Then that evening there was a very faint rash slightly over her shoulder of the same arm, it was not oval, kind of more irregular shaped and was not really itchy.  Then on 3/8/21 for about 1/4&#34; to 1/2&#34; there was a faint pink circle around the injection site and the rest of the rash had traveled down the arm to about 1/2 the size it was before and the underside of the arm/armpit was sore.  She could not tell if there were swollen glands or not.  The very faint rash went until the 9th.  The chills went through until 3/12/21, but the rest of the symptoms were much less, but the fatigue went until about the 12th. There was runny nose and congestion that started on 3/9, and went to 3/15/21, and the chills then restarted again on 3/15/21.  She also had a scratchy throat from 3/12 - 3/15/21.  She could barely function the first 3 days, just pretty much slept all the time the first week.

I WAS FRIGHTENED DURING THE EPISODE. I HAVENT BEEN TO A DOCTOR IN A FEW YEARS SO DON&#39;T KNOW WHO TO CALL. I THINK I AM FINE NOW.

                                                9 hours after receipt of second dose of moderna  shot I started to experience an abrupt onset of severe headache, joint and body aches, I felt very hot but could not find a thermometer, but then had extreme chills and had trouble getting warm, dizziness, nausea, vomiting,, lots of fatigue and weakness. These symptoms were relentless for 48 hours and then I was very tired, weak and felt shakey inside, as if my blood sugar was too low( it was checked and was not low) for about 10 days. I am still tired but all other symptoms have resolved. It was a very intense, scary set of symptoms.

                                                First vaccine on 1/16/2021, I experienced some numbing of my limbs (arms and legs). It was random and typically didn&#39;t last too long (except one time in my left arm that was quite dramatic and I took Bayer aspirin immediately) but was definitely not a normal experience in my body.  After the second vaccine on 2/15/2021, the next day, I had the expected fever (100.1 to 100.9) throughout the next 2-days, along with no appetite, energy, or strength. I expected it to dissipate but by day 3 &amp; 4, I felt even weaker and more exhausted. As the days turned into weeks (5&#43; weeks now), I&#39;ve experienced severe exhaustion needing to sleep most days 9-13 hours, consistent numbness in my arms (con&#39;t next page) and some w/legs, blurry vision, and very unbalanced. I went from walking several miles a day to barely being able to walk a few blocks due to unbalance, weakness and being out of breath. This has gone on for over 5-weeks now. It feels like I am a long-hauler but without having had Covid. I&#39;ve always been sensitive to drugs, expected to have a reaction, but never imagined something like this would go on for so long.   During this period, I had two Covid tests on March 1 and March 10. Both were negative. The week of March 8, I came down with a good old fashioned cold. PCP asked for the second Covid test and chest x-ray (all clear) on March 10. PCP did lab work on March 5. Everything showed as &#34;unremarkable&#34;.

Could not get warm.  I know I was running a fever but was unable to take my temperature.  Some nausea and some diarrhea.  The shaking finally lessened around 2:00am.  The next two days (Saturday and Sunday) I was very light-headed and dizzy.  Saturday I laid flat all day, went to bed early,  Experienced some chills but not as bad as the night before.  Sunday was a bit better, I could sit up in a chair for some periods of time.   Today (Monday) I would describe as what others have said was their reaction - sore arm, some achiness.

I pulled over as I was driving. I got off the interstate and was on the phone with my daughter. She told me to call 911, I put my head down and laid down. The ambulance got there, my daughter was there, and they could feel the skipping of beats. My BP was up, my HR was irregular. I still had the tightness in my chest. The medic said I am going to give you some nitro to see if would help with the tightness. I felt like I was going to black out. Arrhythmia was noticed on the monitor; EMT gave me a jolt of  and it immediately stopped the dysrhythmia. Transported to ER, inpatient overnight. Medical team decided I could go home, set up with follow up appt. Put me on a echo, stress test, HR monitor for a month (caught one episode and it lasted 1 hour in the middle of the night).  *i feel better but once in a while I get the lightheadedness and can feel the skipping.

I was awakened early in the morning by severe vertigo (my eyes were blinking rapidly and the room was spinning violently); I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t lie down without the violent spinning re-occurring.  I was very dizzy and exhausted the whole day, unable to function.  The next day I continued to be very dizzy and off-balance, couldn&#39;t work but better than prior day.  Each day, same symptoms have continued but milder.  I called my PCP on Monday, Jan 11.  He told me it sounded like an inner ear problem, probably unrelated to the vaccine and to call him the next day and report my symptoms.  I did (Tues. Jan 12) and reported dizziness was milder but still there.  He suggested I see an ENT doctor.

Figured this was normal so continued home. For the rest of the that day I felt lightheaded, dizzy and just wonky off and on the entire day. I later felt exhausted, like someone flipped a switch on me, around 3:00 pm and took a nap for 2 hours. After the nap I felt nauseous and like I was going to vomit. I ate dinner and later in the evening, I took some allergy medicine and felt a little better and went to bed.  The next day, Friday, I felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and again felt like I was going to vomit in the morning. I ate breakfast, felt nauseous, started cramping, had diarrhea and was then fine.  No more symptoms after that.  Although my arm is still tender today, Saturday.

During the night when I got up for the bathroom, I was very dizzy.  In the morning, the dizziness, shivers, and the dry heaves were gone.

                                                Woke up at 3 am with the worst chills I have ever experienced.  I can usually do deep breathing or relaxing to calm my chills, but these would not let up.  It felt like my body was being squeezed.  I was finally able to get up and used a walker to get to the kitchen and took 1000 mg acetaminophen.  Without the walker, which I don&#39;t usually use, I was afraid I would not be able to stand up or would stumble due to my shaking.  By 4 am, the shaking had stopped enough for me to lay back down and I was able to get to sleep.  I had a fever of 99.8 when I woke up.  Later that morning it was 100.8.  By that night it had gone down to 98.7 and the next morning it was my normal 97.6 and I feel great.

The pain seemed to be in whole leg and seemed to be muscular and also a lot of pain in hip joint area.  Also was feeling a burning and numbness sensation down my leg.  By 7pm was in bed because it was too painful to walk.  Took 600 mg of Ibuprofen.  This morning the hip pain is better and I am walking ok. I still have burning and numbness mostly in the calf area of left leg. I am also feeling burning and numbness on the left area of my lip. This is an area of my lip where I have had cold sore in past but don&#39;t see a cold sore.

                                                approx 16 hours after I received the vaccine I awoke in excruciating pain. My back hurt so badly I was having trouble walking and both upper arms felt as though they were in a vice. I had been warned that side effects might be significant but this was like nothing I had ever experienced. I spent the next 15 hours in pain and at first I worried that somehow I had gotten the virus. At about 4:30 am the pain disappeared and it was like I had never even experienced it.  I am reporting this because of the extreme pain I had and the odd way it just disappeared with no after effects. I did not seek medical attention because I felt fine by the time doctors offices would have been open.

Just moving my eyes or my head made the room to spin. I had some nausea, but no vomiting. I called my PCP, and he prescribed Meclizine. I took 2 doses 8 hours apart and it made me sleep for the greater part of these 2 days and drowsy afterward. My husband made me jello and pudding to eat while lying down flat in bed. The Vertigo then became less severe and I was bothered by dizziness for the next week.

                                                At 5 am on Friday 2/5/21 I was having chills but I had been sweating and my sheets and pillow case were wet. I took my temperature and it was 99.7 and then I took it again later when I started feeling much worse and my temp at 10am was 101.8. I took Tylenol and I went to sleep. I woke around 12:30pm and I was freezing to death! I had a horrible headache! I had chills and fever. every joint and bone in my body ached. I had a floating feeling in my head. I felt real unbalanced and very strange feeling like I was underwater. I would not have felt safe driving or standing up. I drank fluids, and I took my temperature around 3pm and it was 101.1 and I took more tylenol. I had no appetite. At 6 pm I took more tylenol. I went to bed at 11pm and the next morning I was feeling the same way. I had a low temp of 99. I still had no appetite. I went to bed that night (saturday night) I woke up every hour on the dot feeling very sick. I stayed in bed all day sunday as well. I started feeling better as the day went on. I noticed 2 red circles nickle sized on my arm about 3 inches below where I got the shot. I noticed it saturday and its still there. I feel fine today 2/8/21. its very hot to the touch.

                                                About 2 hours after vaccine my shoulder began to hurt.  Not at the site specifically, but the entire shoulder hurt like it had been pulled from the socket - I cannot raise my arm parallel with my body and could not put behind my back to undo my bra.  VERY painful.  It feels like someone hit me with a baseball bat on my shoulder.  I took tylenol last night and iced, but it didn&#39;t seem to help.  I just took 3 advil and the pulsating pain has subsided but I cannot raise my arm and the pain is still present.

About the 5-6 days later the injection site got red and was kind of warm, that lasted for a day or two. About 02/06/2021-02/07/2021 the vertigo came and then the nausea came,  the following the day after the vertigo came I started throwing up. The vomiting lasted about 2 days, because I stopped eating. I have been drink like chicken broth and liquids.  The same day I started having diarrhea. The vomiting has stopped by as of today I have a sore stomach, diarrhea, and vertigo. I get very scared when I vomit and I get very stiff so maybe that hurt my stomach muscles. I have to hold to the wall or furniture when I walk because the vertigo is so bad.  I can&#39;t take two steps without almost falling.  The last few days I have spent most of time in bed because I am afraid to get up. I can&#39;t drive either due to the vertigo.

At 1:00 p.m. took temp which was 102. Approximately 5 minutes later I had a seizure. My partner who witnessed the event stated I laid back on our sofa, my head turned and my eyes rolled to the right and I was shaking . I was unresponsive. It lasted about 15 to 20  seconds. Immediately after coming out of it I lost my bowels.

The next morning headache began again and started vomiting at 7:45 a.m. thru out the morning until 11:30 a.m.  I could not eat anything , tried eating a piece of toast &amp; after one bite the vomiting began again.  I vomited again at 3:15 p.m.  Tried again to eat white rice and immediately began vomiting again.  On Thursday morning had a slight headache with no vomiting.  Friday I felt OK, just weak from all the vomiting.  Saturday morning I felt Okay, then suddenly I felt dizzy and though I was going to faint.  My daughter immediately told me that she was driving me to the ER because I was pretty dehydrated.  Was diagnosed with dehydration at the ER.

It appears to be spreading circular to the size of a quarter to about the size of a fifty-cent piece.  I had gone to sleep.  I contacted the veteran 24 hour nurse, my best friend, and my brother to tell them my health status.  I had eaten dinner, taken a Tylenol, and went back to sleep before brushing my teeth.

While swollen, the skin on my toes, feet and ankles was very tight and the appearance was bloated and almost the color of red beets. Additionally, the edema was very apparent and frightening, and I could barely walk.  The symptoms had essentially disappeared completely by 07:30 the next morning.

Unable to sleep. Day two, used ice pack to attempt to move the arm, which only wanted to stick next to the body and not move.  Attempts to use the arm were excruciating, so nothing worked on that level.  Continued icing throughout day 2.  End of day 2, took an Aleve and continued to ice the shoulder.  Day three, took an Aleve; no improvement in the morning, then saw some improvement throughout day three, but not to the point of being able to use the arm.  Total focus was on that arm.  Day 4, pain improved to being able to use the arm for small tasks.  Day 5, pain [but for injection sight] gone.  Shot #2.  Effects were entirely different but equally intense.

                                                Woke up at my usual time the day after vaccine. Felt a little warm but not feverish and did not take my temperature. After walking to kitchen to let cat in from garage I stopped at the nearby kitchen sink and began to shake ( I believe just my upper body). I had to grab onto sink to steady myself. Shaking was only seconds long.  Then I must have fainted as I awoke (quickly) on the floor  alongside the cupboards and sliding glass door.  I laid there conscious about 15 minutes till I felt confident I could get up on my own.  As result of fall I bit upper and lower lip on right (no blood just skin injured), must have clenched my teeth because my left posterior teeth were sensitive to cold and I injured my right ankle. After I got up and realized my ankle hurt with pressure I put on a support knee high to control swelling.  Injury seemed to be focused on the ankle bone. I applied ice for recommended 20 on 20 off protocol for most of both 2/25 and 2/26, elevated and took OTC Aleve as directed on package.  Bruising observed from heel, behind ankle bone and front of ankle.   Called PCP, she recommended continue as I have and she will contact me tomorrow, March 1

Pharmacist let me stay until I felt I could drive.  I came home and took Tylenol for headache.  5 hrs later I felt extremely ill with joint pain , fever , dizziness.  Vomiting occured during the night along with fainting.  Next morning drank tea, no food. Slept all day until 5pm.  Slept through night.  Sun. still had extreme joint pain and headache.  Was able to eat a light meal. Today I ate normally, went to physical therapy with a reduced routine.  I still have a headache as of Mon. night. I know these seem like Normal side effects, but these were like having the worst Flu ever.

It has been 4 days since my  vaccine and am feeling myself again. This was my second vaccine.  The first vaccine, I experienced weakness and difficulty walking, but it was no where as bad as the second vaccine.

                                                About 12 hours after receiving the shot, my wife woke up to severe chills and shaking (with teeth chattering).  She advised that she couldn&#39;t even pick up and put on her glasses.  She woke me and I was able to provide her a heating pad that over about 15 minutes reduced the shivering and chills. Her face was so pale that her freckles literally disappeared.  I was ready to call 9-1-1, but she asked me not to (because they would not have let me go with her).  So, I monitored her and gave her two Tylenols.  For the ensuing 24 hours, she ran a 100-degree fever, had slight chills, and took Tylenol tablets periodcially.

Day 17 small pool of lymphatic fluid caused small bulge just below and front of  Covid Arm site (which went from 2&#39; in diameter to oval 2&#34; wide and 4&#34; long by then) Dizziness and itchiness continued until day around Day 25-26 ( always getting less with each day) Started taking Zyrtec under allergist recommendation, now itchiness is gone

On day 5, my left arm began itching (to the point of awakening me from a night&#39;s sleep) and by day 7, a red swollen hot and itchy area about the size of an orange appeared and the skin was very dry and coarse to the touch.  The itching continued for days with the red area increasing in size to encompass about three-fourths of my upper arm.  While the area increased in size, the itching and swelling decreased and  by day 15, it was all gone,  (I took pictures of it on 2/21 and 2/25 to document.)

I waited 3 days and contacted my Dr.  She made arrangements for me to see a Physical Therapist the next day. He made an evaluation and said it was the crystals in my ears were out of line.  He worked on me that day.  The vertigo is now down to just one side of my head if I turn it at the wrong time.  It is worse when I am lying down.  At this time (2 weeks) I feel the PT will be  able to work.  I feel tired thru all of this but every week I&#39;m getting better.

                                                The pain started at 9:00 pm, a 4 on a pain scale of 1-10. By 1:00 am I could not sleep at all; the discomfort had shot to an 8 with a radius of pain around the injection site and arrows of pain that shot down my arm to my wrist and up to my neck. I had lost most of the movement in my right arm. Raising my arm no more than 10 degrees triggered intense pain. I research Covid vaccines and learned that the shot should be administered with the needle going into the arm at a 90 degree angle. My vaccine was administered at almost the top edge of my shoulder! I waited until 8:00 am to take 400 mg of Advil to keep it from inhibiting antibodies. I took more every six hours until this morning when my pain toggled between an 8 and a 9, and it was clear that the Advil wasn&#39;t working.

My right arm is sore around where I got the shot.  I am having some chills. No fever.  By 7:00 pm it is very hard to walk and took 3 Advil.  By 10:00 pm my left is still hurting but I think the pain is less.  3/13/21 - 5:43 am got up and I am able to walk with minimal pain.  7:00am ? I am noticing that the top of inside my mouth (the palate) feels sore.  I am going to try some gly-oxide.  8:15am ? pain in my right leg is getting worse. Taking 3 Advil.  8:30am ? rinsed mouth with Peroxil and then with Gly-oxide.  My leg pain is back this evening but not as bad as it had been before.  3/14/21 ? During the night my mouth was very sore, so I got up to do a rinse with Gly-oxide.  Woke up with a headache.  Took 2 Advil.  My upper arm is sore and I have a redness with knotting.  My leg paid is almost all gone. I think I am going to be okay!

She looked visibly uncomfortable, physically and mentally. Paramedics were called. Patient&#39;s chief complaint was feeling like she was going to pass out, and that her &#34;head felt like it was going to explode.&#34; BP was taken and recorded at 170/90. By then paramedics were on the scene and reassessed her BP, which was 160/90 then. Her glucose was measured in the low 80&#39;s. Paramedics urged patient to go to the hospital to be assessed more fully, which she agreed to. By that time, her face was back to a normal color, though her chest was still red. Patient&#39;s husband was contacted on Sunday, March 14, and he stated that she was in the hospital for 5 hours for a work up and observation, and they told her she had an allergic reaction of some sort but had recovered fully.

                                                Following the vaccine on Saturday feeling weak and had a low grade fever.  On Sunday 3/14/21 morning she was too weak to get herself up, not able to push herself up.  Her husband helped her to sit up but not able to hold herself up, and when trying to walk her legs collapsed and not able to stand.  This was this way all day with pain all over, severe headache.   She had nausea, not able to eat.  She did stay in the bed, and had no control of her balance or body, not able to sit in a chair without slumping over.  This lasted for about 18 hours.  Yesterday, 3/15/21 at 4:30 AM she got up and her husband helped her to go into a recliner.  Her head is so painful and sore.  Today, 3/16/21 she feels better, but weak.  Her stomach muscles and lower back are sore and hurting from trying to pick herself up and trying to get up.  She took one Advil for these symptoms.  The injection site itself is warm and red to touch, but nothing serious.

It went up my neck on the left side, into the gland and into my ear.  I used Flonase once a day for 5 days beginning on 3/6/21.  I was dizzy off and on for about a week, like my equilibrium was affected.  I had this same event occur with the 2015 and 2016 Flu Vaccine.  When my ear &#34;acts up&#34; my doctor has had me use the Flonase once a day for 5 days, even though Steroids can cause Cushing&#39;s symptoms.  My ear is still &#34;stuffy&#34; and the gland in my neck &#34;feels funny&#34;.  Hearing does not seem to be impaired.  I also developed &#34;Covid Arm&#34; on 3/14/20 and reported both events to my doctor that evening - 3/14/21

Feeling very unfocused, chills, sweats, ached all over, nauseous, felt lighted headed, very fatigued and went from sleep to awake every half hour. These symptoms continued for a week then slowly get better. One week from injection my arm became very sore and covered with rash at injection site.  Within the next 2 days I was covered with a rash.  I am still feeling very unfocused and fatigued as I write this on March 17, 2021. I chose not to have the 2nd dose as I am very concerned of having a worse reaction.  I did not ever have breathing difficulties or a fever.

Symptoms progressively worsening. Fell and hit head the following day, denied loss of consciousness. Never had a reaction to vaccine before. No response to first dose. No lightheadedness/presyncope prior to falls.  Came to ED after fall (evening of the day after receiving the vaccine). Found to have elevated troponin. CK elevated, aggressive fluid repletion initiated, determined to be in rhabdomyolysis. Hypokalemic. Patient improved with fluids and electrolytes, determined to be stable for discharge after 2 days.

As a result of vomiting while on Xarelto, both of my eyes became bruised and black and I had conjunctival hemorrhages in both eyes. I was checked by an ophthalmologist on March 15 who said there was no serious damage, just surface bleeding.  Today is March 20, and I still have episodes of dizziness, headache and fatigue.

Fever of 101-102&#43; continued for 40 hours along with muscle (especially calves) and joint discomfort.  I had a bout of being nauseous and I had two soaking body sweats. After the fever broke, I was weak and tired and lightheaded.  It?s now eight days since the vaccine and I have noticed that at times I am searching for a word that I know, but I can?t pull it up in my mind. This has happened one or two times a day since I received the vaccine on March 13.   Seems like a mild neurological side effect.  Hopefully, this strange side effect will end soon.

She still had these symptoms while she was in the store and the following day. She plans to see her dr for her regular appointment on Thursday 3/25,but is going to discuss the adverse events with him. She reported to me on Saturday 3/20/21 that she was feeling better.

Dizziness and nausea have continued for the past week and a half. I&#39;m unsteady on my feet and having difficulty eating normally. I have not seen a doctor since I assumed this was a vaccine side effect.

As patient was rather upset about the bull&#39;s eye rash and the redness/tenderness advised her to seek tx, not sure if she did actually go.

Legs simply would not work.   They were better later in the day, but I&#39;m now using a walker.  Also had chills during the night and had a fever before going to bed.  3/25 took 1/2 hour to get my legs  to lift me off the toilet.  I had not had a problem getting out of bed - using the walker for support.  I simply could not stand up.

He assisted me in getting back into our home, gave me baby aspirin, asked me questions as to his middle name, of which I  just starred back at him. I can remember him asking me questions, and  I was wondering why my brain was not responding.   My gait  had already returned to normal as I could take the steps into our home with no problem.  My brain fog lasted approx 30-35 minutes. He did bring me to our local ER , where tests were negative but I did stay overnight.

Joint pain started after throat dissipated on Friday 2/19/21.  Joint pain was progressive from shoulders for several days, then  knees for a day, then tops of one foot for one night, then it moved to my hands.  I had swelling where I could not close my hands. I had severe and exstremely painful joint pain in  both hands that kept me up at night and unable to pick up things or close my hands.  I used ice packs for some relief. It would sometimes calm down somewhat for hours and I would think it was over and then it would come back . The hand symptoms lasted from 2/23/21  through 3/5/21 when pain began to slowly calm down.  I had one hand that would not close into a fist for one day 3/6/21 when pain was much less. By Sunday 3/7/21 most symtoms were much less with symptoms dissipating all together.  I have had no recurrence since the weekend of 3/6/21 of any symptoms.

                                                Had history of delayed reactions to allergy shots in past and staff administering vaccinations were concerned about whether that might possibly occur with the COVID vaccination. Many of the delay had been 48 to 72 hours.  I didn&#39;t feel like going to the Farmer&#39;s Market and by 2 pm started getting a migraine headache which had be concerned.   I had not had any fever but had had arm pain that I had used a heating pad for.  I ate Saturday.  I started noticing neck stiffness and some difficulty moving my head right and left.  I had migraine headaches from age 13 - 50 with an increase during pregnancy so I knew what they were and  what I had started to experience as the night went on into Sunday was more than I had ever  experienced in my life.  Flat on my back, ice, no intake, tylenol/codeine, nothing did anything and and the intensity kept coming.  I vomited some Sunday evening which usually helps release the pressure, but nothing helped.  I continued to have more difficulty turning my neck from side to side, visual difficulties and excruciating pain.  I had a virtual appointment with my endocrinologist and she was concerned about what was going on and gave me some guidelines lines about managing my blood sugars and suggesting that I be on the Farxiga if I went in the hospital.  I made it through another virtual meeting basically holding my head in my hands.  I canceled all my dental and doctor appointments because of the unrelenting pain and my concern for my driving. I began having some spastic jerking of the head and neck, which with the mask on forced my teeth into my front gums and lacerated the wholes front inside of my mouth. On 3/23 my husband died unexpectedly, I canceled Wednesday&#39;s Funeral Home visit because of my concern regarding driving and the extreme degree of pain.  I could barely move my neck past center.  I was also having mobility issues and my right side was working as well as it should.  Typing and writing were difficult.  My pain level was off the chart.  I had spoken with the doctor and once I did the required things at the funeral home, I took myself to the emergency room.  My pain was coming off the right lower part of my neck, affecting my vision, my appetite, my balance--basically neurologically going downhill on a fast slide since Saturday night. I told the nurse that my pain level was 20&#43;. The Spinal Tap in the ER was negative across the board and the fluid was clear.  IV&#39;s were hung to help with hydration.  Solumedrol and methacarbornol were given IV to deal with the inflammation around the vertebrae and the pain muscle spasms. Ice packs were applied to the front and pack of the neck to not only help with swelling, but with to relieve pain and help with neck alignment.  Blood sugars were a real struggle with all the prednisone on board but were helped some with the arrival of my Frixiga from home. It was the new Neurologist in the practice that looked at my posture, listened to my history and said, I am going to get some X-rays which took all day to do.  The X-rays showed that there had been swelling and shifting to make CI and C2 put pressure on the nerve. There was also a problem with L3.  A second neurologist added a morning dose of Topomax (50mg) which began to show some effect on Tuesday after being in the hospital for 5 days.  These 2 neurologist, along with the one in the ER could not rule out that what I experienced was a delayed reaction to the Moderna Vaccination, particularly as I have had delayed reactions to allergy shots in the past. It was suggested by the radiologist that a MRI be  one for a more definitive brain study as well as a spine study but the doctor on originally was doing much and didn&#39;t pick up on that. I have had to wean off of the prednisone at home which has meant wonderful monitoring of blood sugars. I have had to continue to wear the neck collar and slowly ween out of it.  I have been exhausted--the doctors think some of that may be from the muscle spasms and the fact that it took 4 days before there was a significant decrease in the intensity in the headache.  I still have to focus on posture and my right had gets very tired of the board.   Signatures are still not as  neat as they were but better than they were when I was admitted.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Shellfish allergy, Allergy to chemicals and Arthritis.   On 25-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 22-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE (carotid arteries were bulging / swollen / still having issues head and neck) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required), MUSCLE SPASMS (spasm in neck / both side of neck (carotid arteries) felt like it was been pushed out / still having issues head and neck) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (stiff neck / still having issues head and neck) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required), MOVEMENT DISORDER (could not lift head / still having issues head and neck /  hold her neck to pick it up) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required) and PAIN (pain is not the same as her arthritis pain /still having the symptoms). At the time of the report, CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE (carotid arteries were bulging / swollen / still having issues head and neck), MUSCLE SPASMS (spasm in neck / both side of neck (carotid arteries) felt like it was been pushed out / still having issues head and neck), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (stiff neck / still having issues head and neck), MOVEMENT DISORDER (could not lift head / still having issues head and neck /  hold her neck to pick it up) and PAIN (pain is not the same as her arthritis pain /still having the symptoms) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) X-ray of  neck and head, the result indicated arthritis..     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route) dosing remained unchanged.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   After the 1st dose, the patient woke up on 10-Apr-2021 and could not lift her head. She thought she had stiff neck, she had to hold her neck to pick it up, it felt like her head weighed 100 pounds. It wouldn&#39;t go away, she was having lots of pressure on her head, both side of her neck (carotid arteries) felt like it was been pushed out. She got an appointment with her physician, she was told that she was having spasm in her neck. The physician ordered Prednisone and Diazepam for the muscle to calm down, it was getting better. Not long after she had a scheduled appointment with her heart doctor. She was told by her heart doctor that her carotid arteries were bulging, he would like to order a test but they will have to push hard on it so she should wait to get the test done since they are swollen. She later returned to her primary physician who ordered a X-ray of her neck and head. The result indicated arthritis, which was not a new diagnosis because she had had it for years but the pain, she was having was not the same as her arthritis pain.  Based on the information provided which includes a  temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-092219 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a  temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I have never experienced that sensation before. Every time I changed position or moved my head the swirling happened for five days. The swirling lessened daily afterwards for about 3 more days. I messaged my Dr. But didn&#39;t go to see anyone.

He has a degenerative muscle disease (Inclusion Body Myositis) so is already very weak, wheelchair bound. House is set up with all lift chairs or elevated (Bed, Toilet) so he can get out of them with very weak legs. By mid morning he was not able to use legs or arms at all to get up and had difficulty holding head up (usually no problem). By afternoon temperature went to 103.6. and he ached all over. After 2 - 3 hours with dose of 2 extra strength Tylenol temperature came down to 100.6 and then another hour later he became very sweaty all over body and temp returned to normal. Continued very weak for a few days. Gradually regained strength and back to normal strength for him over 6 days.

The flu like feeling was gone after about 10 hours of sleep and the third day I just have the muscle and joint pain.  Am working through it and trying tai chi.  Tylenol.

Took Tylenol, headache went away and didn&#39;t return.  1/30/2021 (day after injection): 4 PM, injection arm which had been only slightly tender to touch became so sore I could hardly bear to touch it, shoulder and upper arm became very stiff and painful, moving arm even slightly upward or across body was so painful that I could not continue with this motion. This  got worse as day went on. Tylenol helped some but not much.  1/31/2021 (2 days after injection): Still experiencing above-noted pain and stiffness in arm. Also running low grade fever. Took Tylenol which helped. Fever did not return and arm was much easier to move by end of day. All reaction symptoms gone by 2/1/2021.

The swelling was hard in nature.  Also has had diarrhea and vomiting at 2:00 Am this morning.  Got really hot and cold sweaty feel, then turning to chills.  Stomach hurting, breathing was labored, trying to stay calm.  Finally the diarrhea ran it&#39;s course, went back to bed and is very sore all over, especially her arms and shoulders to the point she can hardly use them.  She is now noticing pain in her arms and legs, just hurts all over.    Yesterday she took Tylenol before bed, has not taken anything today.   The vaccine site is still itchy, red, and swollen in a hard way and hurts.

The patient&#39;s medical history included epilepsy.  Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included clonazepam.  On 03 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient was slurring her words and fell into a deep sleep.  It took three individuals to wake her up.  The patient wondered if she passed out.  She felt tingly in her upper right arm and it felt like her equilibrium was off, and legs were heavy.  The patient was very fatigued.    Treatments of these events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, passing out, unsteadiness, slurring words, fell into a deep sleep, tingly feeling in her upper right arm, felt like equilibrium was off, legs felt heavy and fatigue, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71 year old female subject, with history of epilepsy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness after first dose of mRNA1273 (Lot# unknown). Concomitant medication included clonazepam. Very limited information has been provided at this time. Further information has been requested.

                                                Received the vaccine and about 5-7 minutes she felt like somebody put there thumb on the right side of her throat and pushed really hard.  This got worse and worse for about 10 minutes and stayed that way for about an hour.  She was kept for 45 minutes.  Later on it got less and less and by that evening the sensation was gone.  On day 29 2/20/21 of the vaccine she started having really crazy dizzy spells, off balance, blood pressure was going up and having the shakes.  She went to the ER 02/21/21, which they did a lot of testing, and everything was fine.  They did not know if it was due to the virus.  She saw her PCP today 2/24/21 and she said that it could be from the vaccine, but again not sure.  She called the health dept and told them that she was canceling her appointment and advised that she call us to report the incident.   She has also had pressure in her chest, generally overall not feeling well over the last 3 days.

By the next  morning (around 10) I could barely move, ached and hurt everywhere. No appetite. Felt like the worst flu I&#39;ve ever experienced. This went on throughout the night and into the next morning. By 10am on the 2nd day of feeling very sick, the symptoms began to dissipate and by 4 pm I was fine.

                                                About 1 hour and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine I became dizzy.  3 1/5 hours later I developed chills which lastly briefly. The next day I had  huge area on my  left eye on my pupil which lasted for 5 days. I have blue eyes and right at toward the end of the blue I have white deposits.  On  2/24/2021 I went  see an eye doctor Dr. He diagnosed me with &#34;whiss&#34; ring around both of my eyes, and seen spot on my lenses on my left eye.  I started starburst with my left eye, this did not develop until after I received the vaccine.  I have a dot on my right eye now. On 02/26/2021 see another eye doctor Dr., he also said I have deposits around my cornea, acknowledged the starburst effect on the left eye, and noticed the &#34;whiss&#34; ring.  Since I took the vaccine my eyes have become very light sensitive.  The doctors have told me this conditions are permanent, if it gets worse they will have to scrape the eye and have a laser surgery.  I do  not remember when it started but it 2inches by 3 inches, red patch which started at the injection site and went diagonal.

                                                Neurology consult note 2/16: The patient is a 72-year-old woman, who states that last Friday she began to notice a strange fullness and numbness and perhaps a mild degree of weakness in her right leg and came to  Emergency Room.  She was seen by ER doctors.  Diagnosis was unclear.  She was offered admission to get physical therapy, but she did not wish to stay for the weekend and returned home on Friday the evening only to come back to the ER on Sunday, 2 days later with progression of further right leg weakness, right leg numbness and a hint of new left-sided symptoms that had not begun before Sunday.  None of her symptoms involve the arms or face and everything was below the waist.  There was no significant pain.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday and has lost the ability to void.  Her MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine was reviewed by me on the computer monitor and was unrevealing except for mild DJD.  Thoracic MRI scan shows possible spinal cord infarction versus myelitis occurring within the thoracic spine at the dorsal surface of the cord at the T5 and T6 vertebral body levels to the right of midline.  This was a faint finding and not clearly infarct or myelitis and could be artifact.  It appears that she has hydronephrosis on her scans too and now is using a Foley catheter.  She does have a history of high cholesterol for which she takes a statin at home and was taking a baby aspirin a day when the above symptoms occurred. In summary, the patient has a 72-year-old woman, who presents with progressive right lower extremity weakness and now evolving left lower extremity weakness.  This may be related to an autoimmune process such as myelitis or less commonly cord ischemia.  Normally, I would start her on Plavix, but I think she may need to undergo spinal tap tomorrow if MRI scan of the brain and cervical spine are unrevealing.  Patients with mild hyperglycemia can develop a diabetic amyotrophy or lumbosacral plexopathy simply related to diabetes, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Speaking against this would be that her reflexes are intact at both knees at 2&#43; to 3 and slightly brisk, 1&#43; at both ankles and 1&#43; and symmetric in the upper extremities.  We will hold aspirin for today.  Consider LP for tomorrow, but have not ordered as we will try to avoid and hopefully the imaging studies I have ordered will be sufficient.  We will continue to follow.  While admitted to this facility, she was treated with IV dexamethasone 2/14-2/21  She was admitted to an inpatient hospital 2/14-2/23 and discharged to an inpatient rehab unit at a different health system.

The next morning, as I was making breakfast, I felt very dizzy and fell in the kitchen bumping my head. I visited my Doctor on February 23 to look at my injuries. He said I have bruised/broken ribs and a subcutaneous hematoma on my forehead. Before receiving the vaccine, I have never experienced dizziness. I still have dizziness many days later. Also the next morning on February 21,2021, my left arm was swollen at the injection site and red and itchy. This has gone away.

On 2/28, noticed the first skin lesion on my left arm..it looked like shingles..muscular pain increased and now have 8 similar looking lesions...went to doctor and he said that since I had no pain  to the touch of my skin, it likely was not shingles but a delayed reaction to the vaccination.

                                                1st dose 1/29 reaction gave me little dime-sized red bumps all over my body and a lot of itchiness. I had 2 larger brown  places on my body that were oval shaped about 1 inch across and it was crusty and had liquid and blood coming  from it. One was under my left breast and at the base of my spine. I had to get a mammogram because I had brown and bloody discharge from my left nipple. It looked like someone had painted bright red paint around the nipple. Dermatologists said it was mild duct ectasia bilaterally benign, nipple dermatitis, left nipple bloody discharge, and an eczamatatious rash. Right breast had a brown bump on the areola to the side of the nipple. 03/03/21 second dose: Sore arm, Fever of 100.9 next day that lasted all day. fatigue and a headache. I also had dizziness especially when I lie down or get up. fever went down and then I developed a rash on my body that made it look like I was sunburned all over my body. not spots, just redness all over. I felt pretty weird. it was an itchy rash that stayed about 24 hours, then changed into a spotty rash that traveled to my inner arms and inner thighs. The next day it traveled down my legs to my ankles. It went away mostly after a few days. I do still have spots that look like bites that are quarter-sized brown crusty spots. then I have eczema patches on my forehead. Its flaking and itching and is too sensitive to wash with soap. Also, my right eyelid has 3-4 places that has welt on it so much so that I cant see well from the eyelid, and under eye being swollen.

However I felt as though I could not expand my chest wall. So I waited a moment and after 2 attempts I was able to expand my chest wall. This symptom has improved and is occurring less frequent, but it is still there. It feels as though I have to think the process of taking a big breath through. Over the following days I experienced pain in my joints and muscle aches. On day 2 I began to experience severe pain at he old surgical site on my lower back. The pain radiated down my right leg which is the same leg that was involved when I injured my back it got so The pain also went into my right hip. It got so bad that on day 3 my daughter came to stay with me until  I could walk upright and my pain began to resolve.  I was able to walk again by day 4. However, the pain in my leg still is restricting my movement and my ability to stand up and walk again.  I require some assistance to stand from a squat or sitting..

The serious incident was the evening of 3/17/2021 when I completely lost hearing in my right ear. This lasted for eight hours before gradually returning to normal. I called my doctor but did not feel the need to make an appointment.

Got up around 1 AM to go to bathroom- was VERY weak &amp; needed help.  Also while getting to bathroom began to lose control over kidneys and was urinating involuntarily.   Had urge to to go the bathroom again around 3;  30.  This time could NOT walk at all &amp; was once again urinating involuntarily.  Tried to just go back to bed, but did not seem to have any control over my body.  Around 4:30 I got as comfortable as possible on the floor &amp; slept  off &amp; on until around 8:30.  When I woke up I was able with  help to get back into bed. I had continued to urinate involuntarily during the time I was sleeping prior to 8:30.   The symptoms seemed to gradually subside after this point.  Called Neurologist,  thinking that my radiation induced nerve damage was involved in my reaction and she agreed.

                                                Received the vaccine, and at 3:00 to 4:00 her left arm felt like it was in a vice, being squeezed tighter and tighter, and could not lift or move her arm.  Took Tylenol which did not improve any symptoms.  Got headache and had that with the arm in the pain all night long.  Woke up totally drenched by sweating, and went to the bathroom and felt dizzy yelled for her husband and passed out, and her husband caught her while passing out and woke up on the floor.  On the Thursday she was in her recliner the entire day, had nausea, fever, chills, headache, continued with the pain of the arm in a vice, which lasted all day long.  Her husband forced crackers and water down her as she had no appetite either for 3 days.   She felt so fatigued and her head was not clear.  She slowly gradually improved, and yesterday 3/18/21 she feels her head fogginess has improved, and her arm is gone as she has been exercising with a band.  It is a little sore but otherwise fine.  The excruciating pain lasted for 2 full days.   She put some Lidocaine and it possibly helped.  She called her doctor and they told her to exercise the arm, and to take more Tylenol, which she had tried which did not improve anything.

Fell off the couch I was sleeping on and was unable to get up due to muscle weakness. Had my son come over to get me up off the floor.    I&#39;m feeling somewhat better today.  I&#39;m able to walk and get up from a sitting position.  Still feel a little brain scrambled.  Unable  to concentrate long enough to read the paper.

                                                Had only a sore arm after 1st Moderna shot.  Received 2nd Moderna shot on 3/21/21 AM.  Sore arm began at ~8h, chills began ~11 h, achiness &amp; headache ~14 h, shooting pains (mostly to head) began ~17 h ... these side effects continued through the day after vaccination.  After 48 h, the chills/fever were gone, but the head &amp; muscle aches continued (tho diminished), so I took 1 Advil and felt much better that night.  But on both 3/24 and 3/26, I experienced severe vertigo/dizziness/room spinning on awakening and for a couple hours longer; this was accompanied by nausea, headache, some hot flashes and mild chills.  In both instances, the vertigo gradually eased during the day and I felt considerably better by evening.  The dizziness is very unpleasant and disruptive, so I&#39;m hoping it doesn&#39;t return; it?s too soon to know if it will, but I will see my PCP if the problem persists.  Of course, I can?t be sure the dizziness was caused by the vaccine, but it seems likely.    I?ve had many vaccines and tolerated almost all of them very well.  But I had a strong reaction to Shingrix in August, 2019 ? had a huge, red, hot swelling of my arm around the injection site, and very bad chills, fever, muscle aches, head ache (but no vertigo).  Spent ~2.5 days in bed.

Following this vaccine, she was told to wait 30 minutes in case she had any reactions. She had already started feeling abdominal pain, but did not tell anyone. She went home, drank coffee, and was reading the newspaper when she began to experience several episodes of hematemesis. She vomited several times and she started to feel dizzy and was falling at home. Her daughter called EMS and she was immediately brought to the ED. Patient was found to have a significant GI bleed which required intubation for protection of airway, blood transfusion,  left gastric artery coil embolization, and endoscopic injection of epinephrine and cautery to treat.

I went and had breakfast and then i got the chills, then i started sitting up but i felt awful so i went back to bed and dizziness weakness headache, redness around injection site.  My whole left side felt like it was achy and almost like it was numb. I lost bladder control, I had a couple of accidents.  I stayed in bed until next day, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t eat. Got up Saturday, not feeling good, queasy, diarrhea but not as bad as Friday. Every time i would try to do something i would fall asleep. went and had covid test for surgery. Sunday I felt better but not to par. Today i feel the best so far.  Put antibiotic cream on injection site because it was itching, and it is still hard and warm to touch.  Today i have a small cough that I didn&#39;t have before.

I also had ringing in my ears. I felt like I was going to pass out. It scared me.  I put on my brakes and started to pull over but by the time I started to pull over, the dizziness was slowly starting to clear up.  I had a &#34;foggy&#34; feeling in my head for about a half hour after so I went to my friend&#39;s house and sat down and drank some water. Then I went home.  I have had no incidents since then.

I took one imodium, but threw it up almost immediately.  Took another one mid day and it stayed down and stopped the diarrhea.  I vomited three times yesterday, but hadn&#39;t eaten anything to speak of.  Drank only water.  No fever until this morning, 48 hours after the injection, when I had a fever of 99.5, about 2 degrees more than usual.  still nauseous and dizzy, but not as bad as yesterday.  Have not thrown up nor have I had any bouts of diarrhea.  I called my doctor, and she said it could be as long as three days, so I&#39;m just sipping water and hoping for the best.

Patient asked to step outside to get some fresh, cool area. Patient stayed outside for approximately 5 minutes, returned inside and said she was feeling better. Out of precaution, during the remaining minutes on her 15 minute timer, we administered 25mg po liquid diphenhydramine. Patient remained seated for about 5 minutes and then complained of feeling even more nauseated and faint than before. We laid the patient down into the recovery position. No improvement in symptoms. Then administered 10mg IM of dexamethasone. Patient showed no signs of improvement nor worsening of symptoms. Administed 1 epipen into left outer thigh. Patient within 3 minutes began to feel better but chose to remain laying on the ground. EMS was called at 9:50am and were on scene to further evaluate patient at 9:58am. Patient was alert, responding, and reported feeling better. Moved to sitting position. Vitals were taken, Pulse of 77bmp, O2 Saturation of 100%, BP of 113/72. Vital signs were within normal limits. Patient had regained color in her face and her response to stimuli was back to normal when EMS were on scene.

                                                About 24 hours after the injection, I got really sick with aches from the tips of my toes to the ends of my hair. Headache, nausea, pain in all joints and the injection site was extremely sore. It lasted about 6 hours. It was really bad. I have a high tolerance for pain, but this was a level 8 on a scale of 10. The headache lasted two more days. A little lightheadedness and dizzy feelings, but over all good to go and do my daily activities. Friday, 0205/2021, I had major diarrhea and vomiting around 9 PM. Back to normal on Saturday. Today, Sunday, 02/07/2021, I am experiencing itching and burning, with swelling and redness at the injection site and a bit of nausea, with a low amount of diarrhea. I still feel pretty okay with a tiny headache. This entire time from the 6 hours of real pain, I am fatigued and really tired after very little activity. No shortness of breath or coughing though.  I get my second shot on 02/26/2021. I also have my 6 month check up tomorrow, Monday, 02/08/2021 with Dr.

I have never had one but it appeared to be migrane.  Eyes felt the size of tennis balls and couldn&#39;t open eyes.  Could not stand any noise or any light.  Could not pick head up off pillow.  Constant swallowing like going to throw up.  Day #2 same thing.  Day #3 same thing but eyes felt like golf balls.  Eyes blood shot.  Day #4 (today) still some head ache and swollen eyes.  No energy.  Am scheduled for March 8 to have second shot.     WILL NOT.  Getting on plane on March 10 and will not take chance of this happening again.  Husband read that second shot has worse effects.  I sincerely feel like a &#34;lab rat&#34; since no one knows what happens to people after vaccines.  Would be really great if someone will contact me to explain reaction to shot.

Could not lift arms above shoulders, make a fist, hard to stand after sitting.  He saw doctor beginning of following week and prescribed a round of prednisone.  I spoke with patient today and said that he is feeling better and strength is returning but, still weak.  Doctor told him to delay taking his 2nd dose of Moderna for 1 month.

She then said she was feeling overall unwell.  Over the subsequent 30 minutes, she described a severe headache, nausea, itching, and had trouble answering basic questions. Paramedics were called, who conducted an evaluation, which noted dizziness, vision trouble and uneven arm weakness. Paramedics determined she needed further evaluation at a hospital, and was taken to Hospital.

This was a horrifying and careless mistake.  My mother is experiencing a headache that has been intense for 48 hours now, a very large visible lump at the injection site along with a red rash.  She has had  dizziness and lightheadedness.  She also has ringing in her ears.  The main reason for filing this report is because of the error made and the concern of what other effects getting a double dose of the 1st shot will cause her.

Her caretakers called the squad and she was admitted to the hospital with possible transverse myelitis.

                                                First vaccine digestive symptoms and minor aches; very sore left arm lasted 7 days; 2nd vaccine: 102 degree fever on next day; aches and pains all over; could barely get out of bed; inability to eat at all for 24 hours; digestive symptoms: gas, acid refulx, nausea; giant burps. By next day, very painful electric transitory pains (seconds) in core of my vascular formation in my upper left leg. This is a congenital defect that responds to estrogen, but also some medicines like synthroid, which I do not take after getting reaction with just 3 pills. Successfully moderated Hashimoto&#39;s with strict gluten-free and dairy-free diet. I have never experience such severe leg pain and massive swelling, still happening today. Th The only other time that I have experienced these short intermitent &#34;electric&#34; pains was during infertility treatment at age 40, more than 30 years ago. I suspect something in the adjuvant. I hope that this will exit my body because the sudden swelling and severe pain is not something I can endure. It barely beats dying from Covid-19. My quality of life is wrecked for the time being. I suspect that this vaccine has caused an autoimmune attack on my vascular malformation; that my T cells have gone beserk. I&#39;d be willing to have my antibodies against Covid checked and I&#39;ll bet I have more than average! The havoc for people with autoimmunity and Moderna vaccine is serious. I despair and hope that it won&#39;t have a lasting impact on my health. I will volunteer to be studied, but no more Moderna vaccine for me! I trusted the medical establishment and government and this has not worked out well!

On 14 Feb 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Within one minute, the nurse gave her the second dose of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided). The patient had a hard time breathing, bad headache, large redness on left arm, lightheadedness, and tinnitus (ringing in ears). The patient took ibuprofen (400 mg) on 14 Feb 2021 and 15 Feb 2021. On 16 Feb 2021, the patient took Advil (200 mg).   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The outcome of the event, within a minute of each other the nurse gave 2 full doses of vaccine, was considered resolved on 14 Feb 2021. The outcomes of the events: hard time breathing, redness on left arm, lightheadedness, tinnitus-ringing in ears, and headache is unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On Monday night, Day 4, I woke at 11 p.m. with chills and shaking, temperature of 99.9 F. Went to the bathroom, urinated, took Tylenol and went back to bed. Woke again at 2:00 a.m, still chilled, and tried to stand up and my legs wouldn&#39;t hold me. I managed to lift myself to my feet and clutching furniture get to the bathroom, with complete loss of bladder control on the way. Took more Tyleonol, drank more water, put on clean pajamas but couldn&#39;t lift my knees to step into them, had to put them on the floor and pull them up. Went to sleep eventually. When I woke at about 5 a.m., all was completely normal. No fever, legs fine, usual bladder control.

                                                pt stated that starting about 1:30 after getting the vax she had nausea and severe pain in the right arm which kept increasing in pain until she was unable to move her arm.  That night her arm was in the 9-10 range for pain.  She hasn&#39;t been able to sleep due to the pain.  The next day she took Tylenol but did not help with pain. She had a strange taste in her mouth and also loss of appetite.  On 3/6/2021  she started getting a back ache.  She tried taking Ibuprofen which helped some with swelling in her arm but not the pain.  On 3/7/2021 she started getting a headache, brain fog and saying her words backwards.  She is very upset with the lack of warning that she was given at the time of the getting the first dose of the vax about being in this type of pain afterwards.  She said she was not prepared for this.  She has to have help doing everything and lives alone. Today the arm pain seems to slightly be improving but her back is still hurting.  Pt contacted her PCP.  They only instructed her to take Tylenol and not to ice it.  She contacted the Public Health Dept they told her to take Ibuprofen and to ice it.  She is getting conflicting information and doesn&#39;t know how to treat it.

                                                Began with sore arm and body discomfort from the neck down to the bottom of feet, including shoulder blades in back,  2:30 a.m., Saturday.   Increasing discomfort and needing to move every few minutes in bed.  Then on arising, was hot and light-headed, with aches continuing.  About 12:30 p.m. after a trip to the mailbox, I came in the house and collapsed in a chair.  Tried to get to the bedroom and had to go down to the floor due to weakness, light-headedness and heavy sweating.  Laid on the floor an hour and with husband&#39;s help, made it back to bed.  I experienced no more pain!  Spent most of the time in bed until about 11:00 a.m. on Sunday.  I gradually improved in strength over the next 24 hours.  I&#39;m doing much better today with limited activity.  I don&#39;t have much appetite yet.

I could not stand or walk.  I am reporting this because it is outside your normal prediction on the timinh of side effects.  You need to add this vaeiation to your public information. I panicked and called the Nurse Hot Line -they told me to call 911 and go to the ER.. So I called another Nurst HotLine and they ld me to call 911 and go to the ER.  Instead I simply slept for 35 hours and I am fine.  Please mention in your information that in some cases,  a reaction can occur up to 12 days later,  Btw there is nothing in my medical history to otherwise explain the incident.

I also experienced pain and stiffness in my knees that began about an hour after  the  vaccination. It lasted about  5-6 hours when it totally stopped.

Began to have swallowing difficulty. I was getting a woozie feeling within 30 minutes. I took 100mgm benedryl by mouth w about a pint of water. For the next 50-60  minutes, the tightness continued as far as below my collar bones  face very tight swollen. Red raised itchy rash started all over my body.  Had epipen in hand as well as stat dose of prednisone to take if necessary.  (I have an allergic reaction protocol in hand from my doc for these cases. Transport to ER is always there if needed) . Took about an hour for the benedryl to start countering the adverse affect.  Took another 100 mgm at the 4 hr post injection time mark.  By bedtime about 10pm, I felt very fatigued, throat &amp; back of tongue very sore &amp; raw feeling.

The next day felt awful but realized that I had had a deep muscle massage, the HARD Way.  I drank a lot of water, much more than usual to get rid of toxins. The following day I felt fine.

                                                About 8 hours after the 2nd shot I developed Severe dizziness. Went to bed. Laid down for about 1/2 hr, When got up to go to bathroom, my body shook ALL OVER all over: legs, hands, arms ---extreme shaking. Very hard to walk to bathroom. Even when sat down to urinate, body still shook all over. Hard to go back to bed--still shaking--held on to doors, furniture. Slept all night until 9am the next morning. Stayed in bed for another hr. Got up, but then back to bed for most of the day. Got up at 7pm---ate hot oatmeal.. Back to bed about 9pm. Today, 2 days after shot, was able to stay up most of the day. Slept from 2:30pm until 4pm. Then ate some pizza. Had no interest in eating even when I ate the pizza (did not feel nauseous, just no interest)

That feeling passed and was able to walk home and was getting vertigo.  She had a sore arm the next day, very fatigued and exhaustion.  Three days later had redness appear on the arm and then had headaches, and insomnia that night.  Her eyes were burning as well.  A day later had irregular heart beat and then six days later had the red line, raised in a circle that lasted one day.  She then continued to have the itching and then became a rash which was traveling under arm and onto her chest.  She then went to the city UC and was spreading to her breast, and started to subside.  Since then she has been having on and off headaches, on and off itching of both of her arms, as well as her scalp and other parts of her body.   As  a child had a history of hives.  When she went to the UC they did an EKG due to the irregular heart beat and did not want to go to the ER during the pandemic.  He gave her one Benadryl and 3 Ibuprofen which she only took one of, as she has a lot of allergies.  She has been taking Zyrtec 5 mg for the itching when she has it, which works for her.  The symptoms are subsiding, and has transient rashes on the vaccine arm, and on the right arm still have a few areas and still itching on and off.

                                                RN administered injection incorrectly into the bursa, not IM. This resulted in extreme pain and inability to move arm. Began having muscle spasms in lower back using different muscle to reposition and for ADLs. Finally was able to see doctor 3-12-21. Given scripts for Tramadol and muscle relaxant. Had follow up appointment with Sports Medicine MD to receive a steroid injection in Left shoulder. Diagnosed with SIRVA (Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration) I now require Physical Therapy. I am unable to use my arm per MD and PT. I have difficulty dressing, cooking, routine housekeeping, etc. While I feel better since the injection, I am terrified the pain will return. I live alone and was unable to sleep, drive, dress, cook or do any ADLS including wash my hair or dress. The pain was completely debilitating. Even after the steroid injection, I have physical therapy and MD appointments, daily exercises and instructions to not use my arm.

I have done yoga for decades and never have had any problem sitting cross legged - but now my knees are too sore and my legs hurt.. my palms have turned red.. and I almost swooned into unconsciousness a few days ago- you can say I am just old- but I never had sore legs. swollen knees, red palms, and dizziness before in my life.  I think I might hesitate to get the second shot if I* had it to do over again

                                                A couple of hours after receiving the shot, I became dizzy, sick to my stomach and nauseous. For the next few hours, I suffered from diarrhea, bad stomach pains, vomiting and was very chilled. I felt like I was going to pass out numerous times. Once the above subsided, I slept on and off. The symptoms never were that bad again. By morning I was feeling better, just weak and chilled. That feeling has stayed for the past two days.

                                                During first 12 hrs after injection, I noticed only redness, mild discomfort and itching at injection site.  By 12 hrs later, I began to experience fever, chills, nausea, headache, muscle and joint discomfort, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue.  This lasted all night.   The day following injection I still had a fever (102) and chills and redness on arm had increased in size; also headache (predominately in both eyes).   I slept a lot during that day.  Day 3 low grade fever persisted. Used Tylenol with good results.  By day 4 feeling much better!!  Redness at injection site increased but less itching and discomfort. Regaining energy.

(A trip from my bed to the bathroom was difficult.)  This proceeded to severe nausea (I retched into the. toilet bowl a couple of times and came close to vomiting).  I dosed in bed and the severity of the symptoms eased, but I really haven&#39;t felt completely over it until today (2-22-2021).

The next day, I had an elevated heart rate and dizziness.  I had several more episodes of a rapid heart rate that day.  I called my cardiologist&#39;s office and they advised me to start on propranolol 20mg twice daily.  They had prescribed that earlier as I have had episodes of that in the past but did not take the medication.  After the 3 doses, approximately 12 hours apart, the lightheadedness and dizziness got worse.  I called the cardiologist on call and they d/cd the med.  Today, the lightheadedness &amp; dizziness is worse.

Continued throbbing at site. Placed arm in a sling because I was unable to  lift my arm and it gave me some relief. At supper I took t tramadol.  Still in throbbing pain when I went to bed. Slept well. Pain somewhat subsided but arm still unable to lift  in morning. Treated with chiropractic adjustment. More relief. Still  some soreness, but now able to life arm.

If I tried to in my sleep the pain would awaken me. The next day after my shot at about 10 AM I began to feel wonky (dizzy) and tired.  For the entire rest of the day I had to literally lay around which is unusual for me as I&#39;m very active. I was too tired to do anything--extreme fatigue. The night was the worst.  I had a fever and sweats and  horrible  dry mouth.  I woke up about 3 times an hour throughout the night because of the dry mouth and had to drink water.  I drank three 16 fl oz bottles of water.  I had to urinated 5 times in the night. [normal for me is I never wake to urinate.   I go to bed about 11 pm and wake up at 7.  Today I feel normal except my arm is still tender from the shot.

About 15 hours after the vaccine I start vomiting bile.  I was so dizzy my husband had to help me walk to the bathroom.  I got scared and we talked about calling 911, but decided nothing was life threatening.  On the third day of this I broke out in a red rash from my neck to my thigh that lated for several days getting lighter each day.  Even with these 3 days of hell, I would take the vaccine again because I think it is vital to getting rid of the pandemic.

                                                The next morning after my vaccination I was extremely dizzy and nauseous when I tried to get out of bed.  This lasted about four  hours. Then I could begin to slowly get up out of bed and walk around.   Twelve hours later I was almost back to normal, if I didn&#39;t move my head too fast. At 8:00 am  I called my doctor&#39;s office and talked with a nurse who was very helpful.   I slept 3 hours in the afternoon.   The next morning all the reaction was gone and I went about my normal activities.

                                                Within 2 hours arm was very very sore.  Progressed through the night to the point of extreme pain to move arm.  Couldn&#39;t reach into cupboards, no range of motion without extreme pain, no strength in arm to lift anything, run sweeper etc. I have tried hot and cold compresses, lidacaine patch, thera-worx, lots of tylenol, some advil.  I have a TENS unit and started using that 5 days ago.  Has helped some.  Been 5 weeks with this pain. I am a side sleeper so that was definately out when I did get to rest.

                                                The shot hurt when administered, didn&#39;t feel the first one. About 2 minutes after shot, felt light headed and like the shot contained adrenalin or epinephrine. That subsided by the time I left the site, although I remained slightly light headed all evening. Went to bed at 10:00 with an extremely sore arm, beginning of body aches and fever of 99.3. Awoke at 1:00am with 101.9 temp, extreme muscle and joint pain, and every time I moved anything, even a finger I would feel the sensation of a chill or slight electric shock. Urinated every hour from 1:00am and 5:00 am. When I awoke at 5:00 I was so weak, nauseated and dripping sweat I barely got my dog fed and let out for the morning. The nausea passed quickly but I thought I was going to have to lie down on the floor during that wave.Went back to bed, slept until 7:00 and was pretty much a zombie until 6:00pm last night(March 10) when all exhaustion and muscle pain disappeared and I have been fine since then.

By evening an continuing into the night of March 3, these red rash areas with large welts spread all over body. A steroid ointment and antihistamine were used to calm. After approximately 5 days the rash was gone. This rash appeared to look like the internet article pictures from BFF and Self, only the pictures were of the arm of injection.

I had extreme difficulty moving, and I live alone. It lasted another 5 hours before slight improvement began.

                                                Per pt, after she received her first dose on 2/17/21, she had soreness to her left shoulder the next day. She says it lasted about 2 days, but started having decreased range of motion to her shoulder. She said the soreness has resolved, but she still has some decreased ROM compared to her right shoulder. PCP notified by MA and she said it was okay for patient to receive the 2nd dose of moderna, but she may have the same reaction. Pt still wanted the 2nd dose and said she will monitor her right shoulder for any pain/discomfort. Per pt, she will apply heat or ice pack and maintain ROM to both her shoulders as needed.

But they still called a nurse, who wheeled me in to the vaccination site to take vital signs.

The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included atorvastatin, bupropion hydrochloride, cetirizine hydrochloride, anxiety medicines, clonazepam, metformin,  metoprolol, and trazodone.  On 01 Mar 2021, the patient received the first dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) and 45 minutes later was extremely dizzy. At home one hour later she started to vomit for one hour constantly, became completely unconscious, didn&#39;t remember anything, and was really scared. The last thing she remembered was telling her husband: you need to call somebody because she felt like she was going to die. The patient was taken by ambulance to the hospital and while in the ambulance, the patient was administered medicines for nausea and blood pressure. The blood pressure measurement taken in the ambulance was 215 over 156.  The patient didn&#39;t know her address or anything else.  She was released to go home after a few hours, but still felt so sick.  On Sunday night (07-Mar-2021), the patient threw up again.  On an unspecified date, she had a headache like someone was putting pressure on her brain; she also had a fast heartbeat.  Since the vaccine, the patient reported feeling really nauseous and remembering nothing about it.  She is still weak. Treatment information included ondansetron medicine for nausea.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event, weak, was considered not recovered/not resolved. The outcome of the events, completely unconscious/ passed out, dizziness, vomiting for 1 hour constantly/threw up, don&#39;t remember nothing, felt like she was going to died, high blood pressure 215 over 156 , felt so sick, headache like someone is pressure her brain, fast heartbeat, and nauseate were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I&#39;m in constant pain which is not relieved with Tylenol, ice or heat compresses, epsom baths, light exercise, or stretching.  At night I have trouble sleeping because my knee is so painful.  Several times I&#39;ve almost fallen.  My lower back is also bothering me because I can&#39;t walk normally and am putting even pressure on my knees, legs, and back.  Prior to the second shot, I was having this kind of ongoing pain.  It has severely limited my ability to get around and I often use a cane so I won&#39;t fall.

                                                The day before the first vaccine she was up and acting normal, laundry, housework and knew what to do.   She has severe dementia but was doing OK and knew where she was.  She got the first vaccine on 1/29/21, and the 3rd and 4th day they noticed she was having hallucinations and saying things that weren&#39;t there.  She could hear baby&#39;s crying but there were no baby&#39;s present.   Within 7 days she had what the son described as a stroke. He said that she was watching television and he was on a conference call and he noticed she walked into a wall and he asked if she was okay and starting stumbling across the room and when he touched her she felt very heavy and said that one side of her face was drooping.  He got her back into the chair and called 9-1-1.  She was so agitated at the hospital that the husband does not know what they gave her and they kept her for a week.    They finally got her under control.  They discharged her from there and she that was all that they could do with her.  They brought her home with nurses assistance and her paranoia was evident, hallucinations were very evident. They said that they tried to do a CAT Scan and an MRI and they said that she did not have a stroke.   Restless was very adamant, talking strange things and wanting to go to her son&#39;s house when she was there.  Before that vaccination she knew where she was and after that she did not know where she was thinking she was at one location and just confusion.     She then got her 2nd vaccine and then her husband went out of town and took her back home on 2/24/21 as he was able to get her in a car and travel and able to eat and knew somewhat what was going on.  On 2/25/21 when he brought her home to  a long term care facility.  She was chanting constantly, had irritability, anger, cognition completely eroded.  She was very agitated, very combative.  Drugs would not calm her down, and tried to get CAT scans or MRI&#39;s but were unsuccessful due to her combativeness.  She was screaming and yelling 24 hours a day to the top of her lungs and gave her Ativan which had the adverse effects of what they were supposed to do.  Had biting, hallucinations, paranoia.   She had a couple of falls, they had her in a wheelchair and tried to feed her and she would fall down.  They took her to the hospital a few times and she progressively got worse.  On 4/19/21 she shut down and quit eating, quit drinking, closed her eyes, and lasted a week like that and then she died on 4/24/21 @ 2:30 AM.   None of her doctors could figure out what had happened.  They were finally able to get a CAT scan and felt that she may have a stroke.      Finally they memory care facility told them to come a take her to the hospital and they had moved their hospice patient&#39;s as she was screaming and disruptive and they could not handle her anymore.     They thought she was suffering from Lewy body dementia at one point.  They were going to have her tested for that and they could not do it on Saturday when she passed for genetics and missed those timelines and could not do it.

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

                                                In the arm that she got the vaccine it was real sore and then got fine.  The problem is in the right shoulder, which she did not have a vaccine in.  It was Friday morning at 8:00 AM.  Previously had rotator cuff surgery 16 years ago in that arm, something has happened to the right shoulder.  Not able to raise the arm at all.  Cannot raise it up towards her face.  Left arm is crippled due to a fall 5 years ago and broke it in 3 places, but not able to move that.  Not having any  other problems, not sure if this was associated with the vaccine or not since it was the opposite arm.

My heart calmed down in a day,  I also had a 24 hour temp of 101.4, which  then hovered between 100and 99 degrees for the next five days along with continued weakness and achiness, and a lot of fatigue. It is now 27 January and I am just beginning to feel a little better.

Started feeling sick during the night, knew something was wrong.  Could barely get out of bed, was hot, possibly low grade fever, had chills, was achy, bad headache like you feel when having the flu, weakness.   Took Tylenol and her regular medicines.  Today, 1/29/21 when she woke up still has extreme soreness, hot to touch.  She looked at her left arm and it&#39;s all swollen, red and itchy.  She&#39;s now afraid to go back for the 2nd vaccine.   Caller her pharmacy due to her arm and she was instructed to take Benadryl and Ibuprofen, which she only takes Tylenol.

This included a strange sensation of my head floating and an odd sense of loosing consciousness.  The vertigo was awful, and I could barely stand.  This lasted each evening for about 6 night.  It subsided in the morning, after I felt more stabilized in walking.

                                                Passed out-was totally out for a couple of second; UTI; PVCs; very very dizzy; Vasovagal reaction; Arm was sore-not hurting much; A spontaneous report was received from a 74-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced dizziness, passed out, vasovagal reaction, urinary tract infection, premature ventricular contractions and arm pain.   The patient&#39;s medical history included back problems with osteoarthritis in the spinal column neck and lower back. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included celecoxib and nortriptyline.   On 20 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 21 Jan 2021, the patient reported she got very dizzy and passed out. Her husband relays that she was totally out for a couple of seconds. She went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a vasovagal reaction and urinary tract infection. Premature ventricular contractions were also discovered and was not known prior to this event. Patient reports a normal blood pressure of 114-120/75. Patient also stated her arm was sore the day after vaccine but not hurting much during her usual four mile walk.   Treatment for the event included intravenous medications in the emergency room, cephalexin, and a heart monitor.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events passed out, dizziness, vasovagal reaction and arm pain were resolved. The outcome of the events, urinary tract infection and premature ventricular contractions were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of dizziness, passed out, vasovagal reaction, urinary tract infection, premature ventricular contractions and arm pain.  The events occurred the next day after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current limited available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.  Further information have been requested.

It is now 4 full days since vaccination and still like this.  I looked online and it&#39;s called  &#34;covid arm.&#34;  So it&#39;s not unexpected, although I am wondering when it will go away.  Also the day after I received the vaccine, I had a LOT of muscle soreness, aches, etc., to the point it was hard to get up and down, so I just wrapped up in a blanket and sat around.  That issue was all gone the next day.  I don&#39;t want to waste your time, but thought I should share info about my &#34;covid arm.&#34;  Thank you.

Patient reportedly went to emergency department . Patient&#39;s spouse says that she continues to experience right sided weakness as of today&#39;s date, and she saw her primary care provider yesterday 2/8/21 who suspects vaccine-related muscle weakness. I advised patient&#39;s spouse to contact her neurologist as she has a history of left-brain stroke and brain tumor and I am concerned that the patient may have experienced another cardiovascular event.

Shoulder injured in a jogging injury/ fall twenty years ago (subachromial impingement), but have had no problem with since, became &#34;frozen&#34; and extraordinarily painful (on pain scale its a 9). It is post-vaccine day 10 now and it appears to be showing no signs of abating. Only  relief is 400mg ibuprofen on a prn basis. Cannot lift left arm or extend left arm (abduction). Believe the  vaccine may have caused a vigorous immune response (great!), however it may be an &#34;cytokine storm&#34; which has caused an acute arthritis event. Concerned about immunization #2.

She felt weak and tired  after this episode and so went back to bed for several hours.  Later that day she had another episode of feeling lightheaded as if she might pass out, while sitting at a hair salon waiting for her appointment, but did not actually pass out, just felt a wave of heat and slight nausea, but did not faint.  She had one further near syncopal episode at home later that night when she also noticed she was a little &#34;jittery&#34; and noted a strange smell that the rest of her family did not notice.    She also reports that she has had near syncopal episodes in the past and thinks she may have been a little dehydrated the day these incidents occurred.

                                                She got home and after 3 hours she started seeing things, and talking nonsense. Every bone in her body was hurting. It was early in the morning and she thought it was in the middle of the night.  Her husband had to help her to walk with the walker, and was out of her head. She has not been able to walk since Monday afternoon about 4:00. She is now just today able to get to the bathroom. She has taken Extra Strength Tylenol, Trazedone and Klonopin so she could sleep as she has not been able to. She has never experienced anything like this in her life due to the pain. She is a little better today, she gets dizzy when she gets up but still in the bed. She called the doctor yesterday and spoke to the nurse who told her to go to the ER but did not as her husband cannot help her much as he has prostate cancer.

Quickly progressed to  hard, hot, red, swollen  and painful  area over top of arm,  continued itching, and stiffness.  It has been difficult to raise my left arm above shoulder level.  Somewhat better today (February 26th), but injection site still hot and hard, and stiffness in muscle still present.  Itching has subsided.

                                                Following the vaccine, within 3 minutes her bottom lip got numb, then her tongue swelled and then her eyes got fluttery uncontrollably, dizziness and weak.  They had her lie down in a recliner.  Her BP was 190/110.  She did not need an EPI pen and within 15 minutes her lip became unnumb, and her tongue swelling receded, was still a little thick, and her face was swollen, was red and flushed.  So they waited 30 minutes, her BP was not coming down, sent to the ER and observed for 3 hours and slowly her BP came down, all her other symptoms subsided and she was able to drive herself home.  Last night 2/25/21 she had great itching on her chest, which has since stopped.  Her tongue is still a little swollen, about 20% still feels thick.  When she left the hospital her BP was 146/86.  She has not taken anything for the symptoms just her regular routine medications.   She did feel tired and spacy feeling, and has been off of work since Wednesday as she could not focus to go to work.

About 10 minutes later, stood up and walked about 4 meters to the refrigerator, grabbed onto handles and my husband rushed over and grabbed me as ir seemed I was going to fall. Sat me down in sofa, where after short? while  I recovered. After getting up to go to refrigerator, no recollection of anything that followed. My internist?s diagnosis - síncope.

It is now 72 hours after injection and I can barely get out of bed....I cannot pursue normal activities.     I am nauseous all the time, a terrible upset stomach with multiple bowel movements.    After 48 hours I have developed a bronchial cough when reclining..     I am dizzy, lightheaded, achy, overall feeling a malisse.      However, I can move my arm although it remains red and swollen.....but redness is not as severe.

Dose 2 - A week of being achy, slight fever, tiredness, dizziness and I had a little bit of nausea - I was really bad the second day (the symptoms). The nausea and fever was gone in a couple of days. The achiness lasted about a week.  Tylenol - 600 mg (double strength) - I probably took two of those all together.

Was told to wait another 15 min and was given water and snack to elevate blood sugar in case it had dropped (I do not have diabetes or history of sugar drops).  When I stood to leave, I stumbled in the hall and was told to stay and blood pressure was taken, which was elevated to about 170, which I had taken as I do daily, before I arrived and it was 119/60.  This was done at hospital by nurse. It was taken again, and it had gone down to 145, and I felt well enough to leave and drive home.  Stayed home, and vertigo was obvious, have had years ago, not recently, so I knew it was side effect.

Then at night I couldn&#39;t put my legs down they hurt and my shins felt like I had shin splines.  This lasted about a week or more. I went to a Dr. because my left knee and shin were hurting so bad.  The Dr. was not sure and did a Doppler to see If I had a Blood clot in my left knee but I didn&#39;t. She put me on an antibiotic, that I really didn&#39;t need I don&#39;t think. I took that for  a few days and stopped because it wasn&#39;t helping any. On the 14th I went to see another Dr. and he put me on Prednisone, at this time I could barley walk my right hip was hurting so much. I was taking little bitty steps.  The prednisone has been helping, it&#39;s allowed me to walk and to function. I was to the point it was getting so bad. I&#39;m still having some stiffness, my left elbow gets inflamed at times, my left hand and knuckle swell and get stiff at times too. It seems to move around at effect different places.  The medication helps me move better, I have been off work for 7 weeks, I plan to go back and try half days.

Thirty-six hours later (Tuesday, 2/16/21) I had a rash on my left hand. My hand was very itchy, red and swollen.  I had a bump under the skin of my left  hand about the size of a dime.  I also felt some tingling from my waist down to my feet which went away after a few hours. The rash and the bump lasted 3 days.  Dr (primary) told me &#34;Do not get the second shot.&#34;

I had chills, my teeth were chattering, and I was very weak and scared to get out of bed for fear of falling down.  I had never felt so bad, even with flu.  I took Tylenol, and that did no good, so I took Ibuprophen along with it 3 separated times, and that made me feel better.  The day after the shot I took my temperature and it was 99.6 an hour after the Tylenol 6 hour dose period.  I usually have low temperatures like 95-97, so this was really high for me.  That night after supper I was able to stay up and watch TV, so I was starting to feel better.  I was very tired the next day.  I called no doctor..  I should add that I am a small person, 4 ft. 11 inches, and 116 pounds.

My usual temperature is 97.7.  I had severe neck ache and head ache extreme fatigue,  and was bed ridden for 4 days.  My fever started to decrease on the third day.   I had roving pains which lasted 3-4 hours in each place:  first the right back above the waist where the kidneys are, then just below my right breast, then the left side of the top of my head.  Throughout I had to have a wet cloth on my head.  About a week later I had a relapse.... my temperature rose to 98 and I had the same headache place and neck ache at the bottom back of my head along with extreme fatigue and brain fog.  It lasted at least two days.   Of course as expected my arm was sore, but very swollen like a goose egg,  red, and impossible to move.    I still feel the same fatigue, and have to go to be very early but have insomnia and extreme anxiety.

At around 2:30, 3:00 AM I woke up with running diarrhea which lasted until around 4:00 AM. I had a suppository and used that to stop the diarrhea but the diarrhea kept coming, I finally drank Pedialyte  which I keep because I have had issues in the past . Just a side note my right arm was really hurting and I could not lift it for one day

The roof of mouth had a strong burning sensation then the top lip and area above top lip went numb and tingling.   Arm pain which improved with massaging and swinging arm.  Within 3 hours of the vacination, most of numbness and tingling gone from upper lip and above upper lip.  From time of vacination, I drank at least one glass of water an hour and swung and massaged arm as needed.   Within five hours, almost all  adverse symptoms were gone..I was left with a slight headache across forehead and back of head. Slept well that night; no fevers.  Morning after shot, slight headache but fine. But by 8:30 a.m. I was very, very tired.  Arms and legs felt almost too heavy to move or lift, and I felt a little &#39;out of it&#39;.  Slept 1 1/2 hours.  No energy, sat around entire day, drinking about 6 glasses of water.  No energy and tired rest of day.   Next morning all symptoms except slight headache were gone so I worked in the yard for about an hour.   My temperature was normal during the entire experience.

Left VM for the nurse that i know at the health dept. on 3/8/21 sent email to the nurse at health dept. on 3/12/21 no response as yet...just felt this should be reported, i think the injection was too high and injected into my acromial process &amp; could possibly cause permanent damage in the future, wanted to report as felt perhaps the administrator of the 2nd shot should have technique reviewed to prevent this from happening to someone else...my major concern.

                                                After breakfast on March 14, she started to have a low grade fever.  She took a two Tylenol (extra strength gel capsules) and decided to lie down in bed. Around noon, she tried to get out of bed to go to the bathroom but was unable to stand and fell out of bed and onto the ground.  While trying to get up she started to feel dizzy and was too weak to get herself up.  Also while still on the ground she started to feel nauseous and eventually vomited.  After vomiting , she was able to get up and the dizziness and nausea went away.  For 2-3 days (Sun-Tues) after the incident, she experienced muscle aches and pain around her waist/stomach area.  Also during this time she continued to take the 2 Tylenol every 6 hours and is currently still taking it.

Fever of 100.9.Couldn&#39;t move my legs or sit up and eventually fell to the floor on my back.  Spent over an hour using my elbows to scoot across floor. Hit head 3 times and passed out for awhile. Got help and went to the ER.  CT showed no concussion. Pain reliever helped and after several hours was discharged with instructions to use a walker. Used walker for 2 days and then cane. Still have leg pain on occasion and now the Vertigo is worse. Also had reaction to first vaccine but just high fever, 101.4 and aches.

Saturday had a killer headache, severe muscle aches, extreme fatigue, dizzy and brain fog. The next day I had all of the same but less. Ate dinner night of the vaccine but did not eat or drink anything besides water again until 2 days later at 2pm as I had no appetite. When I ate my stomach hurt a little. I was tired for about 4 days and little appetite.

                                                Faint; Dizzy; Slight reaction; Very tired; A spontaneous report, was received from a consumer (patient), a 74 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced faint (syncope), dizzy (dizziness), slight reaction (vaccination complication) and very tired (fatigue).  The patient&#39;s current conditions included atrial fibrillation, back trouble and peripheral neuropathy (diagnosed years ago). The patient had medication allergies to pain medications and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Concomitant products included digoxin, carisoprodol, metamizole sodium and warfarin sodium.  On 09-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09FEB--2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had a slight reaction and became very tired, faint and dizzy. The patient&#39;s husband helped her to bed. The next morning on 10-FEB-2021, the events were resolved. The patient was scheduled for next Moderna vaccine (second dose) on 09-MAR-2021. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, faint, dizzy, slight reaction and very tired was recovered/resolved on 10-FEB-2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

After 2 1/2 days, the fever and chills, headache, and nausea had subsided. The tinnitus is the same as it&#39;s been since 3/17 (meaning worse than it&#39;s been over the past several decades), dizziness is mostly okay, some hearing loss is still noticeable when I am speaking with people who are wearing masks.

                                                It&#39;s been two weeks since shot and I am still experiencing bleeding gums when I brush my teeth (water pick and electronic tooth brush). Last week my feet, toes, hands, fingers were inflamed and red. Felt stinging and hot. Difficult to walk. This week, although I don&#39;t notice bruising, to date everything I touch or bump hurts my hands and feet (even while typing this info on computer keyboard). Slightest bump hurts and feels very nervy. My muscles ache, but I&#39;m not having any problem breathing and no fever. Not as tired this week, but still more tired than usual. Experiencing occasional bouts of excessive coughing, but could be due to the spring bloom recently.

                                                Patient said 10 minutes after the vaccine she experienced dizziness and feeling faint but quickly recovered. Approximately 2 hours later, patient reported that the left side of her face and hands became numb and &#34;felt like when Novacaine is wearing off&#34;. She went to ER and was worked up for a stroke. No abnormalities found. She continues to experience a &#34;stabbing pain&#34; in her head intermittently that resolves as soon as it happens. She reports past history of vertigo several years ago, however facial numbness and head pain is new for her.  She followed up with her primary doctor 4 days ago and they feel it was vaccine related.

                                                The morning after receiving the vaccine, I woke up very dizzy.  During the entire weekend, I was very dizzy.  Bending over or reaching down, turning my head quickly, and often walking, I experienced dizziness.  In lying down in the evenings (next five evenings) I was especially dizzy- it felt as if the room were spinning.

                                                After the shot, I went home and felt fine.  I did some housework (cleaning) for about thirty minutes, then sat to rest .  Shortly thereafter, I began feeling pain in my left arm.  The pain became more severe as the day progressed until it was very severe and movement of my arm was limited.  The pain progressed throughout the night and also moved into my shoulder.  I got very little sleep even after taking Tylenol and trying heat and  ice applications.  Now, on the third day I am still having pain and am unable to lift my arm or move it outward without severe pain.  I am definitely hindered in my movement and use of left arm.  This is disturbing as I am an artist and need both arms to do my work.

I got auras before migraines years ago but they are rare now.  2.  Three hrs after the shot, I suddenly developed severe imbalance/dizziness which made me nauseous and I broke out in a cold sweat but no fever occurred.  I laid down to relieve the nausea and keep from falling.  In approx an hour, I was back to normal.  This has happened twice previously approximately 2 years ago (cause unknown) so I am not sure this event was due to the shot.  I did not seek medical attention and nothing has occurred since then.

Both the nausea and severe migraine lasted for 54 hours after onset.  The first evening I also experienced teeth-chattering chills.  Finally saw an improvement around 2:00 a.m. on Monday morning, February 1, when I woke up in a total sweat.  By daylight on February 1, the nausea and migraine were  gone, but I experienced mild dizziness and blurry vision.  By Tuesday morning, February 2, I am more or less back to normal, although my vision is still a bit blurry and the dizziness still present if I move my head too quickly.

Woke me around 3:00 AM, lasted 2 days. 3rd day felt washed out and hollow, head still feels swollen.  Unable to move out of bed for 2 days due to pain. Drank lots and lots of water to flush out of system. Am in between doctors right now  and was to out of things to call anybody.  Don&#39;t really want the 2nd vaccination due to the more severe effects 2nd doses are having on others. COVID symptoms twice in my life is more then enough.

Lasted several days.  First second and third week gradually started having spasm of my entire neck radiating to collarbone and top of shoulder and left top arm and to my top of head. The third week my neck spasm got so severe I could hardly move my head because I would get severe pain.  Still having severe stiff  neck  with pain radiating to head collar bone and top of shoulder.  Not sure if these symptoms are related to the vaccine or my neck artritis.  My neck Artigas never given me these types of symptoms.

                                                Woke up about 1:00 am in delirium and feverish. No control over thought process or able to get up. Managed to get out of bed at 9:00 am but was so weak could barely make it up a flight of stairs. And when I did ended up in bathroom vomiting. Laid on floor to get some strength back. Went back to bed and slept restlessly until 4:00 pm.  Still feverish and weak but not as bad as earlier. Ate some cold grapes and went back to bed until the following morning. Tried to stay hydrated and took ibuprofen several times. My upper arm was red and blotchy for 3 days. Overall I?d say the severest part of the event lasted 48 hrs and another 24 hrs of tiredness and nausea but not vomiting.

                                                Adverse reaction began around midnight with chills, continued throughout the night alternating chills and hot flashes, severe backache, muscle aches in thighs and general malaise.  Got up around 8 to try to take a warm shower to ease muscle aches but as soon as I got into the bathroom I felt very hot, very nauseated and lightheaded.  I suspected hypotension but of course I wasn&#39;t able to prove it at the time. I attempted to get back to my bed but had syncopal episode a few feet from the bed where I collapsed onto the floor.  I just stayed on the floor and rested because it actually felt better lying down. I am a retired RN and suspect this adverse event was related to orthostatic hypotension.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

                                                I am a 75 year old female with severe Cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20% and an implanted defibrillator. I had my first COVID vaccine on Sunday, February 28.  I had had sinus problems with a little runny nose the week before...no fever, no chills, normal temperature.  Other than my arm being a little sore, i took two Tylenol the night of the vaccine and had no problems until Tuesday afternoon, March 2, 2021. i felt perfectly Sunday after =noon, all day Monday and Tuesday.  However while shopping at a nearby store as I got to the checkout counter I started having shortness of breath, It was hard for me to walk and I was very shaky.  I have an apple watch so I was able to check my heart rate.  The heart rate was anywhere from 58BPM to 177BPM and all over place in between,  i got in my car, trying to calm myself then called the EMTs.  They took me to hospital to the Emergency Room.  Several tests(see below) were performed.  The final diagnosis was hear palpitations.  They did a COVID test and I did test positive for the Rhino virus.  The doctors didn&#39;t know if my incident was related to receive the COVID vaccine and my defibrillator was checked, and a test was run that indicated it wasn&#39;t bad enough to activate the defibrillator.

In the ER, patient was hypertensive and labs showed elevated creatinine of 1.6 (baseline 1.27), BNP &gt;8000.  She describes her symptoms as a sub-acute onset hand and leg weakness.

She also admits to negative symptoms in the form of decreased sensation of her feet. She has been unable to stand on her feet since about two days ago. She appears to have some disturbance in time perception as her recollection of the progression of her disease is off by several weeks. she denies bowel/bladder incontinence or saddle anesthesia.

The next morning at 5 am, woke with right arm throbbing and a huge swelling where the vaccine was injected.  I got up, felt dizzy, and went the the bathroom, took my temperature, which was 101 F, then got the chills and had chest pains across my entire chest. Tried to go back to bed but the symptoms got worse.  Called my neighbor and asked him to take me to the ER.  He took me to the ER and I was checked for fever, had a chest x-ray, urine test, blood pressure checked and at 5 PM was admitted.

During the night, it felt like my hip was &#34;on fire&#34;.  1000 mg of Tylenol Rapid Release helped.  The pain was greatly diminished and my leg was able to bear weight by by 8 AM on the following day.

Because I very rarely drink alcohol, a little bit makes me sleepy.  After about 4 sips, I broke into a cold sweat, could barely manage to stand up and call out to my husband.  I then lost consciousness  (and wet myself).  (My husband caught me).  I have never fainted or passed out in my entire life!  I regained consciousness about 2 minutes later and then had the shakes for quite a while.  For the next day and a half I felt as if a truck had run over me.

                                                Night following shot, I slept badly and felt cold all night.  When I wanted to get up to go to the bathroom around 5:30 AM, I could not get myself off and out of the bed.  It was like my legs wouldn&#39;t work. When I was finally up, I had no control of my bladder and urinated all the way into my bathroom. When I was done on the toilet, I started to stand up and lost my balance. I tried to reach for the door jam but missed and fell backwards onto the toilet and sat hard and hit my back very hard against the top of the toilet.  I helped back to bed by boyfriend but had to get up several more times that morning and had the same weakness in my legs and no control over my bladder. My boyfriend had to leave to go home, so I called my sister to come and stay with me in case I couldn&#39;t get up again. One she was here, I ate a small amount of roast chicken and slept most of the afternoon. I slept thru the night and felt stronger the next day. I felt very tired and sleepy for the next couple of days, but (3 days later) am now feeling and moving in a more normal manner.
