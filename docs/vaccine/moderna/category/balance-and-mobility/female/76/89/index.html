Staff arrived and moved patient to floor,  head supported by patient&#39;s jacket.  We placed her feet above head (in a chair).  Upon questioning patient about her history with vaccines, patient stated she had had a similar reaction with blood draws, but not with a vaccine.  Patient also stated she is borderline diabetic and had only eaten a small bowl of cereal this morning and not had lunch yet.  Patient stated she was feeling better, we sat her up and she drank a bottle of orange juice.  Patient monitored for another 15 minutes, felt well and was escorted to her to her apartment and she claimed she felt well.  Patient instructed to call her PCP, 911, or go to the nearest emergency emergency room for any additional issues.

Her vital signs were taken over a course of 30 minutes and her blood pressure kept getting higher and higher to 210/140/ Pulse 55 and O2 sat was 99%. Dr. was called and she recommended pt be taken to the ER by the ambulance. The ambulance was called but the pt ended up leaving in the car with her son. I called both Medical Center and Hospital but pt had not been admitted to the ER this afternoon.

                                                Five minutes after the vaccine was injected, I became dizzy, my eyes teared and face swelled up and throat tightened.  The EMT&#39;s came, checked my lungs, etc.  and talked me through the episode which lasted about 15 minutes.  Then the swelling subsided.  I suspect it had, because I had dermal fillers approximately a year ago.  I had no other adverse affects, except for tiredness that evening.  People should be warned about this because it is a frightening event.  I have never had an adverse reaction to a vaccine before.

                                                The morning after receiving the vaccine, I could barely use my arms and had no use of my legs.  My husband called an ambulance and I was taken to emergency room.  I did not regain use of my legs until approximately 3:00 A.M., MONDAY 18.  Around 4:00 P.M., I was released to go home with PT through an in-home health provider.  While in the hospital MRI, x-rays, numerous blood work, etc. we?re performed.  No reason could be found.  It was speculated that I still had antibodies from having COVID in December and the vaccine was too much.

                                                My arm wasn&#39;t sore right away but I think I laid on it and the next morning it was sore. It felt like a bee sting I took some medicine and it went away.  On the 27th I had bad gas. I did try a new cereal and thought it was cereal. On the 28th I still gas and upset stomach like flu like symptoms  and felt light headed but not bad. On the 29th still an upset stomach and had diarrhea, I was still light headed and really shaky. I was really weak. I was shaking a lot at arms (hands) and legs were both shaking  and made it hard to walk. On the 30th I still really light headed and my legs and hands were still shaky, still having difficulty walking, still had an upset stomach and still felt weak. On the 31st my stomach was a lot better, I was still shaky and light headed, and I had a weak feeling. My head felt like when you feel like you have a head cold (pressure in my head). Today my stomach is better, I am still lightheaded and still shaky but not as bad. I still feel pressure in my head, but no runny nose or any other cold symptoms.   These were symptoms I had in March when I was sick for 3 weeks. I was negative for COVID but didn&#39;t get back to my normal self until the June.   Doctor was a private practice and recently closed so I do not see my new doctor till the 24th.

These symptoms lasted 7 days.   When I went to bed on Tuesday night, I woke up early in the morning with palpitations, very nauseated, and light headed.  The palpitations lasted about 2 hours, light headedness about 30 minutes.  I had no further palpitations or light headedness after this.

I believe the shot was injected too high on my shoulder.  Pain was severe for 3 days and I took maximum Tylenol.  The arm is usuable now, pain is less, still have trouble raising the arm up or back.  I have had no other ill effects from the vaccine.

Right arm got very sore, to the point of not being able to move it for a day; fever of 101.2, chills, sweats, stayed in bed most of Tuesday (the day after the shot was given), and then symptoms subsided Wednesday, but was weak and fatigued enough to stay in bed all day. Thursday, tried a little physical activity, and after 30 minutes playing croquet, had to stop and sit down. Went hon=me and napped again. Friday, napped most of day, as on Saturday, and yesterday, Sunday. Today is one week after the shot and I&#39;m still feeling weak - not my normal self.

I arose to use the bathroom and when standing at the sink experienced the room beginning to spin and darken.  I steadied myself at the sink; the dizziness passed; I returned to bed after taking two Tylenol tablets to relieve the pain.  My husband, who also received the Covid Moderna vaccine yesterday 2/17/2021 at 10:55 a.m. , was also awakened at 2:00 a.m. 2/18/20121 with the same muscle pains.   6:30 a.m. 2/18/2021 we were both feeling much better and able to carry on usual life activities (such as they are...)  [note 1: I walked 3 miles yesterday afternoon after receiving the vaccine and feeling perfectly fine.] [note 2: we both are enormously grateful for the vaccine!]

I was awake and knew what was happening.  I don?t know how long it lasted. When the episode was over, I went to sleep.  I awakened in about 3 hours, went to the rest room, and returned to bed.  I was uneasy  and thought I might fall.  I slept another three hours and went to the bathroom again. I felt a little better. I got up in about two more hours and felt a little better. Didn?t feel good all day and my arm was really sore.

I went to Clinic Saturday 2/13, for being unbalanced and weak, but not so dizzy. Sunday 2/14 I was extremely weak with low blood pressure and fast heart rate.  Monday  2/15, in the morning,  my left arm started hurting, swelling, was feverish, red, itchy and I had a rash at the injection site. I went to my doctor on 2/19 and he stated that maybe I should not get the 2nd vaccine shot. He stated that he was not certain that everything that happened was a result of the vaccine, but that he couldn&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t.

She went to bed around 8:00 PM and then she couldn&#39;t sleep all night.  She kept trying to drink liquid, running fever, hot and opened a window with temp being 30 outside.  She could hardly walk to the bathroom due to the muscle weakness and fear of falling.  She tossed and turned all night long.  She got up and her temp was 99.8, and she was told not to go to PT this morning.  She is being treated for a frozen shoulder.   She feels dehydrated and is drinking water, and going to drink Ginger ale and crackers due to the nausea.

                                                On the evening of the first vaccination, my sister experienced chills and fever. The next morning she experienced a kind of paralysis, could not sit up or stand up, was falling out of bed and out of her chair, had to be carried to the bathroom, although she usually can walk by herself. This lasted about a day. I took her to the ER where they excluded other possible causes of her condition and simiply attributed it to the vaccine. No treatment was prescribed.

Horrible episode.

Vitals, EKG, CT scan, and MRI conducted. MRI showed an acute mild stroke on R side of brain.  Over-night stay was recommended. Echocardiogram was performed the following day and nothing was abnormal.

I went to the doctor and she prescribed some pills called LOSARTAN 25 mg. but they have not done anything, and on the contrary they gave me very bad leg cramps, and a bad pain on my right leg.

I had trouble speaking and lost complete control of my bladder. My husband called 911 and the end stayed with me and took vitals. I was in this state for about 7 hours. After this I continued to be very tired for about 5 days.

MY BUTTOCK AREA WAS EXTREMELY TENSE AND HURT TO STAND OR WALK.  THE PAIN WENT DOWN BOTH OF MY LEGS, MORE PROMINENT ON THE LEFT SIDE.  I HAD BEEN FEELING THAT PAIN FOR A FEW WEEKS, BUT IT WAS A DULL ACHE, NOTHING DEBILITATING.  I HAVE BACK PAIN, BUT THIS WAS INTENSE AND NOT A PAIN I&#39;VE FELT BEFORE.  AS THE DAY WENT ON, IT EVENTUALLY GOT A LITTLE BETTER.  WHEN I AWOKE THE NEXT DAY, I COULD BARELY GET OUT OF BED.  MY DAUGHTER HAD TO TAKE ME TO THE ER BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS SO INTENSE.

                                                Second Covid Response to Moderna  I had a very severe reaction to she second Moderna shot (3/4/2.  I went grocery shopping the afternoon after I had my shot at about 11am.  Everything seemed normal, but after 20 minutes I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone .  I bought the wrong products, I also bought several of the same thing.  I bought products I never would have bought and had never purchased before.  Then I got home and was feeling still like I was in the Twilight Zone. (nothing seemed real).  Soon after I fell on the floor and could not get up.  My leg and back would not work.  Then I started to urinate and could not stop.  Buckets came out and every time I tried to get up, I fell completely flat again.  The urination lasted from early afternoon till about 6:30 pm.  Then I went to bed and stayed there till morning when I could get up and walk.  Meantime I had to wash my bedding, 3 pairs of pajamas and seven pairs of under pants.  One of the times I fell, my foot (which was recovering from a burn across my toes) and I jammed it between the wall and the bed, causing a break.  Also the first night I took the shot, I could not get to sleep until 4am (my cat and I were stuck watching Robo Cop till it ended at 4am.  I?m now in a boot-cast, and will get an x ray tomorrow.  I should let you know I take Sartaline HC, 100 mg once a day and Clonazepan, 1 mg 3 times a day.

My knees, my ankles, my feet and my neck and shoulders and fingers- a squeezing sensation and pain in my entire body and it was that way for the entire day and the next day it was gone. I never had this pain any other time.  I went to my physical therapist that next day after the vaccine because I thought I had done something to my body - he stretched out my back, knees and so with his help maybe it resolved faster than it would have.

                                                Within about 10 minutes experienced heart thumping and light headedness.  Felt overall as though I was hyperventilating, but breathing was normal.  By that evening, I was feeling &#34;not right&#34;.  By the next morning, started chilling, temp was elevated, over all &#34;sick&#34; feeling.  Experienced that until the next afternoon.  Arm was very sore (still is, but better).  Please note that I had Covid starting November 8, was very ill 2 weeks and continued feeling extreme weakness and fatigue for several weeks after.

Finally stopped and was able to make myself move forward. i was fully aware of what was happening but just couldn&#39;t stop it.

                                                On  8th day after after the Moderna COVIDvaccine, I awoke and noted that site of inoculation on left upper arm was very itchy with a 2x3 inch raised, red hive.   I  felt woozy, unsteady, a bit short of breath, a small headache, a bit of nausea,&amp;  fatigued.  These symptoms  subsided gradually over the next 4 days.

                                                After i had my injection about 7 hours later about 4-5 o&#39;clock I was sitting in a chair and I got up and my balance was completely off and I almost fell into glass table. I felt very foggy and my head wasn&#39;t right. I had to hold on to things and I sat down and I kept saying I just didn&#39;t feel right.  I called my daughter and my arm was hurting and I figure that&#39;s what happens, I was getting so tired and really bad headaches. My daughter asked somebody and they told me to take extra strength Tylenol (500 mg ) 2 at a time 6 hour intervals. Which i did i got up the next morning and i had to go back to bed i had no energy. I felt horrible. When i did get up in the afternoon all of a sudden i had horrible chills and that day in Florida it was 82 degrees and i put the heat on 84 and i was extremely shaky and cold. I went back to bed and later i did have a fever, not highs, it only went to 100.8 but during the evening it did break because my sheets were almost saturated. Yesterday morning 1/27 Wednesday i felt better, fever had gone down, pain was still there in my arm and swelling. I thought that was natural. In the afternoon i decided to take a shower and i noticed my left arm around the injection site was a red rash about 7inches long and 4-5 inches wide which  i had to seen before i called my primary doctor just to make sure this was normal around injection site and talked to the nurse and she thought it was normal. But if there was no changes to call her back on Friday. Last night not able to sleep i saw an article that said COVID arm rash seen after Moderna vaccine, annoying but harmless it was a large article and it made me feel better but there were only 14 examples but they believe there were more because they were younger people with the health dept. that received this vaccine. It said in 1week it should go away.  I still have it, its still red and sometimes itchy and i am happy to say now that i know it will be a week i feel better. it should be on the list of side effects for all.

About 7 hours later i got up from chair and i was dizzy and my balance was off and i almost fell into table. I didn&#39;t feel right. I went and sat back down and i was very tired and i started getting headache. I called my daughter and a nurse she knows told me to take extra strength Tylenol 500 mg take 2 every 6 hours. I started at 730 and went until 130. I slept on and off and got up Tuesday and my arm was still hurting. I was very tired and had no energy. When i got up later in the afternoon i had extreme chills. It was 83 degrees in Florida nd i turned heat up to 84 and i was still shaking. I got under covers and had a fever it was 100.8. Went to sleep that night and fever broke. Got up Wednesday and felt a little better, still had headache and tired. Decided to take a shower. I noticed my left arm where the injection was was all red. 6-7 inches long and about 5 inches wide which i never saw before. after shower I called my PCP I contacted the nurse said she thought it was normal and if there was no  change to call her back on Friday. my arm is still red and warm i went to sleep but couldn&#39;t sleep. I saw an article about COVID arm rash seen after Modern vaccine and now i know that&#39;s what I had. I feel better after I read it in the magazine today and it said it will only last a week. This should be listed as a side effect so nobody else wonders what it is. I drank so much water because it said to drink plenty of water and i tried to use arm as much as possible.

We have fillers that help so much to be able to walk without pain, but this vaccine has caused me to have extreme pain and burning and not be able to walk without pain for 4 days now. NO ONE has said anything about how this Moderna vaccine would  affect us because of the Hyaronolic Acid injections to our knees. We should have been allowed to get Pfizer!!!! I am so upset about this and extremely disappointed in our government&#39;s lack of disclosure.

                                                I had Covid on 25 Nov. 2020.  I had extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, aching, headaches and abdominal pain. I have IBS which flared up during this time.  It took me December and January to finally get over the fatigue part. When I received my vaccination on Feb. 12, 2021 (Moderna) by that evening I began to run a temp. of 102-103. I had chills, headache, abdominal pain (worse than in Nov.), fatigue, some dizziness, and short of breath. I felt like I had Covid all over again!  I was down for 5 days. On Sunday afternoon, Feb 14 I went to the Clinic to see the doctor on call.  I was told they could not test me since I had Covid November 25 and it hadn&#39;t been 90 days and I would still have the antibodies.

I took two Tylenol and went to bed.  I got up two times during the night to go to bathroom.  I felt more achy all over and unsteady on my feet. Did not want to get out of bed next day, so slept until noon.  At noon my temperature was 100.4. I took 2 Tylenol every 6 hours.  Had a very achy, miserable day and just rested.  Was somewhat better by bedtime and had a better next night of sleep. Next day am still achy but much better.

                                                I am starting this report with the current status of my, nearly, 6-week ordeal of  agonizing pain, doctor appts. debilitation, pain meds, a blood test and the final  MRI  this past Saturday, 3/6.  Finally, an MRI has confirmed physician&#39;s recent suspicion that my  second Moderna vaccination was improperly administered. In fact, it tore a  tendon in my right shoulder. I knew something was wrong when I saw how high  the needle was injected into my arm/shoulder. I just didn&#39;t know what the  ramifications would be.  I have been referred to a surgeon, and my appt. is 3/16).  Summary of Events:  On 2/1/21, I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine and had 2 days  of moderate pain and soreness.  But about 3 days later, 2/4, I awoke to excruciating shoulder/arm pain that had  me sobbing out loud. I took Tylenol and waited. Nothing. I took more Tylenol and  slowly the pain diminished. For an hour or so.  All I could do was lie on the couch, literally, groaning and unable to lift my arm  By evening, the only relief I could get was from an old (hip surgery) Oxycodone pill. I took 1/4 piece and slept the night.  Friday and Saturday I was totally debilitated. I couldn&#39;t lift my arm, care for my  dog or do anything but lie on the couch, still sobbing, until small pieces of the  Oxy set in again.  It was the weekend, and I didn&#39;t want to bother anyone but I never felt such pain  for such an extended time or survived so long on meds.  Monday morning, 2/8/21, I called my Doctor. I was very  concerned and really wanted to make sure this pain was still from the vaccine  and not some &#34;weird&#34; condition that might have hit me. The office told me the  pain was probably from the vaccine and advised me to keep taking Tylenol. So it  continued, on and off, relief and agony. I was sure it would stop. It didn&#39;t.  Thursday, 2/11, I saw the Doctor, in person.  Physician did not have an answer for the pain but gave me a prescription for  Celebrex and did a blood test to see if there was a bacteria infection that might  have invaded the area. We would wait for results. Another weekend of pain but  lessened a bit.  Around 2/13, a neighbor called me with an article he found about the SAME  situation MANY people were suffering (thousands) and LAWSUITS pending!! I  didn&#39;t know what was happening to me but the Gov&#39;t did. The article was found  on internet, 2/12, and printed an article from news paper, 2/12  No  other reports appeared anywhere. The pertinent findings of the article: thousands of vaccinated people (Covid and  flu) have reported similar pain and debilitation. The previous gov&#39;t has  introduced a law prohibiting lawsuits (l think against the pharmas but not the  administering agencies. Not sure.) that was to go into effect, 2/23. Again, not sure  of details.  But no one knows about this - people NEED to know. I immediately notified my  family and close friend about my situation. While the cause is not certain, it is  suspected that improper injection technique/training/experience is to blame.  To get the word out, I posted on social media, wrote representatives, etc.   And now I found you. The information must be made available; not to stop  vaccinations but to alert the public if they occur.

                                                Sudden dizziness with some nausea and cold drenching sweat - no fever - extremely weak and fatigued and could barely stand and then severe headache came on about 10 minutes into episode.  Dizziness lasted approximately 2 hours until I could safely move and then began to subside.  I noticed my eyes did not want to focus well and was seeing spots when I tried writing down what happened.  Chills began and I felt extremely cold, my head felt &#34;foggy&#34; and tight, ringing in ears started and headache moved to migraine level.  Slight fever 99.8. Main dizziness did pass after about 2 hours but other things continue to linger on an off.  I just feel &#34;off&#34;.  I have actually heard other seniors mention some of these very symptoms so am not super alarmed, however, I did not have any of these side effects before the vaccine for Covid-19.  I did experience extreme fatigue and bad headaches since I received the first dose on January 27, 2021.    I have not called my doctor regarding these side effects since I have heard many seniors complain of very similar reactions.  I have rested as much as possible, tried to stay hydrated, and taken Tylenol when needed.  For the dizziness I tried to stay as still as possible and put my head between my knees until it finally passed.

But I have not recovered my previous level of energy, which was already very, very low because of longstanding chronic fatigue syndrome.  My persistent vertigo (since 1989) is also worse than it was, and continues so after 2 weeks from date of first shot.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported by the reporter.    On 02 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012M20A ) in the left shoulder for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 02 Feb 2021, patient believed the vaccine was given too high on her shoulder, and had nausea, fatigue and pain at the injection site (shoulder and arm) which increased with movements, radiating to the upper limb and had trouble sleeping, treated with Tylenol.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The outcome of events were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, stated she was sneezing and coughing few days before receiving her first dose vaccine. Concomitant medications reported included iron, metolazone, nicardipine, simvastatin, torsemide, levothyroxine, glimepiride, apixaban, potassium chloride, acetyl salicylic acid, and donepezil 5mg.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 032L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The route of administration was not provided.  On an unspecified date in Jan 2021 after receiving the first dose vaccine, the patient experienced not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, and didn&#39;t want to get up.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient was losing her balance and confused. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with renal failure, as well as, severe urinary tract infection that was septic.  On an unknown date post hospitalization, the patient tested positive for Covid-19.  Treatment drug administered included Tylenol, Azithromycin, Promethazine, 325mg aspirin, and Vitamin D.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, like not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, confusion, loss of balance, renal failure, severe urinary tract infection that was septic, and Covid-19 positive test were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19.  The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-033912:

EMS personnel recorded that pt had no medical history, no medications, and was allergic to penicillin. Patient continued to feel cold and light headed.    Ambulance arrived and patient care was transferred to the medics.  Medics then transported the female to  hospital.

Then I didn&#39;t worry about till the 01/18/2021 in the evening and it felt warm and it was a big patch of red (looked like a rash) about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide like a oval shape. On Tuesday 01/19/2021 I called my doctor,  spoke with nurse what was going on. Doctor told her to put cold compresses on the site 15 minutes on and then 15 minutes off and take Tylenol as needed. The area is still warm and the redness area is still there.    Did go to local grocery store and spoke with pharmacist who advised her to contact VAERS.

Previous dose of COVID vaccine had created a similar response but she had just adjusted medications and attributed it to that. In this case she had taken all her medications. Took rx medication for high BP while being monitored but BP increased to 201/104. Her PCP was notified and she took a second dose of her BP medication. By 1500 her BP had improved to 155/89 and she was no longer dizzy. Taken home with instructions to follow up with PCP if symptoms return or worsen.

                                                The patient was administered the Moderna  Covid-19 vaccine on 1/14/2021. The patient reported experiencing arm pain around the injection site during the 2 days following the vaccination. The patient reported experiencing hip pain and trouble with her legs on 1/21/2021. On 1/22/2021 the patient reported not being able to stand without bracing. The patient visited a doctor on 1/25/2021 and there was suspicion for inflammation of the spinal cord leading to the patient being prescribed prednisone for 6 days. The patient visited the doctor again on 2/2/21 and another course of prednisone was initiated. The patient reports that she can stand from a sitting position without help getting up about half the time and that she had no such trouble standing prior to the vaccination. The patient returned to the second vaccination clinic on 2/11/2021, which was  4 weeks after receiving the first dose, to report her symptoms. The patient was not administered the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

The 4th day I remember thinking I felt dizzy again, and the next thing I knew I was on the floor and hit my head really hard. I think I must have passed out for a nano second. (The first time in my life!) On the 8th day, Feb. 14th, I got a rash on the injection site. It was red, swollen, hot and shaped like a square about 2 inches diameter. I haven&#39;t had an event since.

Later in the afternoon, my right arm where I had the vaccine was very painful, reducing the ability to raise my arm, which continued through the following day.  On Day 3, it was still a bit sore, but improving. On Day 4, I was totally fine.

I had covid in August 2020 and the wasn?t made aware of the possible side effects if you had covid. They didn?t ask if I had covid in the past and the pharmacist told me later that people who has had covid has reported having bad side effects. I had gone a couple weeks ago to see if I had the covid antibodies and I was positive for antibodies and the injection works against the antibiotics. This part of the procedure was overlooked. I have no one else to help me and going through this alone, it would have been better to have been made aware of this ahead of time.

                                                1:45 pm January 5, next day I was pretty good but started running a fever. 99.5 and stayed at that temp until 12th - went up to 101.3 and I was very dizzy. Dizziness was just for 24 hours. January 14th - at 6:00 pm - my temperature 100.9 and it started going down after that. It fluctuated to 99.5 to normal up and down - evening when temperature would come back up. I took 1 acetaminophen (phone call to dr told me to take it) to get temperature down when it was 101 but all the rest of the time I just counted on the aspirin that I take at night to help. Have to call the doctor to get the Lot numbers for the dose. Feb2 - was when I was took second dose and I was recovered from 1st dose.

Top of foot and all along the outside side of it both on top and at bottom of foot all very painful. Ankle and leg very swollen and painful. Can&#39;t walk on foot.  As of 2/26/2021  swelling is not as bad and not so discolored but still some swelling and redness burning and very painful and still cannot use the foot.  Also have noticed places where  I have had surgery or injuries is hurting and being stiff. Am questioning whether or not I should get the 2nd shot. Concerned it will make situation even worse.

                                                After the second shot, I expected mild side effects and experienced some: mild headache, sore left arm around injection site, fatigue, brain fog. I was walking to my garage with a small package of papers when suddenly my lower back spasmed sharply. The pain was intense. I thought it would subside so I managed, with difficulty, to make it into my car. When I was seated in the car, the spasms subsided. I considered not driving to my two errands but decided that I felt well enough seated in the car to drive and deliver the papers to my tax preparer  and the carful of donations to Goodwill. At the tax office, I called an assistant to come to the parking lot to pick up the papers, which she did. At Goodwill, one of the attendants emptied my car. When I got home at about 10:50, I had to call my husband to help me into the house. I spent the next several hours in agony (11 on a scale of 1-10) with spasms, punctuated by absolutly not moving. The spasms were so bad I could not breathe. My doc prescribed a muscle relaxer, then the next day prednisone, which has helped. Today I will have an mri to determine if the spasms herniated a disc.

She took 2 Tylenol, and went back and laid down.  She then awoke the next day starting to have some chills but not as bad as the night before.  She covered up with an electric  blanket in a chair and finally passed over.  She noticed  Saturday that she had nausea and dizziness.  She then had  tenderness in her mouth, used warm salty water which seems to be helping.  She cannot eat any hard food on it due to the discomfort.  She has continued nausea in the evenings.  No problems with the arm where she got the vaccine.  She feels it it getting some better, but the dizziness and nausea is the worst issue.  She did call her doctor and they told her that they could not give her anything for the rash in her mouth, and the chills. They told her that it had to run it&#39;s course.

                                                When I got the vaccine it hurt so much that I jumped. It felt like it burned for like 3min. The next day I had shortness of breath &amp; I fainted the next thing I seen when I woke up was the paramedics taking me in to the ambulance to do an EKG. Everything was good except my blood pressure dropped. I was not taken to the hospital.

                                                About 9 days after my 1st dose of Moderna vaccine, I began to have itching on my right upper arm in the area of the injection.  That continues today.  Two days after I noticed the itching, the upper arm was hot to the touch, red, and swollen.  The area is about 6&#34; in diameter.  I did not have an elevated temperature, but I felt slightly nauseous and light-headed on March 5.    I had no reaction to the shot until a week and a half to two weeks after the injection.   I still have a red, itchy area on my right arm.  It seems to be slowly improving.

She went to the ER with no treatment. About 5-6 hours after discharged she returned with her leg turning purple and uncontrollable pain. She was diagnosed with venous thromboembolis and transferred to a larger facility where she underwent lytic therapy and venous angioplasty. She is having to go for venous stenting in the next two weeks. She continues to have pain in her leg, chronic fatigue and weakness, as well as being lightheaded with a stable BP (no orthostasis). She has been diagnosed with anemia since vaccination and is being worked up for that.

                                                On the second day, I had to drive to get the car serviced. When I got home I was very dizzy, got out of the car took 12 steps backward I was so dizzy it did not end in a fall.. I went into my house and tried to eat and it turned my stomach just to look at food. I lay down and slept until 10 am the next day. Now when I get up in the morning I am too dizzy to walk to the bathroom. I must wait 5 minutes before getting on my feet.

As time went on she started burping loudly and developed nausea. She also has developed a headache and has a low fever of 101.5. This all continues until now, 48 hours after the injection and she is still dizzy in bed with the above symptoms.

                                                Day of injection arm a little sore. Next day (Friday) felt perfectly fine and spent the day at home doing usual house cleaning and laundry. Felt fine in the evening and Saturday morning was extremely fatigued, loss of equilibrium, and elevated blood pressure. This condition remained for a few days and on Tuesday my pressure was somewhat down and I saw my doctor. He suggested that since I was doing a little better had NO other symptoms such as fever or chills or muscle aches I would be better in time. It was a rough week feeling so unlike my self but I pushed through. I see the doctor again on Tuesday the 26th. I have never had any reaction to any other vaccine such as flu or shingles vaccine at any time. I am an active woman who exercises and walks to the beach near my home frequently every week. I am anxious about the second dose of the vaccine. I have an appointment on Thursday, February 4th. Hopefully all my strength will have returned by then. I feel like I&#39;m still only 80% back to normal. I have spoken to a young woman who called me back. I would like very much to speak with a medical person who can give me some feedback on my response to the vaccine. That would be reassuring that I am not alone with these side effects. Thank you.

                                                SYMPTOMS: SEVERE, SORE/STIFF LEFT ARM - COULD NOT RAISE MY ARM TO TAKE MY SHIRT OFF AT NIGHT - HAD NO MOBILITY.  SUBSIDED OVER A PERIOD OF 72&#43; HOURS.  1 WEEK LATER THE SEVERE SORE/STIFF SITUATION REAPPEARED, COULD NOT TAKE MY NIGHTGOWN OFF THE NEXT MORNING AND COULD NOT PUT A SEATBELT ON OR DRIVE, DRY MYSELF AFTER A SHOWER, ETC.... THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

She said her head hurt and she could move all her limbs.  I asked the store director, to call for an ambulance.  I sit with her for a few minutes and talked to her, then asked store director to stay with her until the ambulance arrived.  They arrived and spoke with her and decided to transport her to the hospital.  Later that day, her sister in law came by and said she was doing fine and had been released.

I did feel fine until I got severe chills about 6 PM.  Chills remained for several hours.  Went to bed with heavy covers.  Woke up about 2 AM with stomach not feeling well.  Was dizzy walking into kitchen getting a Sprite.  Set in recliner with heavy covers.  Took my blood pressure at 5AM &amp; it had dropped to 104 /44 which was apparently why I was so dizzy.   I then took a Tylenol and felt fine after 9AM.  I still feel fine but wanted to report my extremely low blood pressure which usually is 135/65 in mornings.    I&#39; m thankful for the vaccine.

                                                I became progressively more sleepy the afternoon after the vaccination, as expected.  I did get up and make dinner, then went to bed at 9:15 p.m. on March 8th and slept until 9:15 a.m. March 9th.  I felt unstable walking into the bathroom to urinate, and even more unstable waking into the kitchen to take my meds. I passed out and woke up on the floor.  I was weak but managed to pull myself up holding on to the kitchen range. I headed for the living room sofa and passed out again, waking up on the floor by the sofa.  I&#39;m guessing I was unconscious about 2 minutes each time, but don&#39;t really know. I lay down on the sofa and called a neighbor.  He thought I should call 911, and they came and drove me to  ER .  They did an EKG, chest x-ray, and CAT scan of my brain, and drew blood.  All results were normal. I returned home that same day (March 9)  and had little energy, and ate lightly.  When I was getting in bed about 10:30 p.m. I let my head drop on the pillow and the room started to whirl around me for about six seconds.  Sometimes when I roll over in bed during the night there is a pause before   it feels like the room gives one spin.  My scalp is very tender in the large area where I hit it twice when passing out.  I&#39;m taking it easy again today, but do feel a little stronger.  I am normally exceptionally healthy for my age, and work , traveling to destinations to research and photograph my articles. Both the travel and article take stamina, and I thrive on the work.

                                                Whenever I move my head I get very dizzy. I had a very negative response to the second Moderna shot and ran a fever and was unable to get out of bed the next day. This continued for about 24 hours. I am still experiencing intervals of dissiness to this day. I have been taking over the counter motion pill to alleviate the problem. They help somewhat.

                                                Immediate reaction was the headache at the time of the vaccine, and has had headaches on and off but nothing like the initial one.   Started to get dizzy and felt weird on the ride home from the vaccine.  The headache lasted a fairly long time and got tired by the evening and the next morning.  The headache has still continued a  little off and on until now, 2/17/21.  The dizziness has gone away, the feeling &#34;out of it&#34; feeling has gone away, does not feel well about the concentration.  The tiredness and fatigue started the day after the vaccine and has gotten worse, has to drag herself through the day and by 1:00 PM is done through the day due to the fatigue.  Some days can go to 4:00 but most days only lasts until 1:00.  She gets up at 7:30 and today at 10:37 has the feeling of tiredness.  The gland under her arm a couple of weeks ago was swollen, which is still sensitive but not as bad as it was.  The fatigue is the main thing that continues to bother her.  She has not taken anything for these reactions.   She has seen her doctor, and is supposed to get some blood tests today, 2/17/21.

Extremely unsteady on feet.  She had slept  from 5pm to 9am.  After breakfast and an hour she regained her knowledge of her name and mine and could correctly recite her DOB.  She continues to have difficulty ambulating complaining her legs ache.  She is also extremely tired.

                                                By afternoon I felt a little chilly and achy and took Tylenol.  I woke at 2:00am the following morning to go to the restroom and my dog needed to go out.  I felt light headed as soon as she was back in the house.  I felt things going dark and I passed out in the hallway.  I don&#39;t know how long I was out but when I came to, I felt like I couldn&#39;t move.  I laid there for a while and finally crawled back to my bed.  I was able to get back in bed.  By then it was 3:00am.  The next night I woke in the night and had an irregular heartbeat.  I could not get back to sleep until it finally went away.  For several days after the vaccination, I had very little energy.

                                                Beginning about 4 hours after receiving shot, muscle aches in arm, from elbow radiating up the arm, over the shoulder thru collarbone &amp; up the side of the neck to the ear.  By 6 hours after the shot, pain was excruciating and I was in literal Agony for the next 8 hours. It felt like a hot poker was being pushed along that pathway.   Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen had no effect.  I could not sleep &amp; could barely move the arm  at all.  (I am Not a pain Wimp)  I would say this was the longest lasting without relief/strongest pain I have ever experienced and I have had one child;&#43; hip &amp; shoulder surgery which required almost no after surgery medication at all.  By 5 a.m. I was able to sleep a bit &amp; most of the extreme pain was gone by 8 a.m.  I had some headache the following day and was barely able to function (I live alone) just from all over tiredness.  About 36 hours after injection, I was back to normal.

Went to bed, with 2 @400 mg. Tylenol boosted during the night with Tramadol 50 mg.   Was able to drive &amp; swim in the morning (21 hours) post. 24 hours post: extreme fatigue (kept falling asleep), then felt like I&#39;d been run over by a rototiller. Aches in joints, body, and skin.  2 @ 400 mg Tylenol alleviated symptoms enough to sleep for 2 hours. Arose at 3:30 pm feeling better. Not great, but better ! Better enough to feed animals and prepare dinner for myself.

I had Extreme fatigue, nausea, headache, balance was off, muscle and nerve and back pain.  Just took covid test and just got results--Negative. (3-19-21)  The symptoms subsided March 12.  Still vaguely experiencing all of them.   Should I take the 2nd shot.  Feel those results would return at an even heightend level.  Pharmacist said I was probably 85 % covered now with these effects from the 1st shot and should not take the 2nd.  My Dr.  said the 2nd shot was my call to make and that I should report it to CDC.

I was very weak and unsteady.  I did improve slowly.  By morning I could walk cautiously.   Seem to be ok now.

                                                The morning after the 2nd dose, I got up to make coffee.  I had just started and felt a bit light-headed.  I was going to go sit down, but I passed out and fell onto the kitchen floor for a few  seconds.   I have never passed out before or felt such light-headedness.  I went to lay down.   I vomited a bit of liquid.  I lay down and several hours later my husband drove me to the emergency room.  After many tests they said I had suffered a Syncope and had a slight concussion.

No official diagnosis, treat as  ITP.   Follow up visits with oncologist/haematologist to keep an eye on platelets as they increase.   March 30-Apr 4 - ER visit due to swelling of ankles, feet, and left arm. Tests show superficial blood clot, fluid on lungs, and pneumonia. Oncologist said that &#34;we have no official diagnosis&#34;, that she&#39;s being treated for ITP.   April 6-14 - follow up visit to oncologist/haematologist show elevated kidney enzymes, then later liver enzymes,  low sodium.   April 14 - decision to move to short term rehab for regular PT and OT. Continued swelling (fluid in third spaces.)   April 21 - visit to cardiologist to perform cardioversion, successful (during first week of hospital stay, heart rhythm med had to stop).   April 23 - facility nurse discovered significantly low Hemoglobin and a blood transfusion was ordered.    April 24 - returned to short term rehab facility.   April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to &#34;get it out of her system.&#34; Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

                                                My shot was Saturday at 2 PM.    Monday night I developed a VERY tender, sore achilles tendon.  I could barely walk Tuesday.  I kept working it up and down and I do not excercise,   so it&#39;s certainly NOT from overuse.   I have never had this problem before   I can remember at one time taking some meds that the warnings said they could cause problems with tendons. . so , I&#39;m wondering if this could be because of my shot on Monday.   Hence, the report.

She stated that around 1pm yesterday that she got really dizzy so she took some medication that she had for dizziness, she had it for a previous fall d/t dizziness.  She stated that the medication helped, but around 8pm yesterday her head felt like it was going to explode and her heart was racing, so she called her daughter and her daughter called the ambulance and she was taken to the ER.  She said they ran a bunch of tests at the ER, including a CT scan, she is doing okay now, and is at home.  She stated that she is calling because she does not want to get the 2nd dose of COVID vaccine because she does not want to go through that again.  Client stated that she lives alone but her daughter checks on her frequently.

Went home and took Benadryl (50 mg) 2 tablets at 9:30 am,1:30 pm and 5:15 pm, mistakenly believing they were 25mg tabs because of packaging change and miniscule text on bottle and difficult to find directions.

She went to bed, and all night and into the next day had fever/chills.  She got up during the night to get some water she collapsed and could not get up as she was so weak.  Her husband found her and helped her back to bed.  Today, 2/22/21 she is better today and feels almost to normal.   She took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea.   Tylenol/Ibuprofen did not take the headache, but it did finally go away.   The headache was on the top of her head.

THEN, after the second doxe on Feb 10, about 12 days later, I once again experienced vertigo which lasted 4 days and experienced dizziness for days afterwards including today as I write this report. The dizziness does decrease daily but is worse in the morning and diminishes as the day proceeds.

She does have life alert and the fire department broke into the house and she was taken to the ER.  In the ER they gave her IV fluids, checked her vital signs.  They did not do anything unusual to her.  She was then released after 4-5 hours.  She is feeling much better, still a little weak but otherwise fine.

When we were going home they told me I was swerving, all over the road and they told me to stop, they would drive, I said no, i don&#39;t trust anyone with my car. We got home, I remember changing into my nightgown and was texting someone and I suddenly I stopped. After that I was unresponsive. I would not answer anyone, they said I looked pale and stared into the air. They called my children and they came and emergency personnel was called. I was taken to a hospital and they transferred me to another hospital. I stayed there for 3-4 days. After going home it took me some days to be able to walk without assistance. I wanted to say I had covid in May (1st time) and September (2nd time) . I still do not have taste or smell back from the covid. I can only eat 3 or 4 bites and then I am done.

EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

Slowly was able to slide across the floor to where phone was charging. Called my daughter (15 minutes away). She helped lift me into a chair.  My mind was clear the whole time. She finished making my coffee, I moved to sit on the couch. Began to feel normal, maybe weak, not like dancing but normal. She left. Rested, drank water, felt fine but kept my phone with me.

                                                Daughter   provided the information for her elderly mother who, at this time, was being evaluated in the ED at Medical Center .   3/5/21 -  approximately 16.5 hrs after her mother&#39;s second dose of Covid 19 vaccination, she woke up very weak and felt very tired.  3/6/21 Patient noticed rash (not raised) but reddened in the left upper arm where the injection was given.  She stated it was oval in appearance and covered most of the upper arm.  She noted a lump in her underarm of the left axilla also.  Denied any fever or other symptoms and otherwise felt fine.  On 3/9/21 she noticed a lump in the groin area and noticed that walking was a little more difficult than usual since both of her knees bothered her.  3/12/21Pt went to orthopedic surgeon and had a &#34;cortisone injection&#34; in the right knee.   This afternoon, the patient&#39;s daughter suggested that she go a local Urgent Care because the patient stated that the lump (previously in groin area)  &#34;was moving.&#34;  She waited in there for over one hour and then a nurse came out and told her to go to the ED for evaluation of her left upper arm for the redness and swelling.  She went directly to the ED and is being evaluation and having bloodwork done.  Daughter said if the lab results are normal, her mother will be discharged with an oral antibiotic and benadryl

I had no strength and was unable to get up.  Each time it only lasted a few seconds or minutes.  It was sort of like I fainted but stronger.  I had spent most of the day resting as I had a very bad headache but that was about gone when I had the two spells.  I had also had a small patch of hives (fever and swelling) about the size of my hand at the site of the shot.  That lasted about a week after each shot.   I thought this was something I should report.  Thanks.

So her husband kept her in bed all day and by Friday morning things didn&#39;t get any better, and he helped her to get to the end of the bed and went into the kitchen to get breakfast and he heard her fall, and she fell off the bed and was semi-consciousness, and was able to get her back into the bed and called the ambulance.   She was taken to the hospital Friday morning and she&#39;s still in there.  She has been diagnosed with hydronephrosis, and they keep going back and forth on her diagnoses.  At first they said that she had a UTI, and then they said she didn&#39;t, and then said that she did.  The son feels that all three of the doctors feel that it was some sort of reaction to the vaccine.  They did give her steroids at one time, and she developed severe tremors when she moved which have subsided.  She also has had fever, in a weakened state due to this condition.  She is still being treated for this still and said that she will be having to go to rehabilitation before going home.

She started feeling very weak and dizzy. This was very sudden.  Up to the first fall, she was strong enough to go up and down the stairs several times a day with no assistance, and she could walk about a mile with her walker.

                                                On January 29,2021 at about 9 am I experienced extreme total body weakness as though I was about to faint. I managed to lie down. Concurrent with the extreme weakness I felt intense nausea. The weakness and nausea lasted for approximately 45 minutes to one hour when I had to rush to the toilet for a bowel movement. Within an hour to an hour and one half I was totally asymptomatic. There was no recurrence of the GI symptoms or exteme weakness. At the same time I felt itching at the site of the Covid 19 vaccination. When the GI symptoms and weaknes subdided and I looked at my upper left arm, there was swelling and redness surrounding the vaccination site and around the side of my left arm. The itching, swelling and redness lasted for 24 hours and began to subsdide until it was only faintly recognizable as a light pink discoloration around the original vaccination site. Today, February 6th, 2021 the redness has almost completely faded.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA          I woke up sat.  01/30  with severe Vertigo.  This lasted till early mon. morning.   The dizziness left but I was so weak, I was in bed for one more day.  By tues. I felt better, but it took till thurs. to feel normal again.    I&#39;m   wondering if this was a reaction since it took three days to  start.     I did notify my dr.  Dr. to see if he thought it might be covid rather than a reaction, but he opted to wait 24 hours &amp; check back with me for a Covid test.  Since I was feeling better every day, we let it go.   My question is  should I receive the second shot?

                                                Bad headache, very stuffy nose, I couldn&#39;t breathe and almost went to the hospital. Ears were ringing, my eyes were ready to pop out of my head. Temples hurt, lymph glands were swollen, sore throat. Mostly in upper part of anatomy above collar bone. It made me very weak, I had trouble getting out of rocking chair to answer phone. So I took another Tylenol. I usually only take 1-2 Tylenol a day and that was my second one by the middle of the day. I had to lay down and I live alone so I was nervous and had phone beside me and debated calling 911 which I have never done. I dozed and when I woke up about a couple of hours later it was much better. Still had headache and a little stuffiness but anybody can handle that. Also, I was very nauseated and couldn&#39;t eat but I did drink water.

She had water and cold compress. I sat with her and her caretaker for another 15 minutes or so.  The caretaker left to bring car around and we used wheelchair to help her to car.  She never did pass out, and was feeling a little better.  The caretaker was going to stay with her to keep a watch over her.  Patient called a couple of hours later to let us know she was doing ok and had been lying down.  She wasn&#39;t having the chest tightness anymore and her head felt better, but she had developed a rash across the chest.

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

AS SYMPTOMS STARTED FOLLOWING DAY. 9 DAYS LATER I WENT TO MY DOCTOR AND SHE SAID THEY JUST DID NOT KNOW FOR SURE IF THE VACCINATION WAS THE TRIGGER FOR THE PSEUDO GOUT. SHE TREATED ME WITH 3 PILLS OF PREDNISONE 20 MG 1 PILL A DAY. IF CONDITION DID NOT IMPROVE SHE WOULD ADVISE MORE MEDICATION. AM ON SECOND DAY OF MEDICATION. SOME OF THE SWELLING HAS GONE DOWN BUT STILL PAINFUL. CAN USE MY RIGHT HAND A LITTLE AS YESTERDAY I COULD NOT LIFT A FORK.

                                                My mom lhad been up walking around for maybe an hour or so.  She then laid down across the bed &amp; when I looked at her, she was drenched with sweat, then she started hacking, almost like she was choking or couldn&#39;t breathe.  She also started mumbling &amp; called on Jesus.  I tried sitting her up, her eyes then rolled back in her head, then this very gold colored stuff started coming out of her mouth (which scared me to death).  Her body was so limp, she slid on the floor.  I wiped her mouth &amp; also put a cold rag on her  forehead to try to cool her down.  I dialed 911 &amp; continued talking to her.  She started to respond to me &amp; along with my help we were able to sit her back on the bed.  EMS arrived, took her vitals.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had no pain or soreness, but the area was a little tender if you pushed, and she waited one hour in the hospital afterwards.  As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again. Consent given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, area was a little tender and had some bruising near eye, were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 84 year old female patient with medical history including atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                The morning after vaccination, she felt extremely  and unusually fatigued. After getting up from bed and eating her usual breakfast, she was returning to her bedroom when she became dizzy and fainted, falling to the floor, hitting her head and suffering other effects, including rhabdomyolysis from being on the floor for a long time after the fall as she was unable to get up. She was transported to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days. She was treated with IV fluids, Tylenol and a short course of antibiotics. While hospitalized, she had a repeat of a rash/swelling at injection site that began about 48 hours after vaccination.  The hospital treated the rash with some barrier cream and within 48, the redness, rash and swelling abated.

                                                The morning after vaccine was administered my mother woke up in the morning blacked out resulted in a fall on her left arm that caused a fractured clavicle. The dizziness and vertigo continue through the day Along with chills and nausea throughout the day. My biggest concern was the dizziness which has never happened before. I took her to the emergency room which resulted in a diagnosis of a fractured and displaced clavicle . The dizziness was the most concerning part and they ruled out any cerebrovascular causes. A meclizine 25 mg was given and also prescribe for her when she was discharged. I am a registered pharmacist and is a healthcare provider I looked into the side effects listed. Vertigo and dizziness is not commonly communicated as a adverse effect. This is so concerning for the elderly patients regarding  potential falls which can lead to fractures and be detrimental to their health.That?s exactly what happened to my mother

The dizziness came back even stronger shortly that afternoon after my shot. As of today, March 3rd 2021, I am still feeling light headed.

I very suddenly became light-headed and felt like I could pass out .  I sat down on a chest and put my head down on the foot of the bed and hoped it would pass.  About a minute later I became very nauseated and thought I would vomit.  I  waited about 15 min and did not do so.   I went back to bed and stayed quiet for the rest of the night.  The 24th I was extremely tired and slept most of the day.  When I did get up briefly I ached all over.  This gradually ceased by the next day.   These symptoms did not return. I am very active and know no other reasons for the reaction.

She did have soreness at the injection site, running a small fever, but  nothing that was too bad.

I very suddenly became light-headed and felt like I could pass out .  I sat down on a chest and put my head down on the foot of the bed and hoped it would pass.  About a minute later I became very nauseated and thought I would vomit.  I  waited about 15 min and did not do so.   I went back to bed and stayed quiet for the rest of the night.  The 24th I was extremely tired and slept most of the day.  When I did get up briefly I ached all over.  This gradually ceased by the next day.   These symptoms did not return. I am very active and know no other reasons for the reaction.

                                                She awakened in the middle of the night feeling much pain in arm where injection was. Felt like she would throw up but couldn&#39;t move from the bed. Felt like her face was drawn and tight. This morning, she has been very shaky, sounds like some congestion in her chest (cough), very tired, very dry mouth. She is never sick, so this is alarming to her and to me.

During the week Wednesday, left eyelid was swollen, and then before going to bed both were swollen.  Seem to have gotten better.  Went to the doctor and advised to not take the 2nd vaccine.  Has had light headedness and dizziness since the day after the vaccine, still having some symptoms.

The worst has been the increasing tremors in my head and hands.  This is what I am most concerned about. I have a history of tremors, but since the vaccine, there has been a marked increase in the tremors. I did not report this right away because I thought it would go away, but now on the eve of my second shot I am very nervous that it will get even worst.  My physician encourages me to continue and get through the side effects than to get COVID with my underlying lung condition. I want to take the vaccine but am nervous that I am experience so much shakiness even a month after the first shot. Would you advise me to take the second shot? My shot is scheduled for tomorrow, February 17.

The pt reported 2 episodes of SOB and lightheadedness, with the second one as the more severe. On her second episode, she felt severe shortness of breath, tried to walk quickly to her bed with her walker, and fell into her bed. CT angio demonstrated acute saddle PE, mild right heart strain, RUL pulmonary infarct, and mild multifocal pneumonia with suspicion of COVID; IR was consulted and suggested thrombectomy due to the severity of the embolism. In the ED, she was started on heparin drip and put on low-flow NC oxygen without distress. Upon arrival to the emergency department her vital signs were significant for T 36.4, SBP 120/81, HR 95 bpm, NSR, RR 18, FiO2 94% on room air.  Her oxygen increased to 98% on 2 L nasal cannula.  Her laboratory values revealed WBCs 15.1, Hb 14.4, HCT 43.4, PLT 321, neutrophils 68.8%, D-dimer 4642, NA 134, K3.4, anion gap 9, BUN 17, creatinine 1.00, glucose 163, troponin elevated 0.12, 0.25, and 0.41, urinalysis is unremarkable, COVID-19 swab is positive. A thrombectomy was performed 2/16/2021.  She tested COVID positive on 2/16/2021 and her SpO2 remains in the high 90s with dips to mid 80s while talking, but she does not currently experience any SOB.

                                                She had her vaccine, and 11 days later noticed her stool was very black like tar, and on the side had bright red blood.  She went to the ER and she was admitted.  They did an endoscopic exam but did not find anything.  She then was discharged after a couple of days.  She had an APT with her PCP on 2/9/21 and she had ordered blood work, and nothing changed.  She ordered a repeat blood work on 2/13/21 and said that her count was 6.9, and was told to come in for some blood, and admitted again for a couple of more days.  She had one unit of blood.  She was discharged on 2/15/21.  She saw a gastroenterology NP and she drew blood and her count was 8.4, and advised to start taking some iron.   She does not show any further signs of bleeding, but does feel very weak, feels cold and the usual signs of anemia.   She did have light headedness throughout this entire time as well.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine 15 hours after I received the vaccination (3 AM of the morning of February 24) I went to the bathroom to take two Tylenol for a headache. I then used the toilet and started walking back to bed (less than 20 feet away). About halfway there, I I realized something was wrong. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground right next to my bed. On the way down I think I heard crashing into wood furniture. I don?t know how long I was blacked out; it might have been 10 minutes. I managed to get up onto the bed and felt something wet on my pillow case. It was blood coming from a deep laceration on my chin. My doctor told me to go to urgent care. They sent me to the emergency room. I was kept overnight for observation and give three stitches in my chin. I have felt woozy ever since, but all the tests administered in the hospital showed no damage.

                                                Within the first 24 hours she showed a look of serious aging, and then the following day extreme pain in the mid and left side back making it difficult to walk or move. Severe pain. The pain seem to shift around like more nerve pain showing in the muscle . Started on the left side but moved around.  This was initially helped with some strong curcummin/boswella (inflammation pain formula at our health food store) and a homeopathic remedy. But the symptoms came back and kept going . She is very active and was unable to do her regular routine. She was sleeping more and in considerable pain. After several days, we tried what another country recommends for reactions to vaccines and it seemed to help her within a very short time. There is still now residual pain but she is better.  We have GREAT concern over what a second dose could do and do not feel that with such a strong reaction the second dose safe. Also a great concern that the same amount of vaccine for a 250 pound person and a 100 pound elder. She is very tiny bones and weighs around 100 pounds are less. Very concerning as no medicine is usually the same for everyone. Also a concern of why just one month from second dose when it takes a known 6 weeks for blood to change. A high chance of severe reaction can happen with such a close proximity and a second dose. We would like to see advise of no second shot or considerable less for small people. CDC person recommended she switch vaccines?  That seems risky and there is no studies of adverse reaction to combining two different vaccines.  She would like to be comfortable moving around in public and is of great health for her age so this reaction was very concerning. If she had such a reaction on FIRST DOSE....wouldnt that be a indication that her body reacted and a second dose not necessary  advisable. Please advise. This is of great concern to all of us who love her and of great concern for the general public who may be at risk for such adverse effects. I put unknown below because she still feels some pain even though it is less.

On the 4th day it seemed like I&#39;d been drained and dry, by the 4th week my skin seemed dry and I tried to drink water, my eyes seemed a little deeper set. I went to my PCP and he sent me to a dermatologist.  The dermatologist and he gave me something to bathe in, and I didn&#39;t see any difference.  The spots are not like a rash, but the discoloration seems to be under the skin, its not a rash on top of the skin but underneath.

                                                Was wandering around the house in the middle of the night, after midnight. Went to the kitchen to eat and fell, had to have help getting up. She was too weak to get up on her own. Had no recollection of falling. She went back upstairs to her room and eventually continued wandering around. At 7:15 am she didn?t know if it was morning or night. Shortly after eating she had no recollection of eating. All of this sounds like it would be her normal with Alzheimer?s but she is not at this stage yet. She acted as she did when she had a TIA several years ago.

She had a hard time sitting up, trying to lift her arms, had a hard time articulating how she felt and what was wrong, her speech seemed a little slurred, and she felt nauseated. Her daughter denied facial droop and localizing weakness. She continued to be &#34;out of it&#34; and weak until her daughter put her in bed about 7 hours later. She slept well and got up twice during the night to use the bathroom and seemed ok. She is feeling better today. Pt reports she kept hearing the telephone ringing all night and thought she heard someone yelling about the phone.

                                                Patient previously had dizzy spills, but about a week after receiving the vaccine her dizzy spills began to get worse. The whole prior she kept saying I am just not right. On the 2/7/21 she a COVID test done, a nurse came to her house and preformed. On the morning of the 8th patient was on the phone with someone else and patient asked this person to call me and go check on her. Within 5 minutes I was over at her house, and I found her on the floor, she on her belly facedown. It looked like she was on the toilet, and it looked like she fall getting her off, she was still wet, she still felt warm. I called the ambulance and immediately  began CPR. When EMS arrived they took over the CPR and transported her to the Hospital. The EMS was there for about 40 minutes and used an machine to preform the compressions. She was pronounced deceased at the hospital.  No autopsy was done.

She went to bed that evening and everything was hurting, and felt very nauseous.  She had a very bad nights rest, but when she woke up her temp was over 100, normal is 97.  She did take her morning meds and an extra-strength Tylenol and went back to bed.   She took Tylenol, was feeling better, but still the chills and fatigue and was better.  The problem with the headache continued and her temp was about 99.   On 2/12/21 had temp over 100 again, no energy, slept a lot.   Had difficulty sleeping that night and had sweats, had temp, nausea and was shaking.  On Monday felt shaky, chills and difficulty sleeping.  On Tuesday she was having headache, not sleeping well and no energy.   She also was not sleeping well, had  a headache.  By 2/17/21 was feeling better, not great as she was still not sleeping well.   She did have covid in April of last year, and was not allowed to see her husband who was in a nursing home until 6/3/20.   When she had the covid test she was inconclusive and that&#39;s why she could not see her doctor.   Her doctor did the antibody test that showed she had antibodies.  She is feeling back to normal as of today, 3/8/21.  She had the malaise from COVID after she got the 1st vaccine.  Feels that they should ask people before getting the vaccine if they had COVID.

Pharmacist asked granddaughter to hold patient&#39;s head up. Pulse remained palpable, pharmacist administered 1 dose of 0.3mg epinephrine via epi-pen into patient&#39;s left thigh. Patient quickly regained consciousness, spoke to family, said she didn&#39;t feel well. EMS arrived. Patient began to vomit, was placed on stretcher by EMS and left with EMS. A few hours later the granddaughter reported to us that the patient had a UTI and physical exam by ER attributed her experience to untreated infection.

Then started to feel fatigued to the point of falling down.  Light headed, dizziness with vertigo which is not getting any better.  Has been taking Meclizine which did not help.  Still having the same symptoms, lethargic, cannot get any energy. Took some Tylenol and Ibuprofen about once a day but still having symptoms.

                                                On Saturday while getting your night medicines from the shelf, and started feeling dizzy, tried to reach the shelf and said to herself that &#34;i can&#39;t do it, I just can&#39;t do it&#34;.  She staggered back and sat down on a towel hamper and apparently fell off of that onto the floor, lost kidney function.  Tried to get up and managed to get her phone out and called her husband (he&#39;s hard of hearing - was downstairs).  She said when he got there her head was towards the bathroom door and felt that he could not get in and could not get her up so she tried to get up.  She did not have any strength.  Finally she got up to get on her elbow and crawled into the vanity area and raised up and pulled herself up.  She did not enough strength to walk to the bed.   She got to the bed and then started with chills, turned on her electric blanket.  She felt better Sunday, 1/7/21, and is real shaky today.  She feels a little stronger but is not back to where she wants to be.  Yesterday evening she felt her arm itching a little bit, and looked at it and it was swollen and red, and had an area about the size of her hand.  Her husband felt of it and said that he felt she had fever in it.  The arm was sore to touch.  It is itching a little bit this morning.  She had a headache for a couple of days as well, took a Tylenol one night and her head felt real weird.  It was not real severe, and it hurt more times than it did others.  It would come and go.  Has not taken anything else for these symptoms.   Her husband checked her BP, Friday was 108/62, and last night 106/67.

Is this a huge coincidence or did she have really bad reactions to the covid vaccines?  Should she have been observed for 24 hours afterwards by the assisted living facility, had a family caretaker watch her for 24 hours, Pharmacy should have observed for 24 hours?

                                                After waiting here 15 minutes she got up to walk back to her apartment. She began to feel a little light headed, dizzy, and and warm. She felt like she needed to sit down immediately. Her temperature and BP were check; both were normal. We gave her some water and cold towel to put on the back of her neck then had her sit down for a while longer till she was feeling better. She said she felt immediately better after the water and after a while a facility staff member came to take her home.  As I talked to her she did tell me that she has a history of passing out so this may have played a part in the event.

She reports that approximately 1.5hrs after receiving her COVID vaccine, she began having pain in the top of her head, neck, between her shoulder blades, down both arms to her fingertips, and down her spine.  Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No Reported Past Medical History.) on 15-Mar-2021.   On 15-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (lot of sleepiness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 18-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GAIT INABILITY (unable to stand or walk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), TREMOR (tremors in her legs which as the days progressed spread to her whole body, arms, head, and) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ADVERSE REACTION (reaction may have been a heightened extreme immune response to the second dose of the) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 18-Mar-2021 to 25-Mar-2021 due to ADVERSE REACTION, GAIT INABILITY, SOMNOLENCE and TREMOR. At the time of the report, SOMNOLENCE (lot of sleepiness), GAIT INABILITY (unable to stand or walk), TREMOR (tremors in her legs which as the days progressed spread to her whole body, arms, head, and) and ADVERSE REACTION (reaction may have been a heightened extreme immune response to the second dose of the) outcome was unknown.            No concomitant medications were reported.  No treatments were reported.  During hospitalization, patient underwent numerous tests such as MRI and Xrays to rule out other diagnoses.  All tests came back negative. Pt has been in rehabilitation facility since 26MAR2021. Her tremors are lessening in frequency and intensity.  She is able to walk for short periods of time and use a walker as well.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 88-year-old female hospitalized with serious unexpected events of adverse reaction, somnolence, tremor and gait inability. Event onset the same day as second dose mRNA-1273. Event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

After an undetermined period of time (likely less than 5 minutes), she was able to call me (her daughter).  She could hardly move her mouth but she was able to tell me that she needed help. I arrived about 20 minutes later.  She had full movement at that time and was able to speak.  Her BP was 140/73, HR 60. She was tired but scared to go to sleep around 5pm so we went to the local ER.  Her labs, EKG, and MRI were all normal for her age. Today (1/15/21) at 10:30am, she experience the same thing but only in her face.  She was able to move her arms but not able to talk.  I was with her and could tell that she was fully conscious and aware, just couldn&#39;t move.  It happened again but not as severely after she ate lunch around 12pm.

On Saturday, January 23rd, she was exhausted and unable to get up. We learned this from a friend of hers who had called us back after both my brother and I were unable to reach her by phone.  This was about 3:15 pm and we drove to her apartment and found her semi conscious in her bed. We awoke her but she was unable to talk or get up. We then called 911 and emergency paramedics came and took her to hospital.

                                                My mother has experienced a severe reaction to her vaccine. Diagnosed with brain encephalopathy probably caused by molecular mimicry in response to the Covid vaccine, she is now being treated as an inpatient at the Clinic.  She was fully independent- living alone, mobile, with excellent cognitive function.  On January 21, 2021 she received her 1st Moderna vaccine. Subsequently family noticed small balance changes, slight fine motor coordination changes (handwriting, etc) and a little forgetfulness not previously seen. Everything was chalked up to her being 89 years old.  She remained independent and relatively fully functional.  Patient is now unable to stand without assistance, leans backward when trying to stand, has developed a spastic tremor bilaterally in her arms, and her cognition is completely altered.  Hallucinations, memory loss, can follow some directions but not all, speech clear but inappropriate.  This declines DAILY. As of March 7th, she could not identify immediate family members in a photo. These changes have all occurred within the past few weeks and appear to have an acute underlying cause not related to age.    Medical staff are looking at an autoimmune encephalitis picture based on the antibodies developed from the vaccine attacking the tissue in the brain and spinal cord that resembles the small piece of the vaccine.    She is currently at the Clinic affiliated hospital. At this time, family is contacting Clinic main campus to request further investigation.   Photographic evidence of rapid decline available, but not able to attach to this form:   Available are three pictures of a log patient keeps with her vitals that she was doing every day.  1. Personal log of vital signs pre Covid vaccine/dose 1 - you can see the handwriting is concise, clear, and orderly.   2. Personal log of vitals after Covid dose 1 on Jan. 21 - slight changes in the handwriting and orderliness but still ok.  3. Personal log of vitals after Covid vaccine dose 2  Feb. 17 - note the illegible handwriting, missing entries, and no spatial awareness of line alignment.  Available are three photos of crossword puzzles she does every day.    1. Puzzle dated Feb.12. Demonstrates her ability to accurately fill most answers with clear writing.   2. Puzzle dated Feb.19 shows an ability to fill in only a couple answers with obvious handwriting changes.   3. Puzzle dated Feb. 21 shows inability to complete, and a strange discrepancy between ability and inability- note 29 across and 18 down.  Patients outcome is undetermined as diagnosis/treatment and prognosis are ongoing.

On 13-Mar-2021, the patient experienced OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED (oxygen level was low) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (could not get up or walk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (muscle weakness in her legs) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 14-Mar-2021 to 17-Mar-2021 due to GAIT DISTURBANCE, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS and OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED. The patient was treated with Rehabilitation therapy for Gait disturbance. At the time of the report, OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED (oxygen level was low), GAIT DISTURBANCE (could not get up or walk) and MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (muscle weakness in her legs) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 13-Mar-2021, Blood test: normal (normal) Normal. On 13-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Low.         No concomitant medications were reported.  The treatment information included oxygen for 2-3 days.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Further information has been requested.
