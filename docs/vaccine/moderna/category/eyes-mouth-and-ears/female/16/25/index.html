A few days after that my muscles started twitching and haven&#39;t stopped. I feel like something is crawling under my skin and the vaccine is extremely affecting my nervous system. I did not have this problem before I had the vaccine. It has not gone away and it is now April 23rd I still feel weak, not the same as I used to feel before having the vaccine, and my muscles are twitching all over my body. My face is twitching and my eye and there is nothing I can do to make it stop. I am so young and I thought the vaccine was safe but I am suffering from it. Especially in my feet I feel like they are tingling and vibrating and my calves are convulsing too. Meanwhile, my heart is fluttering and I feel like it is very hard for me to focus and I feel things crawling under my skin in my brain.  The muscle convulsions are happening everywhere.

                                                Pain and soreness in vaccination arm was immediate for the rest of the day. Started feeling achey and feverish at the end of the day towards nighttime and bedtime. Took a Tylenol before going to bed. Woke up at 6:00a.m. feeling achey and feverish again, more severe this time. Attempted to walk to get another Tylenol and take my temperature, vision blurred and was extremely cold, immediate nausea, felt like I was going to pass out. Shaking and chills. After drinking Gatorade, ginger ale and water and eating peanut butter toast, nausea settled. After a bit, experienced severe stomach cramps. Drank more ginger ale and Gatorade and took a Tylenol to relieve pain. After 30-45 minutes, pain relieved and I was able to go back to bed. Rest of the day experienced pounding headache and feverish and achey body. Experienced fever highest at 99.8 during the day. After 24 hours passed, feel 100% better and all symptoms and side effects relieved. Only thing sustaining is a little bit of pain and soreness in the arm.

There were no apparent mouth ulcers when she showed me on Friday.

                                                Patient came in for her first dose of Moderna vaccine today.   I was called by MA to see Patient as Patient was having symptom(s) 15 minutes after the vaccine was given.     I saw Patient at 0935.  Patient stated that she feels pressure in her anterior throat, that it was hard for her to swallow saliva, and that her tongue felt big.     I performed physical examination: Cardiovascular:  RRR S1 S2 Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to auscultation Mouth/Throat:  Posterior pharynx doesn&#39;t look swollen, tongue doesn&#39;t look swollen  MA and myself continued to monitor Patient.     I asked Patient to call her mother who Patient stated was waiting downstairs.     I asked MA to obtain vitals: BP:  128/79 HR:  102 bpm   I explained to Patient and mother that I think Patient should be given the Epi-pen in order to prevent any of the symptom(s) from worsening.   Patient and mother agreed to have the Epi-pen administered.     At 0950, Patient stated that her tongue doesn&#39;t feel big anymore, but that she still feels pressure in her anterior throat.  Patient asked for water, she was given a water bottle by MA.  After drinking water, Patient stated it was hard to swallow the water.     At 0955, I administered the Epi-pen in Patient&#39;s right thigh.  Patient felt okay with the administration of the Epi-pen.   I asked  MA to observe Patient for 15 minutes, Mom was in the room with the Patient as well.   At 1015, I went in to see Patient, and per MA and Patient, Patient was feeling much better.  Patient stated that her symptom(s) had resolved, she was not feeling pressure in her anterior throat any longer, she was able to drink water normally, and she didn&#39;t feel that her tongue felt big any longer.     I performed repeat physical examination: Cardiovascular:  RRR S1 S2 Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to auscultation Mouth/Throat:  Posterior pharynx didn&#39;t look swollen, tongue didn&#39;t look swollen   I asked  MA to obtain repeat vitals: BP:  116/73 HR 94 bpm   I have advised Patient to talk to her PCP about whether she should get the second dose of Moderna, or perhaps get another vaccine such as Pfizer in place of the second dose of Moderna.     I have let Patient know that I will CC her chart to her PCP and will try to get a Telemedicine visit with the doctor for Patient during the next week.     I have let Patient know that I will e-prescribe Epi-pen for her.     I have advised Patient and Mom that if symptom(s) worsen or if new symptom(s) start (such as chest pain, SOB, hives, throat/mouth/face/tongue swelling or any other concerning symptoms) to take Patient to the ED.    Mom and Patient understood and agreed.

                                                The 12:20 pm appointment today (4/20/21) had an adverse reaction to the IMZ. Patient was done receiving the vaccine at about 12:30 pm and I stated she would have to wait until 12:45 pm. Around 12:38 pm I noticed she looked a little pale and went to her side to check on her. The patient stated she was feeling light-headed, dizzy, nauseous, and had trouble with her vision. I had the patient lay down and elevate her feet. The technician also grabbed an ice pack to place behind her neck. Asked if she would like water. The patient then stated she was having trouble breathing/short of breath and her ears were ringing. Once the patient stated issues with breathing 911 was called. A code white had been called and management was in the pharmacy. The 911 operator continued to ask questions about the patient&#39;s status and stated to not give any water or medications. I continued to assess the patient&#39;s symptoms. Her vision improved; however, she continued to feel light-headed, nauseous, and having trouble breathing. A member of EMS was in the store and came over to assess the patient. He had the patient sit up but she continued to have the same symptoms. He assessed her IMZ site. She was not feeling itchy and had not developed any hives. The ambulance arrived. EMS evaluated the patient and then took her out of the store on the stretcher.

She reports she had pain in her teeth and her chest felt tight. She just didn&#39;t feel well. Closer to incident student felt dizzy, like she was &#34;going to pass out&#34;.  States she turned to someone to tell that person she was not feeling well &#34;but I couldn&#39;t talk; the words would not come out&#34;. She felt herself sway and then knew she fell to the floor. She felt like she was lying still for a bit but she could hear people around her and she heard someone say &#34;somebody start timing this&#34; (as if they knew it was a seizure).

Tried a variety of flavored things: strawberry starburst, milk, mint, sour cream, yogurt. Found in all of these things the base tastes were much more prominent: the yogurt was very interesting because it was surprisingly sour (the yogurt was not expired, only opened with the last few days). Smell was still functional, however.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

                                                I developed an initial fever of 101.2° and was completely bed bound, then that same initial day I began to develop extremely painful and unexplainable mouth sores and lesions. Some developed on my cheeks, some developed on my tongue and they were so painful that I could not eat, drink water, or even talk. I continued to spike fevers for an entire week without being able to control it. The pain was so unbearable and nothing was helping the pain go away, I am still unable to eat solid foods although I no longer have fevers. My throat also really hurt and my neck lymph nodes felt sore to the touch. The lesions in my mouth are beginning to heal but I am still bed bound and am trying to recover. Only thing I can bring myself to eat is chicken broth. I saw multiple doctors, not one of them was able to figure out the source of these awful lesions. They put me on acyclovir and cefuroximeacetil as an antibiotic.

In the morning at around 8 am I noticed that I broke out in a severe rash all over my body. It has continues to spread all over.

Fifteen minutes late she returned to the pharmacy says she was dizzy and nauseated. We had her sit in the pharmacy for about 20 minutes at whichn time she said she felt better and was ready to go. We had one of our pharmacists walk her but she became dizzy and nauseated again and had to sit down. At this time she said she was hot and very light headed and her vision was starting to get blurry. A minute or so lefter that she sat up in her chair and stopped breathing and started to fall off. One of our pharmacists caugt her and at point she went into convulsions and started gagging and could not breath. 911 was called at this time and an Epi pen was administered. The convulsions stopped 30 seconds afer the Epi and her breathing eazed. The EmT&#39;s arrived with in 10 minutes and took her to local emergency room. Our pharmacist called the emergency room about a hour later and they said that She wwas doing well.

                                                I got my shot, sat down, and was reading through the information that the clinic provided me. A few minutes after, I noticed my right arm was getting warm, but I thought I was being paranoid (placebo effect). I began to feel nauseated. About another 5 minutes after feeling warm and nauseous, my ears began to ring and my vision went white. I was cold but sweating. I have passed out a handful of times before for various reasons, so I knew what was happening. I tried to signal to a volunteer from my seat that I needed help, but I ended up laying on the ground by my chair before someone came over. Once I laid down, the attention of the volunteers and nurses was on me. Three came over to assist me. They held my legs up,  kept a hand on my wrist for a pulse, and fetched water. I talked myself through the dizziness and ringing in my ears. They put a cold rag on my forehead and had smelling salts on hand. Once I began to feel better, they helped me slowly sit up, and eventually helped me stand up and get into a chair. They kept a close eye on me for the next 30 minutes to make sure I didn?t have any other reactions.

I woke up again and still felt terrible and could not even walk short distances without getting very pale, sweaty,  and my vision having spots. I feel chills, a headache, and have been lying down all day. I am most concerned about passing out and becoming unconscious.  I called the Wellness Center and they said to just lie down and stay hydrated

She came to the pharmacy and sat on the floor and when asked she explained what happened. She was told to lay down with feet elevated and she felt a bit better. She asked for water and she felt better. She laid down for 15 minutes and said she could leave but we asked her to stay seated and see how she feels and then after another 15 minutes she said she is fine and left and after an hour called to let us know she is feeling fine.

                                                A few minutes after getting the vaccine she started getting light-headed, nauseous, sweats, and blurred vision prior to getting up and informing the pharmacy staff. Pharmacist gave water. She had turned a yellow color. Mother gave liquid Benadryl - adult dose. Epi was offered - but not use.  Decided to see if Benadryl got her back to normal. After the sweat she got chilled. Waited at the pharmacy for about an hour as her color came back to normal.  Had pharmacists take her blood pressure prior to leaving. It was 106/70. Which would be close to her normal range.  Pharmacist initially had trouble getting pulse and blood pressure but was also using the same arm the vaccination was put into. Pharmacist got that blood pressure off the alternate arm. She went to lunch with Mother afterwards. Mother stayed with her until around 4:00 p.m. Shot was around 12:30 p.m. She went to sleep when she got back to her dorm and missed evening class. She has not noted any other side effects other than the tiredness, but she is a college student that&#39;s known to have low iron, was on her period, that just went through a trauma event that probably would have jumped her adrenaline, and she was giving some liquid Benadryl. I&#39;m sure any one of those could keep the fatigue.  There was a call put into the doctor but she&#39;s procrastinating on getting back to them. No rash or difficulty breathing was noticed.

I was overcome with chills, a fever, and a deep, throbbing ache in my lower back that continues to persist. I had to call off of work and even though I felt like I was freezing, I was sweating profusely.

She was seated in the Observation area and raised her arm indicating she needed help. The RN responded immediately. I was summoned over and was able to move patient to a table in the back of the room. She was complaining of &#34;Stars: in her vision and not feeling well. First set of vitals were completed at 14:27 BP 116/91, P 100, O2 Sat 97%. Patient is a student. She ate a granola (Nature Made fruit and nut) bar that she has in her pocket. She remained with us for just over an hour , during which time she complained of a fast heart rate, mild nausea and &#34;stars&#34; at the edges of her vision. During the hour she drank over 16 oz of apple juice. She called parents friends to come pick her up and deliver her to her dorm on campus. Last vitals taken at 15:35 110/78 P 104, O2 Sat 99%

                                                After receiving my second dose, I started to develop mouth ulcers covering the entire inside of my mouth. Throughout the weekend, they continued to develop. I went to the ER to receive pain medication, as the ulcers were so bad that I could not talk or eat. The following morning, I passed out going to pick up my medication at CVS, where I was taken back to the hospital in an ambulance and had a 103 degree fever. I was given IV fluids and was sent on my way. I was on strict bedrest for 4 days, until on Thursday 04/22/2021, I was readmitted to the ER due to worsening of the sores and lack of nutrition. For 3 days since then, I have been on IV fluids, pain medication, and taking a steroid solution to help the ulcers in my mouth lessen. The doctors here believe that it is an extremely strong reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine second dose.

                                                About roughly two weeks after receiving this vaccine I had a migraine. I had never had a migraine before so I went to urgent care, where they told me it would probably go away in a couple of days. It didn&#39;t, and I was having a whole horde of visual symptoms (floaters, flashing lights, photophobia, visual aura) so I went to Mass Eye and Ear ER about a week later. They did an examination of my eyes and told me it was all okay, and most likely due to a migraine. I assumed it would go away once more, but never did, with the symptoms continuing to become more frequent/severe. While the actual migraine part (head hurting to specify) would come and go, my visual symptoms never subsided. And despite MEE saying my vision was actually 20/15, so I could still objectively see fine, it was just not normal. I started to have vertigo, and more visual auras (a plain green line in my vision for a couple of minutes), and with these symptoms going on for about two weeks at this point, I went to an urgent care appointment at MGH, through my doctor. They administered some migraine medication (sumatriptan and zofran), but my visual symptoms did not improve. I was then sent to MGH er. They tested me for a whole myriad of things, as well as administering an MRI/MRA of the brain, and MRI of the spine, as well as performing a spinal tap, none of which yielded any significant findings. Many of my visual symptoms still persist, and the headache part, as well as vertigo, comes and goes. It has been almost a month since receiving the first dose and I am waiting to see if symptoms improve with the second. While it is obviously unclear as to whether this happened due to the vaccine or due to a third unknown factor, considering these symptoms developed roughly around the time you allegedly start to gain a significant immunity to COVID, and that no medical professionals have been able to find a clear reason for them, I feel as though it is possible and likely. (Also, I had previously had COVID, testing positive Jan 18th 2021, if that&#39;s of any relevance).

                                                Pt said that in the past she has fainted in the past with other vaccines. Pt was also currently fasting which probably contributed to the episode. Patient was given vaccine and felt fine immediately afterwards, she sat in our immunization room for a few minutes before standing. She then walked to our &#34;waiting area&#34; and sat down. About 5 minutes after, she said she felt dizzy and asked for water. We asked her to sit and would bring her water. Pharmacist (reporter for VAERS) brought water out to her and she fainted in her presence. Pharmacist kept patient upright to prevent her from sliding to the floor. Patient said she has lost vision (was just a bright light). By this point the paramedics have already been called. Patient was feeling much better by the time paramedics came, but they still wanted to check her out to make sure everything was ok. Patient had a long drive back home so not sure what the outcome was.

She temporarily lost vision in both eyes as well as her hearing. She became cold to the touch, red, and clammy. Patient reported feeling like she was feeling like she was blacking out. We had given her water, wiped her off with towels, and fanned her. 911 was called at this point and her blood pressure was checked which showed 122/91mmHg. Management came over to the pharmacy and was helping fan her as well. The fire dept and EMTs showed up soon after and took over. Patient?s hearing and vision were restored and started feeling back to normal. Patient then declined further medical intervention from EMT?s and went home.

Within 10 minutes, my face had swollen up, my eyes were swollen and red, and my hands, feet and chest had hives.   Paramedics were called and arrived 5 minutes later. At this time I was barely able to walk, was still vomiting and having diarrhea, and was shaking. They put me in the ambulance and took me to a 24hr emergency clinic.   In the ambulance, I was given saline, epinephrine, Benadryl and nausea meds. I stayed under observation until 3 am. I was released to go home at that time. Since then I have only experienced weakness and nausea.

Asked if it was done without realizing vaccine was complete. Pt was sturdy upon standing and said she felt well. She made it to the chair in the designated area in front of the pharmacy. Approximately 3-5 minutes later patient raised her arm to get the attention of the staff. Said she felt funny. Vaccinating pharmacist went out to determine what was wrong. Patient said she felt faint and dizzy as well as felt nauseous. Patient spit up clear saliva inbetween dry heaving. We were able to give her paper towels and some water after her episode of spitting up. Approximately 5 to 7 minutes later she said she felt better but still had some faintness and a tingling sensation in her arms and fingers. Had patient stay for 20 minutes after she said she was feeling better. No more shaking, nausea, or faintness. She felt her normal self after the 20 minutes and her mother was with her to drive her home. Explained to patient that VAERS report would be submitted.

                                                About 6-7 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started to develop hives around my body, including on feet, stomach, ears, face, back, and legs. I had fever and chills, muscle aches, joint pain,  headaches,  and nausea later that night as well. The next morning, my left eye was swollen, left side of tongue completely swollen, lips swollen, and left side of throat closed (anaphylaxis). I took prednisone, Benadryl, and Tylenol to relieve the symptoms, and the swelling around my left eye, tongue, throat, and lips went away. Throughout the day, more hives have developed around my body and face, including my right eye.  I am continuing to take Benadryl and Tylenol and finish doses of prednisone. The fever and chills, muscles aches, joint pains, hives, headache, and nausea are still present.

                                                Patient received the vaccine and asked to sit down to wait for 15 minute observation period.  Pharmacy staff heard the patient fall and hit the ground. Pharmacist, reached patient first followed by pharmacist.  Patient was visualized on the ground with eyes open. Visualized the patient&#39;s neck bent backwards and muscles rigid including neck and arms.  Went to get cold compress while stayed with the patient.  At the same time, 911 was contacted by the pharmacy staff and a fire fighter in the pharmacy area was brought over to assist. Assisted the patient to a sitting position and noticed her pupils to be dilated. Returned with cold compress for neck and forehead. Went to get cold water while comforted the patient.  Fire fighters present took the patient&#39;s vitals and blood sugar and all was within normal limits.  Further questions with the patient found that she had not eaten breakfast or lunch that day.  She also indicated that she had passed out before at a concert while dehydrated in the past.  She had not passed out or reacted to any previous injections or vaccines.

Not sure if this is relevant, but my body responded strongly in the day or so after the 2nd vaccine with shivers, headaches, and fevers.

That passed and I started getting really dizzy and was unable to hear or see anything. I pulled over and my throat started to close up and I was having a hard time breathing. It passed in about 2 minutes and an hour later I felt fine but my brain felt tingly like I was on the verge of passing out but no other side effects.  My brain still feels tingly as well.

After a few minutes, the patient&#39;s mother recognized that she was becoming very pale. Patient had difficulty communicating, her eyes were moving, and she stated that she could not hear. I picked the patient up to lay her on the ground and she lost control of her body. Her mother and I laid her on the ground and held her legs up. After 15-20 seconds, she regained consciousness. I gave the patient a bottle of water. She waited for about 15 minutes before leaving and stated that she was feeling fine and would return for her second dose.

I called my aunt that?s a doctor she told me to take Benadryl which helped. The swelling on my lips lasted until April 27th, and only one side swelled up . 2nd dose of Moderna: I had a fever, chills, swollen lips, itchy tongue, my lips also turned blue. This time the opposite sides of my lip swelled up and it?s extremely painful when rubbed against. I can breathe so I?m not worried.  Allergy medicine seems to help with the swelling and itchiness. My nose is stuffy and i have a lot of abdominal cramping.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I became extremely dizzy, nauseous, my lips went numb, shortness of breath, weakness, slow reaction times, the inability to operate at my normal speed in thought and action, and I became very lethargic.  I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

                                                Pt received COVID-19 vaccine at 9:57am. Pt went to waiting area in front of pharmacy and sat down. Pt was on her phone when she said she felt like she started dreaming.  Her friend said her eyes rolled back and she threw her phone on the floor at 10:02am.  When I got to the patient a customer (nurse) was already assisting the patient. EMS and Code White were called at 10:03am. Pt was awake and aware of what was going on. She said she had no history or fainting or seizures. She did say that she normally had a lower blood pressure. Pt was sitting up but laid back down at 10:05am saying that she was having vision issues and feeling dizzy.  BP was 112/70 and HR 75 at 10:10am. EMS arrived at 10:12am and took over.  BP was still low at that time.  Pt denied going to the hospital and EMS left at 10:20am.  Pt stayed with friends until 10:40am. Pt left the store with 3 friends who had also received vaccine.

                                                Following the vaccine, I was perfectly fine and was able to go about my day as normal. However, while doing dishes at 11:30 at night (about 10 hours after I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine) exhaustion and dizziness suddenly hit me, and my vaccine went black and my ears started ringing. I managed to lie down but I fainted and blacked out for a minute. After I regained consciousness, I had these muscle contractions/shivers (although I took my temperature and had no fever). I felt really exhausted, and went to sleep after that. However, other than that I had no other vaccine side effects. I was told by my doctor to report this though since they had not heard of anyone else fainting, and I have no history of fainting (other than once following blood donation). I also was not thinking about anything remotely related to the vaccine at the time of fainting, and I had no qualms with being vaccinated so I highly doubt it was psychological, especially considering I have no history of fainting, and I had an injectable medication so I have no issues with injections.

Slowly the rash spread to entire face including the neck region. At 72 hours post vaccination she noted swelling and redness around the lips with tightness in chest prompting here to seek help. Noted to have generalized swelling and erythema to face along with the periorbital area and eye lids on exam [ after Benadryl]- no respiratory distress.  Reaction thought to possibly be an acute worsening of her underlying eczema but could not rule out vaccine reaction.  Treated with Benadryl, Zyrtec and Prednisone

RN  assessed patient and took vitals. Patient was alert and oriented and able to speak in full sentences,  denied SOB, chest pain and was breathing comfortably.  BP was 80/40 HR 50&#39;s, RR 18. The PA at the clinic where the clinic was being held assessed patient and assessed lung sounds which were clear and the patient then reported feeling &#34;a lot better&#34;.  Color returned to her lips and face.  Patient was asked to stay on-site for continued observation before leaving. Approximately 10 minutes later patient asked to use the bathroom in our clinic.  She was advised she could go as long as her Mom was allowed to go in with her in case she experienced dizziness or needed help.   After 5-10 minutes the patient was still in the bathroom. RN who worked inside clinic checked on patient who reported diarrhea more dizziness and weakness.

At this time the patient was speaking in full sentences able to walk and and did not report any breathing problems.  After helping patient back to her vehicle RN called ER to give report to the charge nurse.

Once I got home I sat down and started to get very anxious and my chest felt heavy and my tongue and throat started to swell. I say and tried to relax and was going to call 911 if it got worse. They swelling maintained so I took one benadryl, followed by another one 30 minutes later. When I woke up the swelling was still there but had gotten better. I took another benadryl that night. The swelling continued to go down over the next couple of days. After about 5 days I felt back to normal.

                                                The day of getting my vaccine, I had received the shot at 1:30pm on 4/30. I had no symptoms besides a sore arm at the injection site. I woke up at 4:00am on 5/1 with a fever of 99.9F and chills. I decided to take a hot shower because I couldn?t get warm. At the end of my shower I suddenly got a ?sickly? feeling in my chest, similar to symptoms of a chest cold. My vision started going black, almost like when you stand up too quickly. I experienced a sudden throbbing headache out of nowhere. My ears were ringing with partial hearing loss, and I started getting very nauseous. I stumbled out of the shower and immediately vomited.

                                                Approximately ten hours after injection, woke up with constant chills, fever of 100.1, body aches, stuffed nose (had to breathe out of mouth), and headache. Acetaminophen helped slightly. For the next 12 hours fever stayed between 101 and 102 despite continuing to take acetaminophen, and headache also didn&#39;t improve. At 6:15 pm that day (~29 hours post-shot) fever was 103.2, headache was very strong (with light sensitivity). Since acetaminophen hadn&#39;t been helping, switched to ibuprofen. About an hour later, the fever finally began to go down and was gone by 10 pm that night. The next day, no fever and minimal headache, but was very weak and lightheaded. At about 51 hours after the shot, symptoms were all gone.

O2 99%, HR 82, and BP 140/82. Pt told to stay for further monitoring. Pt then c/o &#34; throat tightening&#34; at 1726 and 0.3mg epi pen given in RT at 1727 after pt was laid supine with legs elevated. Vitals taken again at 1732: BP 170/100, O2 99%, and HR 105. Pt stated her throat felt &#34;much better&#34;. EMS was called at 1727 when Epi was administered. Pt called her mother to notify her of situation. Pt also called father and he did not want pt assessed by EMS or taken to hospital in ambulance. When EMS arrived, father was not present and pt did not refuse treatment, so they did perform an assessment. After that, pt refused tx and continued to feel &#34;well&#34; with no other complaints other than &#34;shakiness&#34;, which is a common side-effect of epinephrine. EMS left and pt&#39;s father arrived. Pt was able to sit and stand on her own. Before she left, she complained of &#34;tightening&#34; and &#34;tingling&#34; again in her throat. Told her she should receive another epipen. Pt&#39;s father said he had one in the car and that he would give it to her and drive her to the hospital.  Pt nodded in understanding. Pt vitals taken at 1750, BP 162/84, HR 113, O2 99%.

We gave the patient some bottled water and ice pack and she started to feel better, but ultimately her mother wanted me to call EMS. Ems instructed no food or drink until they got there.  The EMS took her blood pressure which was in the 80s/50s.  The patient said she was feeling better but was fearful of another dizzy spell and wanted to go with EMS out of an abundance of caution.  From the time she received the vaccine to the time she left with EMS it was no more than 30 minutes.

                                                Patient received vaccine and said it was painless. She was accompanied by her mother, shortly in to her 15 minute waiting period her mother approached and said the patient felt light headed. I asked patient to remove her mask and assessed for any swelling of the lips or the face. Patient stated she did not have any issues breathing but felt very faint. Her eyes were very dilated, and she wanted to lay down. So we assisted patient to the floor, called Code White and 911. I stayed with patient as she lay down, she began to recover, but still looked very pale. I continually assessed patient for anaphylaxis, but patient reported no pain in injection site or issues breathing. Paramedics arrived and assessed patient,  BP was normal, blood sugar was in the low normal range, paramedics determined that issue was not related to vaccine, but that she was dehydrated and had not eaten, which exacerbated the light headedness.

Next day I had chills, nausea, headache, sore throat, and  shakes. Started the afternoon of the next day.  My arm has been red and itchy since the day, but it is increasing becoming warmed, bigger, and itchier every day since.

I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine at 3:50pm on 01/25/2021. Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

She also said she has been having chills and she is short of breath &#34;after walking across the room&#34;.  I didn&#39;t notice any SOB while speaking on the phone.  We talked quite a bit and I kept asking her what else her symptoms she was having and she didn&#39;t have anything additional to say.  But when I asked if her throat and lips was tingling she stated yes it feels like her throat is closing.  The things I specifically asked about she stated &#34;yes&#34; that was happening to her.  She denied having any Benadryl at home.  I told her to go to urgent care immediately and to call me back once she is seen,

Took her pulse which was steady and regular, breathing on own without difficulty. 911 was called immediately. After about 2-3 minutes patient was becoming more responsive .Aftera few more minutes we placed patient on the chair, at which time the paramedics arrived. Patient has had past experiences of fainting due to body piercings or had problems as a child when she was immunized that was later revealed to me by her father.

                                                Minutes after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, patient complained of difficulty breathing.  I asked if she was wheezing and she said no.  A doctor in the clinic came over and even though it wasn&#39;t time for patient and her sister to leave (based on 15-minutes after receiving the vaccine) he initially suggested that they might be fine to go, but after patient told him of her symptoms and at my urging he decided to have her stay a little longer.   I think it was at this time that he had someone check her pulse.  I don&#39;t know what the pulse reading was.  He stepped away and shortly afterwards patient started complaining that her throat felt strange and was making it hard to breathe.  The doctor immediately came back over, found patient was having difficulty breathing and holding herself upright in the chair.  I held her by the shoulders to keep her from falling while the doctor also steadied her and asked a worker in the room for an epi-pen.  The worker didn&#39;t seem to react much to the request so he told her louder that he needed an epi-pen.  She started searching her area and the doctor started yelling across the room to others that he needed an epi-pen.  It seemed like others initially took the demand less urgently than they should, but eventually someone came with an epi-pen.  By this time I don&#39;t think patient was very conscious, if at all.  Sometime during this time the doctor also instructed someone to call 911.  The doctor tried using the epi-pen but at first he had some kind of cap on it that prevented it from working.  He removed the cap and not finding an easy way to have a sterilized injection site he injected the epi-pen through patient&#39;s jeans.  Soon afterwards a cot was brought out and workers had me step aside as they took patient and put her on the cot.  Patient seemed to gradually become more aware of her surroundings and it wasn&#39;t long before she appeared to me to be fully conscious once again.  They checked her blood pressure and pulse and maybe did other tests during this time.  Eventually the ambulance arrived and patient was very clear with everyone that she did not want to incur the expenses of riding in the ambulance and I offered to bring her wherever they suggested that she should go.  They watched and evaluated her for a while and eventually had her sign the form declining the ambulance transportation.  They suggested that she make an appointment with her doctor but did not suggest that we take patient to an emergency room.  We departed and patient did not afterward  seem to experience any symptoms from the vaccine other than some of the general feelings of being sick, soreness at the injection site, etc. that others report with the Moderna vaccine.

I got it checked out by a covid reaction physician who said it was a mild allergic reaction. The second dose my left eye swelled shut and both lips swelled up about 24 hours after administration. My throat started to close and I couldn?t breathe. I ended up having to go to the emergency room where they were able to control the allergic reaction. They said it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine and have recommended not getting any more covid vaccines in the future if there were more produced.

Pt  was able to whisper and acknowledge me.  She was oriented to person and place.  Her pupils were constricted, but was lying in the sunshine.  EMS had already called for ambulance.  I talked with Pt to obtain any medications, history and allergies - to which she denied all.  She then began to tremor with her eyes rolling into her head, unresponsive during this episode.  After about 20 seconds, she focused on me and was able to respond to some direction.  By that time ambulance was present. She was lifted by 6 people and placed onto stretcher.

                                                Immediately after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine the patient began to feel nauseous, hot and her arm was hurting. I kept her in the immunization booth and monitored her. Within a minute of her initial feeling she stated that she was having trouble seeing and was &#34;going to black out&#34;. She immediately lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back, and her head went limp and fell back. She then began a twitching movement, made a snorting noise and then all of her limbs went rigid and extended straight out. At the first sign of her reaction we paged management and then as soon as she had loss of consciousness we contacted 911. She regained consciousness and was able to start answering my questions within 30 seconds to 1 minute. We did get the patient water and began to fan her to help cool her off. She was able to tell me who she was, where she was and why she was here. We also gave her some chips and had her eat slowly and drink small sips. She had stated that she was very nervous at the beginning of our pre immunization questions. She told us after that she had not eaten a lot before coming for the shot, but did eat more than normal because she knew she was coming in. She contacted her parents to inform them of the situation. She was able to recount everything prior to her loss of consciousness. When EMS arrived she was able to answer their questions. They took her vitals and all were in normal range, BP=119/66, pulse=98. They asked her to stand and she was able to stand and maintain balance on her own, but stated her legs felt a little &#34;shaky&#34;. She refused transport to the hospital by EMS, but did call her roommate to come pick her up. I had her wait in the COVID waiting area until her roommate arrived. I called her around 4pm (same day) to check on her and she said she is feeling much better. Her mom (a nurse) also came down to stay with her and was with her when I called.

Three days after I woke up and my right eye and cheek were super puffy and I had a rash on my face that was red and blotchy and itchy. It is now four days later and hives and face rash still persist but due to medications don&#39;t seem to be getting worse.

I woke up this morning with an extremely sore throat.

Within 3 to 5 minutes, patient came to the pharmacy counter complaint that her toungue feel heavy, hard to talk and her throat feeling swollen.  She was able to breath but worried.  She had no sign of rash or itching.  Patient was fully alert and awared.  She said she had the same issue when she had nuts when she was younger and did not happened again since then .  On Patient&#39;s Var form she did not indicate that she has any history of allergic reaction.  Pharmacist gave her Epinephrine 0.3mg injection to her thigh and within 5 to 10 seconds she felt release from throat swollen and toungue heavy.  Pharmacist took her BP 117/74 and Pulse 85 (within normal range) and told patient that we are going to call paramedic to check on her and she agreed.   Pharmacist told shift lead who was happened right next to the vaccine room to call emergency number.  Paramedic arrived, took her vitals and said that she needs to go to the hospital for observation.  She refused at first but then agreed when the paramedic told her she need to stay in the pharmacy for 1 hour for observation if she does not want to go to the hospital for observation.  Patient is able to walk out with the paramedic to the hospital.

I took allergy pills but it didn&#39;t do anything. The following day, Sunday, I had a very bad headache on the left side of my head. I had that headache for three days. That headache was over and then by that time I had lost my sense of smell for five to six days. I would get nauseous when I would eat - had a mild cough; no fever and body aches. I had  COVID test taken. They told me to take Tylenol  if I had a fever but I didn&#39;t have one; but I took: Dayquil; Nyquil and Theraflu and those things helped. (Telemed Dr. visit - was what I had.)

Some heaviness in her chest  which progressed over next 10 minutes to feeling difficulty breathing - &#34;like a rock on her chest&#34; . At 09:04 AM She used her Albuterol asthma inhaler to see if it would help her breathing. No improvement in breathing, then complained at 0911 of some vision changes, felt like she was having to concentrate to breath - like breathing through a straw and at this time I started to hear her audibly wheezing - Squad was called. When they arrived around 9:18 AM she was having heaviness, closed her eyes - complaining of a little bit light headed, still having difficulty breathing.  She left with squad at 9:24 AM

I started to get warm and felt like I was about to vomit so I washed my face with cool water. I went to sit down and my vision started to blur and my vision started to close in with darkness and I passed out. When I gained consciousness again, I was still extremely dizzy and light-headed and my vision was still not focused. I passed out two more times. When I gained consciousness the final time, I was extremely sweaty and shaky. I called 911 and they sent paramedics to my house. I drank some water and stayed in the floor until they arrived. They took me by ambulance to the hospital to run several tests and everything looked normal.

                                                Patient developed visual symptoms the week following administration of the COVID vaccine. Symptoms included blurry vision and double vision. Patient did not seek care. Patient received 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine on 5/12 and had escalation in symptoms after that dose. Patient finally saw her PCP on 5/18 who immediately sent her to optometry where she was noted to have papilledema. She was sent to the ED where an MRI/MRV confirmed increased intercranial pressure without space occupying lesion. LP showed elevated opening pressure of 45/ Patient started on Diamox for presumed IIH.

                                                My sense of taste and smell has become distorted. I never tested positive for COVID-19 or had any symptoms of the virus at all, which is what makes this change in taste and smell so weird. I did not lose my sense of taste or smell, but there are many foods and smells that now either smell sickly sweet or too earthy. I hoped that this issue would resolve after getting the second dose of the vaccine, but two weeks after my second dose, I am still dealing with this side effect. It has been several weeks now and my sense of taste and smell are sometimes so distorted that it is nauseating.

                                                I took the vaccine on April 6th around 8:40 PM, and the next day around 2:30 AM I noticed multiple pumps on my chest area and the back part of my thighs, and they were quite itchy. On April 8th, I woke up with my lips completely swollen, very tingly, and feeling warm - I, unfortunately, had a college test on that exact day and could not go to the hospital straight away. They told me to go get it checked and go to the hospital in case I have trouble breathing. My lips ended up going back to normal eventually. I went to three different doctors after a couple of days because I kept getting sick and also to explain the situation and ask if I could even take the second dose of the vaccine since it was approaching. All three doctors told me not to because my body could go into anaphylactic shock, so I did not take it.

She was barely responsive and talking very faintly- NO difficulty breathing or any symptoms of allergic reaction. Had a staff member call 911. After a few minutes she threw up and then she was able to communicate a little more than earlier. She mentioned that she had a similar reaction to another vaccination in the past and her mother said that she (the pt) was a little scared and worried before coming in to get the shot. The paramedics arrived soon after, briefed them the sequence of events. She was doing well by then. F/u with a call to patient at around 4pm-all ok she said.

                                                During her 15 minute, post vaccination wait, the left side of her bottom lip began to swell. Then the swelling progressed to the right side of her bottom lip. She did not tell anyone at the clinic about this. Within the hour, she had also developed swelling under her tongue, around frenulum. Also had swelling under her top lip, where lip attaches to gum. Also had metallic taste in her mouth and throat was itchy.  These symptoms are the same exact symptoms she gets when she has an allergic reaction to cold substances that she eats/drinks (she has cold urticaria for which she carries an Epipen).  She notified me at approximately 2pm. She said lip swelling had decreased some by that time but other symptoms still present. I had her take 50mg of benadryl. That helped reduce symptoms further but they were still present. At urgent care, she was given decadron IM, told to use benadryl 50mg every 6 hours x 24 hours, and given RX for prednisone 50mg x 5 days. She already takes zyrtec daily.  Within an hour of the decadron injection, symptoms improved further. As of 1300 on June 10, symptoms are resolved.

                                                I recieved the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/5/21 and did not experience any adverse reactions in the days following. Then, on 1/13/21 (8 days post vaccine) I noticed hives covering most of my body. My face was tingling and my lips were swollen. I took an antihistamine that evening hoping it would go away. The day after 1/14/21 I woke up with the hives all over my body, especially on my face. They were very severe and itchy. I went to my dermatologist and they recommended a steroid cream and oral antihistamine to help reduce the itching. It is now 1/15/20, and the hives are still covering most of my body with severe hives on my face.

Left after sitting for 20 minutes because I thought the &#34;anxiety&#34; would resolve best at home. Arrived home at 10:25 AM. My lips started itching, and then swelled along with my tongue. My throat felt tight and I tried to take an oral Benadryl. It got stuck in my throat and I was unable to swallow the pill. It was also difficult to swallow water. I arrived at the ED by 10:40 AM, where I was treated with IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol. I remained swollen all over, especially in my fingers, for the next 4 days. I gained 12 pounds, either from the reaction or the steroids. My airway did not fully close.

Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 1000 which lowered temp and reduced other symptoms for approximately two hours. Symptoms returned at 1200 with temp reaching 100.2 F along with chills, headache, and body aches that were more intense in the shoulder/neck area. Used a heating pad along my back, shoulders, and neck which helped with the body aches. Slept from 1500 to 1800 and woke up with an intense frontal headache with pain shooting through my eyes as well. Temp was 100.7 F. Took 400 mg ibuprofen which made the symptoms more bearable. Tried to stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Also had two servings of soup. Symptoms seemed to lessen by 2200. The only symptoms lingering today, 2/4, are a slight headache, fatigue, and mental fog. Otherwise, condition has improved tremendously.

Paramedic onsite immediately listened to lungs and heard diffuse wheezing bilaterally. Within 1m minute patient felt throat tickling and then tightening and breathing was more difficult. Paramedic gave  patient EpiPen with resolution of symptoms in less than 1-2 minutes. Ambulance called and arrived very quickly. Patient was transported to  hospital. As way to hospital patient felt breathing getting worse again and was given solumedrol and benadryl IV and a second EpiPen. Don&#39;t yet know what happened beyond this.

                                                I got my first dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine on Wednesday February 3rd. I was completely fine, definitely experienced a sore arm for 2-3 days. Noticed my injection site was pretty low to where you would normally put an IM injection. Also noticed, swelling locally around the injection site every day after getting the COVID vaccine. The j je tino site felt warm to the touch and was still swollen. Around Friday night, I started to get really itchy. Didn?t think much of it. Until I took a look on Saturday afternoon. My top half of my back, my neck and left ear where covered in small weird hives/bumps and was red and itchy. I took some Benadryl, and hoped it went away. It didn?t. Sunday morning my left ear was getting even more swollen, and this time the rash wasn?t all on my top back, but instead, traveled down my spine. This is when I decided to head to the ER since no urgent care was open, and they ruled it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave me a steroid and Benadryl injection IM, and am reporting this the morning after. I currently haven?t felt any itching or have noticed much swelling/redness. I think it?s also important to note that I?ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything, this my first ever, that I can recall.

I developed hives on my forehead, cheeks, neck, chest, and arms. The fingers on both my hands and my lips were tingling.  Treatment: I was rushed to the ER and given an IV steroid, IV fluids (2 bags), and IV benadryl.   Outcome: All the reactions went away within 4 hours and I was discharged from the ER. I was advised to take benadryl for 48 hours afterwards as needed and given a 5 day course of prednisone; 2 tablets taken daily.

Symptoms would come and go throughout day, but were worse in the mornings. Wednesday (2/10) - Present (2/13) - same symptoms as Tuesday (2/9). Symptoms worse in the mornings and after physical exertion (going to school, walking stairs), and at night as well. Symptoms are not severe, but I am concerned that they have lasted a full week. I have been taking Day-Quil severe every 4 hours. I was also on my period, which just ended yesterday (2/12). I believe my period started the day of the vaccine.  I plan on going to a doctor&#39;s office, but have been too tired to move from my apartment.

The first dose wasn?t too bad but this time I was vomiting so violently that there was a profuse amount of blood coming out for 3 hours. I?ve never experienced a migraine but I?ve had an extremely painful and debilitating migraine since 4am. Around 10am I was dry heaving and vomiting up bile. I have excruciating back pain since 10pm last night, horrible full body chills, fever of 102, skin, and light sensitivity.

                                                received her COVID Moderna 1st dose vaccine on 3/15/21 in the late afternoon. After she had her vaccine she sat down in a chair and waited out her 15 minutes. During this time she said her ears were ringing and she felt faint. We switched her chair to one with larger arms to sit. She asked for water, we provided her a bottle of water and she started to breathe heavily. Her mom was with her and also was vaccinated waiting for 15 minutes. During this time her breathing became labored and she was feeling very faint. I called 911 and EMS arrived about 10 minutes later to see how she was doing. At no point did Taylor pass out or lose consciousness. She was cleared by EMS who checked her blood pressure which was normal and she did not have labored breathing after their visit. During the EMS check they asked the last time she ate and that was at 11 am. She declined medical transport to the hospital and was able to walk out of the facility.

She said on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most severe , her lip tingling was a 2. I stayed with her and kept monitoring her and continued to communicate with her. I informed her that she will have to stay for another 15 minutes due to the tingling of her lips. She consented to stay. A few minutes later, she stated that her throat felt as if it was closing. I informed her that due to her symptoms i will have to administer Epipen with her consent. She consented to the use of Epipen Auto injection. I asked the technician to call 911 immediately while I administered Epipen Auto Injection 0.3mg/0.3ml. The EMS team arrived a few minutes after that and took her via ambulance to the hospital. I called her today 4/4/21 and she said she felt much butter and was fine. She said she did not receive any treatment while at the hospital and was discharged on the same day 4/3/21

When I came to, I was disoriented for about 2 minutes and very cold.  -For a week after I fainted I was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up without feeling that I was going to faint.  -The second week after my shot I also felt pressure on my chest for 5 days that has since then gone away.  -Since I fainted 3 hours after my shot  I have experienced constant ringing in both ears that have not stopped for the past 30 days since I got the vaccine. I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

EMS was called to bring patient to the ER; she was treated with Benadryl which immediately improved the globus sensation and significantly improved the rash. She was then dosed with solu-medrol as well. While at the hospital patient described a slight fullness of tongue and scratchiness of throat; the MD immediately treated with epinephrine and symptoms improved.  Patient was discharged in stable condition later the same night.

                                                Received shot at 10:00  Felt strange almost immediately. No specified symptoms just brain fog and difficulty  holding conversations. Noticed my chronic back pain (L5 fracture) was very bad, but didn?t initially connect it to the vaccine.   By 4:00 I was running a fever, fatigue, shivering, sweating, could not eat due to lack of appetite / nausea. Could not think straight.   The night of the 22nd (day I received 2nd dose of vaccine) I had difficulty sleeping, heart palpitations, and extremely strange dreams when I did sleep. The next morning (23rd)  I felt much better, even walked around for a bit, but by noon I was back to having sever symptoms. My fever spiked, my energy was drained, and my back pain was unbearable.   This progressed over the afternoon into unbearable tooth pain along with the back pain and other symptoms. Back pain did not recede with rest as it normally does. Ibuprofen did not seem to mitigate symptoms much.  Brain fog was intense and I could not focus on anything.   Managed to sleep last night and had more vivid dreams. Woke up feelings fine but symptoms seem to be slowly returning.

                                                Administered the first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. No apparent concerns were found when reviewing the PQCF and talking with the patient prior to administering the vaccine. Patient verbally stated she&#39;d never experienced a reaction immediately after receiving a vaccine and specifially referred to receiving flu shots annually. Vaccine was administered at 15:02, and the patient was seated in the designated &#34;Post-vaccine waiting area&#34; located directly in front of the pharmacy windows. At 15:04 patient began to feel nauseated with flacial flushing. CPhT was monitoring the patient. At 15:06, the patient began to exhibit s/s of syncope, including: facial flushing, profuse sweating, nausea, weakness, coldness of extremities, and visual disturbances. At 15:06, the patient&#39;s face/lips began to lose color while stating she was dizzy. Under her own power with aid, the patient was gently transferred from the chair to the floor and placed in the supine position with both feet propped up on the chair. She was given an ice pack and paper towels and remained on the floor for approximately 14 minutes. At 15:21, the patient stated she felt much better and wanted to try to sit up. After monitoring the patient for 34 minutes, she left the pharmacy area under her own power stating she felt much better and still plans on getting the second vaccine. Patient was counseled and questions were answered regarding this reaction.

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

Stood up to take my temperature and almost fainted (had to sit back down on bed, my ears were ringing and vision was grayed out, I may have been unconscious for a second or two). I was sweating and shaking from that, and went to the toilet and threw up a little bit. Dizziness/faintness persisted when standing until around 9 am.

                                                Around 7pm that night I started to have a clenching feeling in my chest. I didnt have any trouble breathing and that feeling lasted through the night. I felt kind of flushed and tried and dizzy. Then the dizziness got a lot worse the next day. I was extremely dizzy to the point where I couldn&#39;t drive for a week. Also I started having ringing in my ears which is still present. Since then I&#39;ve had a number of other symptoms that have sort of come and gone. I&#39;ve noticed they have gotten bad my second half of my menstrual cycle. Iv had muscle spasms and nerve pain. My left leg felt like it was on fire for a while. Otherwise of yet I&#39;ve just felt like I&#39;ve had lower energy than normal and had more headaches.

                                                About 5:45 pm on Saturday, January 2, 2021 my inner left eye began to feel itchy and irritated like there was something in it. I touched my eye and rubbed it for approximately 30 minutes, but it still felt like I had something poking my inner eyelid. I looked in the mirror and saw my inner, upper, left eyelid was swollen and slowly getting worse. I tried applying a warm compress for 10 minutes, but it did not seem to help. I was getting ready for a shower and saw hives on my hips and inner thighs. I felt itchy in other places of my body as well. I saw hives on both of my upper arms, my back, and my neck. I took one 25 mg Benadryl and got in the shower. As I was showering, I felt my left upper lip begin to tingle and swell. I rushed to the ER immediately. I arrived around 7:25 pm. As I was waiting for the ER doctor, I noticed my lip and eye swelling were almost back to normal, but I still had hives and they were spreading. The ER doctor gave me Benedryl and Solumedrol in an IV around 9 pm. I left the ER around 10 pm. I had no more swelling on my eye and lip and my hives were slowly diminishing.

We decided to administer epinephrine instead of waiting for her to continue to get worse.  I administered an epi-pen (0.3mg) about 30 minutes after she took the Benadryl and a nurse from the SNF called 911.  Paramedics arrived and evaluated her.  Her breathing sounded okay via the paramedic&#39;s stethoscope.  Because she was still not reporting feeling &#34;back to normal&#34; and because she had epinephrine administered, she was transported via ambulance to the ER for continued monitoring.

I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

Now on 01/16/2021, I started getting a cough, a sore throat, a  fever, and extremely tired. Then the next day the symptoms got worse and now I had a stuffy nose, inner ear pain, nausea, muscle aches all over my body, dizzyness, and chills. This continued into Sunday and now Monday.

I went to the Emergency Department and got Prednisone, Pepcid, and Benadryl.  The next day, I started to experience tremors, mostly in my right hand.   Two days later, I was so dizzy that the room was spinning and I could hardly stand up. Did not receive treatment for it.

                                                The day of the vaccine about 4 hours later, I started experiencing chest pain. It was not tightness or a heartburn feeling type of chest pain. I have asthma, and it is the type of chest pain I start feeling right before I get bronchitis, almost like breathing in mist and the irritation that comes from having a cough, but I had not had a cough that would have caused this sensation. The next day, I was extremely fatigued, had a headache, chills, started getting a cough, and was sent home early from work. The day after, Friday, I had a fever of 102 and was essentially bedridden. I started using my nebulizer and my dr called me in some prednisone. These symptoms continued through the weekend and began lifting that Sunday. However, on Monday, my lymph node under my ear started swelling on my left side (the same side as the shot), my ear became clogged, my sinuses on my left side had shooting pain every time I inhaled, and although I could breathe through my nostrils, they felt full and had immense pressure. Additionally my headache became worse and I began experiencing intense muscle pain right at the base of my skull on the left side near my occipital lymph node that was radiating into my head and making the headache and sinus pain worse. Now, 11 days after my first dose of the vaccine, I still have the ear pain, swollen lymph node under my ear/behind my jaw, sinus pain, muscle pain at the base of my skull, a headache, and extreme pressure in my head/sinus area that has not lifted. I started on an antibiotic Friday night (the 22nd) in hopes that this is a sinus and ear infection. Ibuprofen helps the headache slightly but makes the pressure in my head feel worse and makes the joints in my hands and forearms hurt and my fingers swell for some reason which has never happened before for me when taking ibuprofen.

Patient was treated with oral antihistamines (Benadryl, Xyzal). Patient had Vobella injected into upper lip in Feb 2020 and Restylane Kysse in both upper and lower lip in September 2020. Since the swelling was confined to the upper lip, I suspect reaction to the Vobella filler.

Saturday evening or Sunday morning I noticed red splotches along my torso. Sunday they began to itch and I still have them along my neck, back, upper and lower torso, and a few on my legs. I haven?t changed any environmental factors (no new lotions, creams, hair products, diet, or perfumes). Today I used Benadryl cream, but in the past I?ve been putting my regular, non-scented Aveno lotion and coconut oil.

                                                Ever since I received the vaccine, my arm has been extremely sore. Over the next few days, I became incredibly itchy and developed a rash on both of my arms. I now have what I think is considered, &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. There is a red circle around the injection site that is swollen, red, and tender. I then noticed the inside of my mouth was sore and I had blisters developing on the roof of my mouth near my gums. My throat is super sore and swollen and has a yellow pocket on the back of my throat. I am also having body aches under my arms near my ribs and back.

It felt &#39;like when you wake up from anesthesia&#39;.  She had no breathing problems so she didn&#39;t think much of it.  About an hour after receiving vaccine,  she went through a drive thru to order food and &#39;wasn&#39;t thinking right, like I had brain fog&#39;.  That lasted a short time.  About an hour after receiving vaccine, patient noticed lips and mouth were tingling &#39;like I had ate something really spicy&#39;.  This lasted off an on for about an hour.  Later that evening, patient felt dizzy and nauseated.  She laid down and took a nap and woke up feeling better.  Skin started to feel itchy that night.  On 2/27/21, patient woke up with an itchy rash all over back.  Rash is still there.  No other symptoms at this time.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

The symptoms did not go away or worsen so she left when released.  Around 7 the symptoms had progressed to tongue feeling heavy, sore throat, and some difficulty breathing (although her O2 fluctuated between 96-99).  She went to the ER, they administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroids.  Within a couple hours the symptoms had subsided.  As directed, we continued Benadryl and Pepcid for 24 hours.  After being off the Benadryl and Pepcid for 12 -15 hours the symptoms returned, she took one dose of both and now seems to be fine.

                                                I got the injection at 2:50PM. At 5PM, I did an allergic reaction to it: it started tickling in my mouth, I felt my lips and tongue were swelling, my throat was swelling too and I couldn&#39;t swallow anymore and started having difficulty breathing. As I am allergic to peanuts and already did similar reactions, I took my medication: 2 pills 10mg antihistamine and 2 pills of 20mg cortisone. The reaction stopped after I took the pills but by tongue remained a bit swollen for around 2-3 hours.

                                                The night of my vaccine, I had a 100 degree fever, body aches, and chills.  That was resolved by the next day.  On 3/29, I woke up with itchiness behind my right ear.  around 4:30pm on the same day, I had broken out into hives on my face and arms.  By 5:30 they had become itchy and had spread to my neck and chest area.  I had also developed swelling around my eyes, above and below them.  I woke up at 1:30am on 3/30 with itching and burning and more swelling around my eyes.  At 7:30am on 3/30,  my eyes were almost swollen shut and I sought medical attention.  I had itching and burning on my entire body, swollen eyes, full body aches, and joint pain.  I was prescribed steroids and began that course around 1:30pm.  I was also prescribed two epi pens.  Around 6:30pm that night, I had a 100.7 degree fever.  It dropped without the use of a fever reducer within the next two hours. The swelling reduced around my face by 8pm.  This morning, I had almost no swelling, but still a full body rash.  I am treating it with benadryl, zyrtec and maximum strength pepcid, steroids, and calamine lotion.

She was given some water to drink.  Then she said her dizziness was getting worse and was having a really bad headache.  I asked if I can call an ambulance for her to take her to ER she refused worrying about the cost.  Her mother was contacted and was notified of the situation.  Once patient started getting worse and started having visual changes with flashing lights, 911 was called immeidately and paramedics took over.

                                                Normal side effects: headache, chills, body aches/stiffness, joint pain, sore injection arm, fatigue  Side effects had slow onset after shot was given. However, I took Tylenol (650mg) preemptively because of my experience with the first dose. This may have affected onset time and severity. Side effects had set in by 9 PM that evening, with the worst being the headache. Ringing in my ears (tinnitus) came with the onset of other side effects, and the severity coincided with the severity of the headache. I took Tylenol, which helped reduce (but not eliminate) side effects, but ringing in ears persisted, if only less intensely.  I have continued to take Tylenol (and occasionally Ibuprofen--I tend to avoid because of stomach sensitivity), with all symptoms lessening over the week (5/3-5/10), except for ringing in ears and slight headache. The ringing does not seem to go away with OTC meds (Tylenol, Ibuprofen). It is worse in the left ear, which is the side I got the shot in.

                                                Received second dose of Moderna vaccine on 3/6/21. On 5/17/21 I experienced an unknown rash and lip swelling. I was given a steroid injection and steroid creme. The doctor said there was a slight chance this reaction resulted from my COVID vaccination.

I told patient we offer Moderna at this location, patient said she definitely recieved Moderna but forgot/lost her card and that she would get the information from her first location later to fill out the card. She found the card and realized she actually received Pfizer for her first vaccination. I talked to patient and she is experiencing normal reactions (low grade fever, headache, chills) that are common with the COVID vaccination.

                                                Initially had a very sore arm then during the night I woke up with hives all over my body. They were very itchy and red. I went to the medical clinic on Monday and attempted to use Pepcid, allegra, and Benadryl. That did not work so the following week I went and was prescribed an oral steroid, prednisone 10 mg Tabs pack 48s. During the course of the steroid the hives went away. Then after the steroid ended heartburn arose and the hives returned again all over my body and they also were on my lips. Went to the medical clinic again and the hives were combined with &#39;moderna arm&#39; however the moderna arm arose throughout my body and has consistently shown up since. Went to an allergist and was also placed on montelukast 10mg tablets. The hives continued, Benadryl, 24hr allegra, and 24 Zyrtec were used to lessen it but did not work. Now I have to take the biologic Zolair to take care of the hives and if I do not take the shot they come back every 4 weeks. The &#39;moderna arm&#39; rash has shown up consistently on both of my hands every morning then goes away later in the day.

                                                Severe headache lasting more than two weeks. After 3 days I went to the emergency room. I went due to a number of symptoms(fever, chills, nausea, severe body aches, neck stiffness, blurred vision) the headache was my chief complaint and thought to be the cause of the other issues. My heart rate upon arrival was 223 causing me to be hooked up to a cardiac monitor, and my blood pressure was 72/56. I was swabbed for the flu and Covid. Both resulted negative. All labs blood and urine were normal. X-ray or chest was done and showed all clear. CT scan was also done and to my knowledge was clear. I was told I needed to get a lumbar puncture to check for meningitis because it was the only other thing they could think of. Upon doing the lumbar puncture CSF gushed from the needle used to puncture and my headache was gone within minutes. I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri. Thought to be caused by my IUD. After going to see my OBGYN I was informed that my COVID vaccine had caused my IUD to release and unusual amount of hormones and that?s what caused the excess buildup of spinal fluid in my brain. I?m still, almost two months later experiencing headaches and back/neck pain. My IUD is still not working properly and is scheduled to be removed temporarily.

                                                around 4AM of 01/06/21 (approximately 10 hours after receiving injection) I woke up with stomach cramps, feeling as if I needed to have a bowel movement which is extremely unusual at that hour. I went to the bathroom and ended up having extreme diarrhea. Went back to sleep, proceeded to wake up at 7am for work (I work at a hospital). Went to work, temperature upon arrival to work at 8am was 96.7. Didn&#39;t start to experience any other symptoms till around 10-11am. Developed a headache and thought, &#34;hm this is weird, I haven&#39;t had a headache since I had COVID but I hope it goes away soon.&#34; Then I went to lunch at noon and everything hit me all at the same time - freezing and sweating profusely, headache became so debilitating that it was burning/hurting my eyes, uncontrollably shaking, felt so weak (body aches all over, everything hurt). Took my temperature while I was at home for lunch and it was 101.5 and my heart rate was 160 (my heart rate is usually high because I take a stimulant but it is never that high). Went back to the hospital because I wanted to go to the ER and needed to get the rest of my belongings anyways. The ER physician and staff found the same things when doing initial vitals - high fever and heart rate. I made the ER physician aware of the fact that I had just received the vaccine the night before while also just having had COVID less than one month prior. I was instructed to go home at that point to get rest and recover. For the rest of the day on 01/6/21 and all of 01/7/21 I had to take off work because of adverse symptoms and effects. For all of 01/7/21 I was extremely fatigued and the headache never went away until 01/08/21.  On 01/08/21 I returned to work and symptoms diminished.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  About 8 hours after the shot, I had chills and developed swelling on the right side of my upper lip. In the morning the swelling and chills were gone, and I had a really stiff upper shoulder and up to my neck. I feel totally fine the next morning, but concerned about a worse reaction to the second shot.

I couldn&#39;t; I was stuck in the state of my body shaking and unable to see anything. After the two times, I had the shakes.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                Around 5 pm on 2/11 (day of vaccination) I began to notice a very sore arm and dry mouth/dehydration. Drank water and continued as normal. Around 2 am of 2/12 I woke up with chills and had been sleeping very restlessly.  I had body aches in my arm, legs and back. Around 3am my temperature was 100.2. I also felt very faint when standing and thought I may pass out.  3 times when standing, I had to quickly sit down to avoid it. I do suffer from vasovagal syncope so this may be unrelated to vaccination. I took Tylenol and drank more water. Temp rose to about 100.6 before beginning to drop at around 4 am. I continued to take Tylenol every 4 hours and it helped keep temp below 100 but towards the end of the 4 hours, it would start to rise again. I ate normally and drank extra water due to feeling dehydrated still. Around 1 PM 2/12 I started to feel nauseous and had an upset stomach. I was still have a general body aches and elevated temperature around 99.5. My normal temp is usually about 98.0. Nausea led to diarrhea 1 time. Symptoms continued until approximately 8 pm when very quickly the body aches, nausea, fever and soreness in injection arm all went away. None of these symptoms have returned and it is now 2/13 at 8 pm.   I did test positive for Covid-19 on December 28, 2020 but have been fully recovered with no symptoms since 1/8/2021.

Around 5am pain completely went away. No more issues since then.

After 2 weeks, it progressed to my neck, but was manageable with over the counter lotion. After the second shot a month later, the itching progressed to my chest and arms. It?s become painfully itchy and I believe it to be eczema. However, I have never had this skin condition in the past. I have kept the skin clean and tried many treatments short of going to a doctor. Rubbing alcohol, witch hazel, eucerin cream, hydrocortisone cream, Benadryl anti itch cream, Benadryl, washing my bedding, and cutting my hair away from the affected areas provided no relief.  It?s been 2 months since the first symptoms and nothing has changed. In fact, it?s progressively gotten worse.

I woke up on the floor (syncope), ran to the bathroom and started vomiting. I do not know how long I was unconscious for.

                                                Friday, March 12th, 2021 at 11am I had a severe anaphylactic reaction to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. My throat began to swell and became very short of breath. My chest was tight and felt as if it was being crushed. A nurse walked by me and noticed me grabbing my chest and immediately put me on a gurney. They took my mask off and discovered my lips were swelling and turned blue. My vitals were taken and was was given epinephrine in my left thigh. EMS was called and on board was given an IV Benadryl and steroids. Once at the hospital I was given Ativan, Pepsid and more Benadryl. I was discharged around 4pm and was back at the ED 3/13/21 early morning when I woke up with not being able to breathe, my throat swelling and crushing feeling in my chest. I was given more Benadryl and fluids, and was released 8am. 3/16/21 I came back to the ED as advised by a triage nurse on the phone, as I was having trouble breathing and the same crushing feeling in my chest.

                                                I have had floaters in my eyes since the vaccine. I started to use  refreshing eye drops on Saturday March 13. I am not sure if the acne cream got in my eye the night before the vaccine. it is called Retin A cream 0.025%. I have also been feeling very weak. I got a B12 injection on my butt for energy(Friday, march 12). My legs feel like they are in pain and the hurt when I walk. I also had a lot of pelvic pain after the vitamin injection. I drank ibuprofen March 14 at night. I woke up feeling very weak. Before going to bed on March 15 I drank Tylenol. I still feel pain in my legs today and now I have lower back pain.

No loss of breathing or swallowing. Pt took 25mg of Benadryl which stopped the swelling within the hour.  By 20 minutes, left side of face from top of head to collarbone became numb which persisted over the next 72 hours, with numbness/discomfort lasting through the week after the injection (today is 1 week). Twitching of fingers, arms, and legs also began around minute 20 and subsided about an hour after injection. No weakness of muscles or droopiness. Pt also experienced severe pain at injection site over the following 48 hours, immobilizing the left arm.

Then on saturday night after dinner and dessert (all things I&#39;ve eaten recently so nothing new) I began swelling in my lips and under my right eye. I took 6 doses of off-brand benadryl and it would only decrease the swelling by very small increments. My breathing was alright, but to this day as of 03/22/2021 my lips are still slightly puffy.

                                                Patient was vaccinated around 10:55 AM. Within a couple of minutes she started feeling lightheaded, sweaty, and had blurry vision while sitting. She reported no history of blood sugar issues, but she said she only had some donut to eat today. I initially gave her three glucose tablets and a bottle of water, which she sipped. She reported feeling better within a few minutes. I checked her blood pressure at 10:59 AM. It read low at 81/44 with a pulse of 73. But, I checked again since I doubted the accuracy of the reading. The second reading was 101/56, with a pulse of 79. Patient said she was feeling better, but continued to sit. I gave her one more glucose tablet to equal a total of 16 g of carbs given. She sat for at least fifteen minutes until she felt well enough to get up and shop. She checked back after shopping and said she was fine.

This passed after about 5 minutes. 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, my throat and tongue started to swell. Went to the ER after benadryl wore off and the swelling returned. Am still managing the swelling of the throat and tongue 4 days later.

This went away after an hour. Then a few hours later the same thing happen in my left arm. That also resolved in a few hours. 26 hours after my shot, at just before 1:00pm the following day, I felt the subtle cramping at the base of my pinky and ringer finger on my left hand. This has lasted for a half an hour.   Other than the above, I have experienced fatigue, pain at injection site, slight nose congestion, and dry throat/slight throat discomfort (i.e. feeling dry and only slightly swollen or congested)

Arm was very sore for a while and on March 6th, it started turning red and swollen at injection site. It grew to about 5 inches long and 4 inches wide. Arm was very sore. Did not itch. After 5 days of growing, it went away overnight. I used warm compresses to help.

The patient refused transport to the hospital and left with her significant other as her driver after she was feeling normal again.

                                                Certain foods/drinks/tastes now taste like metal. So far the specific tastes are: hazelnut, peppermint, and Gatorade. There are others that I can?t pin point as the cause of the taste.  I got COVID in February and lost my taste and smell for around a month.

Immediately after my first shot I experienced distorted tastes and smells. Lots of food still (after 5 weeks) taste nasty to me. Meats, fruits, and more. Hard to describe the smell and taste, sometimes soapy. My reactions to the second shot similar to first. Cold chills achey, feel really hot, fever, tingly arm, etc.

She said that she felt light-headed and that she was itching all over. I gave her Benadryl 25 and asked her wait around. After about 10 minutes she said that she needed my help. She said that she needed an EpiPen shot because her heart was racing, she was sweating, and her tongue was beginning to feel swollen. I gave her the EpiPen shot and called 911. She was released from the hospital about midnight.

This would happen every time I got out of bed and stood up. Lasted about 2 hours.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

                                                (Written next day) Patient stated that shortly after receiving the vaccine approximately 30-60 min minutes later she started to feel swelling in her face as well as her lips. She took a photo of this and showed it to me today and well. The swelling around the eyes seemed minimal. Her lips were swollen. She also notes that she felt tired and had a mild shortness of breath where she felt more comfortable sitting up. She states these symptoms have somewhat improved, though she has been experiencing increasing nausea since yesterday and continues to feel that way. She states that she does not believe she is pregnant, she has an IUD. She also noticed some body aches yesterday, continuing this morning, but they seem to be improving. They do improve greatly with ibuprofen at home.

Aunt said the symptoms are not improving. Patient had tested negative for Covid the day she got the vaccine.

                                                Several minutes after the vaccine she became light headed, EMT evaluated her and stated she was tachycardic (did not give a pulse) and was initially unable to find a BP.  She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

About another 10 minutes or so later, I had tongue and slight lip tingling.  Because they thought I may have a reaction, they sent me to the ED.  But I never developed any facial or throat swelling and never had an anaphylactic reaction.  After about 24 hours the tingling went away.

                                                Woke up around 5AM with a severe headache and tenderness at injection site. Throat was also very dry. Was not able to go back to sleep due to pain. Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

I had laid on back; and my arm and feet started to  feel like Charlie-horse. It was very hard to speak. My words became slurred as I was speaking. I felt like I was having heart attack.  I had the worst flu symptoms for about 2 days and symptoms went away.

                                                A few days after the shot I had a horrible headache behind the ear and right side of forehead that wouldn&#39;t go away with tylenol for about 3 days. 1 week after the vaccine I had routine blood drawn, afterwards ate breakfast and had jaw pain and couldn&#39;t open my mouth fully. Within a few hours my whole right side of my face was weak. I was able to get into the dr at 2 pm and was prescribed antiviral Valtrex and pregnozone for 1 week. Started taking them immediately and doing facial excersizes. No improvement so far.

She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

                                                Initially sore arm and chills around 8pm. Around 2 am notes Fever, chills, body aches all over, a killer headache, nausea and I could not stay asleep. I took 2 extra strength Tylenol at that time, put an ice pack on my forehead, and drank a Pedialyte.   In addition to those, at about 4 I had ringing in my left ear and then lost the hearing in it. I just went to bed. When I woke up, around 10am on Friday, I could hear, but super dizzy. I couldn?t really walk without  feeling like I?m going to fall over, especially with turns. All symptoms continued throughout all of Friday.  I continued to take the Tylenol per the instructions on the bottle with my last dose around 5pm, I also drank 3 more pedialytes throughout the day in addition to plenty of other fluids. Took a warm shower around 7PM which seemed to help some with body aches and chills, however, dizziness/vertigo remained.  Saturday I woke up several times drenched in sweat. Around 9am my fever was gone. Still feeling a little ?off? in terms of balance/vertigo but nothing compared to Friday.  Slight body aches remain. Other symptoms gone.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.

                                                I got my period out of the blue the following morning. It was the worst period / PMS of my life. I was having full blown contractions, waves of pain and heat so much that I was throwing up. I also had diarrhea and very heavy bleeding. Once I was able to keep ibuprofen down I was absolutely fine and the symptoms dissipated. In total this pain, vomiting and diarrhea, unable to think or drink water or communicate lasted about 2 hours.

She was assessed, had no other symptoms - no SOB, no itching, no chest pain, etc.  She waited in the clinic area over an hour after she was provided Benadryl liquid 25 mg po.  She sat quietly reading a book and was able to drink a bottle of water.  Per nurse&#39;s recommendation, her sister presented to the office to escort her home.  She left the office walking and talking without any problems.  BP prior to leaving the office was 126/89, pulse 85.

It felt like my heart was beating irregular, vision went blury, full body flush, skin was hot,  my chest was heavy and I had shortness of breath. I told the staff that I was having a reaction so they had me sit in a private room and watched me. After sitting for a few minutes the feeling went away. I have not had any side effects since.

Her vision blurred; she felt dizzy; she had a hard time hearing herself, although she could hear me fine; and she felt faint.  We had her sit back down and got her some water, checking on her every 5 minutes or so.  She was still dizzy, but not as faint.  She also reported a cold sweat.  We got her some orange juice and continued checking on her.  She called her husband to come and get her.  She was able to get up and walk out of her own accord with her husband.  We will follow up with her tonight to see how she is doing.

I decided to drink some orange juice and when I went to sit back down I started feeling extremely dizzy, I got a very bitter taste in my mouth, my whole body started tingling and my lips and tongue and hands especially started feeling numb.I managed to get to bathroom floor where I grabbed some water and wiped it over my neck but I continued to feel worse where I couldn?t even control what my body was doing and I had diarrhea. The ?snow? in front of my eyes got worse too where I couldn?t almost see anything for over probably 3 minutes and I broke in cold sweat.After the diarrhea I had a very sharp pain in my lower abdomen. That all lasted a few minutes and I didn?t have phone on me and I was alone so I helplessly sat on the floor through it all til I started feeling bit by bit better.The fever continued for 48 hours as well as extreme arm pain for 3 days where I got my vaccine.

                                                I have had very very mild tinnitus for a few years now, where it is only noticeable in dead silence. I sleep with a sound machine and that fixes the problem completely. But after getting the vaccine, I have ringing in my left ear that is 10x louder than it ever has been before. My ears feel clogged. It is taking over my life. I can&#39;t focus. I can&#39;t sleep.

About 5 minutes later 911 instructed us to administer second dose of epinephrine as she was unable to speak to us. She remained upright and alert until the paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Total time in the pharmacy area after reaction occurred was approximately 20 minutes until paramedics arrived.

The next day (Today) I noticed I couldn&#39;t purse my lips around a straw, and my right side isn&#39;t moving at all. My eye won&#39;t blink unless I force it, and my lip won&#39;t move.

                                                This patient received her first Moderna vaccine in the right deltoid at approximately 6:45pm on 4/19/21, and left the pharmacy around 7pm. By 7:30pm, she had developed a red rash over her chest, neck, and arms. This rash eventually became very itchy and she developed a bad headache. The patient was advised to take Benadryl liquid, which she did. When her lips began to feel tingly, she was advised to go to an urgent care facility. At urgent care, she was also given Pepcid and told to continue the Benadryl. By the next morning, the itching and redness had lessened some, but she still has the bad headache.

                                                Patient vomited and got dizzy within 15 minutes of receiving vaccine. She stated her tongue felt numb and she had chest pain. We gave her 50mg of Benadryl and sat her down to observe her. She said that her symptoms somewhat resembled what she experiences in an episode of POTS but she never had the tongue numbness or chest pain before.  When talking to us she could not make eye contact and her responses were slow but clear. Within the next 15 minutes her symptoms did not improve and she stated her right hand felt numb. We called 911. The EMTs said all her vitals were good but they took her to the closest ER.

A law enforcement officer witnessed her becoming faint and ran over to attend her. I was called over to assess her as well. The law enforcement officer called EMS. The patient stated that she felt faint, dizzy, she said she had a headache, blurry vision, and was nauseous. The patient appeared sweaty and she appeared to loose consciousness briefly twice. She did not show any signs of redness, rash, or swelling. After sitting for a few minutes, and before EMS arrived, the patient said she was improving. She did not lose consciousness anymore but she still had a headache, nausea, and blurry vision. When EMS arrived they recommended that she get checked out at the emergency room, but the patient refused stating that she did not want to go to the hospital and that she was feeling better. The patient called her parents and they came and picked her up.

                                                Patient is a 25 year old female. She presented to the clinic for her second dose of Moderna LOT #003C21A.  According to patient&#39;s husband she has no significant past medical history but has ?passed out? with vaccines.  No reaction noted with her first COVID vaccine.  Approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection today she told her husband that she wasn?t feeling well.  She said was light headed and nauseated.  Patient then proceeded to become nonresponsive.  Her eyes deviated upward and her whole body became stiff.  Her skin had notable pallor.  She was lowered to the ground by staff, myself, and her husband, and put in a supine position with her legs elevated.  911 was called. This episode lasted approximately 40-60 seconds when she became responsive and cried out for husband.  Her muscles relaxed and she became notably upset.  She kept saying she wasn?t able to see or feel her extremities.  Her lack of vision resolved within 10-15 seconds. She had weakness in her arms and legs but was able to squeeze her hands on command.  She was alert and oriented X3.  BP was 130/90.  The patient was stable when the ambulance arrived to transport her to Hospital.

                                                Experienced dizziness that lasted several weeks. This dizziness lasted most of each day.  Took about 8 weeks to subside. Then, started to have tinnitus in both ears for about a month, and now this has started to subside. Primary care doctor did basic lab workup and everything was normal. Went to ENT doctor and was given steroids, however elected not to take them. ENG showed horizontal nystagmus to both right and left side. Was told usually this sort of thing happens due to inflammation and is usually post-viral. However, there is a slight possibility it could be due to anything that causes inflammation (aka the vaccine).

About 2 days after, I started to notice tingling in my throat and difficulty breathing.  I could see my throat was swollen and started to close up.  I went to doctor&#39;s office and they prescribed me antibiotics (amoxicillin) and steroids (methylprednisone).  I took the medications but the tonsils are still swollen. At this time, I decided to go to ENT specialist.  I was then diagnosed with Mono.

Impacts daily life constantly and increases frequency and severity of migraines, leading to an ER visit for severe migraine in March25. unequal pressure has also effected sinus cavity and resulted in constant dry mouth. Symptoms seem to be chronic and ultimately leading to expensive alternative medical solutions.

The red circle is raised and tender to touch and very warm.  Additionally I noticed several tiny speckled bruises on my body. Some on my chest and some under my arm. I also have a swollen tender left eye lid. My eye could be vaccine related or not, I just noticed it the morning after I got the shot.

                                                A few hours after receiving my first dose vaccine shot, I developed intense ringing in my left ear. Since then it?s been consistent but worse at some times. I went to see my doctor a week before I was due for my second dose shot. I was still having the ringing in my left ear and she gave me a steroid shot to hopefully suppress my bodies reaction to the shot. It did seem like the ringing got better after a week. But then my ear went back to consistently ringing again a few days later. I did not get my second dose of the vaccine at my Doctors suggestion. I have an appointment made with an ENT specialist in July.

Numbness in tongue went away, slightly have feeling in rest of the affected area. Still do not have feeling completely back to this day. Did not seek care for numbness. 3 weeks after receiving vaccine chest pain, intermittently  and constant dizziness. Last day of march I was driving and stopped at a hotel, next morning woke up and still had severe chest pain and heart palpitations and dizziness. Went to ER April 1st they did x-ray and labs.
