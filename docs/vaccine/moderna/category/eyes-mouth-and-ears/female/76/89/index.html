                                                Developed a severe headache within 2-3 hours of receiving vaccine. Took 2 Tylenol. Headache abated but did not resolve. Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

The EMT&#39;s came, checked my lungs, etc.  and talked me through the episode which lasted about 15 minutes.  Then the swelling subsided.  I suspect it had, because I had dermal fillers approximately a year ago.  I had no other adverse affects, except for tiredness that evening.  People should be warned about this because it is a frightening event.  I have never had an adverse reaction to a vaccine before.

I was awake and knew what was happening.  I don?t know how long it lasted. When the episode was over, I went to sleep.  I awakened in about 3 hours, went to the rest room, and returned to bed.  I was uneasy  and thought I might fall.  I slept another three hours and went to the bathroom again. I felt a little better. I got up in about two more hours and felt a little better. Didn?t feel good all day and my arm was really sore.

Usually I have a path of Z&#39;s going left to right and then at my age I had  a very slight headache. These looked different with broken up lights. and I woke up with them.Then on Feb 24  :1t 1:15 I had my second. The next morning I woke up with a hazy eyesight but I thought it might be a migraine. I somehow knew it wasn&#39;t but didn&#39;t go to a doctor. The next morning definitely knew.  Saw 2 doctors one in emergency situation he placed me on steroids but I had lost part of my eye sight.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, stated she was sneezing and coughing few days before receiving her first dose vaccine. Concomitant medications reported included iron, metolazone, nicardipine, simvastatin, torsemide, levothyroxine, glimepiride, apixaban, potassium chloride, acetyl salicylic acid, and donepezil 5mg.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 032L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The route of administration was not provided.  On an unspecified date in Jan 2021 after receiving the first dose vaccine, the patient experienced not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, and didn&#39;t want to get up.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient was losing her balance and confused. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with renal failure, as well as, severe urinary tract infection that was septic.  On an unknown date post hospitalization, the patient tested positive for Covid-19.  Treatment drug administered included Tylenol, Azithromycin, Promethazine, 325mg aspirin, and Vitamin D.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, like not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, confusion, loss of balance, renal failure, severe urinary tract infection that was septic, and Covid-19 positive test were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19.  The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-033912:

On 1/19/2021 the pt reported she could not speak with me (RN) further as she was about to go on a zoom meeting with her allergist to discuss the event. RN asked pt to call the LHD back.  1/20/2021 RN called pt to discuss further, pt stated she is in the grocery store and cannot speak. RN asked pt what the allergist recommended. Pt stated the allergist recommended getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine however with additional pre-medications. Pt stated she could not speak with RN further and would call me back.  1/25/2021 - pt did not call clinic back. RN called pt to get more details on the event. Pt reported her allergist would like her to get the 2nd injection in the hospital, while taking Singulair the night before and Zyrtec and Benadryl the day of. RN advised the pt her allergic reaction is a contraindication to receiving the 2nd dose per CDC guidelines. Pt verbalized understanding and will discuss with her allergist further.  Pt also mentioned possible allergy to Polysorbate during call on 1/25/2021 however she reports because she tolerates Miralax on a regular basis her allergist does not believe it to be a true allergy. Pt did not mention this in VAMS. I was not the vaccinator.

She was cultured for infection and everything came back negative.

She has a history of shingles that affected this eye but it had been quiet and she does not seem to be responding to anti viral medication.

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 80-year-old, female patient who suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia).                                                                                                                      The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Called at 8 am this morning to inform me of a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She received the vaccine on Tuesday, 1/19/21. The next day she noted the back of her tongue on the R side was swollen. On Thurs, 1/21/21, she reports she woke up with the back of her tongue swollen on both sides such that she had some trouble speaking and needed to be very careful with chewing so she would not bite her tongue. She stated she also had drippy sinuses and an earache which then woke her up several times during the night last night. Today she reports the tongue swelling is only to the back R side of her tongue. She continues to have ear pain. She states she had not reported the symptoms to anyone before her call because she had not felt the symptoms were life-threatening. I asked her if she had taken any benedryl, and she stated the only medication she had taken was her analgesic herbal supplement. She states she has never had a vaccination reaction in the past. I advised her to call her PCP and be seen, which she was able to do. After she was seen, she called and stated while the clinician was looking at her tongue, it started to have shooting pains when she moved it to the right. The clinician stated her tongue and throat were not visibly swollen, noted no swollen lymph nodes, and noted no ear abnormalities.

My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins.

I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

I googled search and found it was a rare but real reaction vaccine, called COVID ARM. According to the information I read it occurs between 7-9 days after vaccination. Mine occurred exactly 7 days later. I have been putting Hydrocortisone cream with Aloe in it and on it. Today it is more sore then itching and still red. The Hydrocortisone with Aloe seemed to help.   I have also noticed my eyes have been watering a lot more since receiving the vaccine.

By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

                                                My mother has experienced a severe reaction to her vaccine. Diagnosed with brain encephalopathy probably caused by molecular mimicry in response to the Covid vaccine, she is now being treated as an inpatient at the Clinic.  She was fully independent- living alone, mobile, with excellent cognitive function.  On January 21, 2021 she received her 1st Moderna vaccine. Subsequently family noticed small balance changes, slight fine motor coordination changes (handwriting, etc) and a little forgetfulness not previously seen. Everything was chalked up to her being 89 years old.  She remained independent and relatively fully functional.  Patient is now unable to stand without assistance, leans backward when trying to stand, has developed a spastic tremor bilaterally in her arms, and her cognition is completely altered.  Hallucinations, memory loss, can follow some directions but not all, speech clear but inappropriate.  This declines DAILY. As of March 7th, she could not identify immediate family members in a photo. These changes have all occurred within the past few weeks and appear to have an acute underlying cause not related to age.    Medical staff are looking at an autoimmune encephalitis picture based on the antibodies developed from the vaccine attacking the tissue in the brain and spinal cord that resembles the small piece of the vaccine.    She is currently at the Clinic affiliated hospital. At this time, family is contacting Clinic main campus to request further investigation.   Photographic evidence of rapid decline available, but not able to attach to this form:   Available are three pictures of a log patient keeps with her vitals that she was doing every day.  1. Personal log of vital signs pre Covid vaccine/dose 1 - you can see the handwriting is concise, clear, and orderly.   2. Personal log of vitals after Covid dose 1 on Jan. 21 - slight changes in the handwriting and orderliness but still ok.  3. Personal log of vitals after Covid vaccine dose 2  Feb. 17 - note the illegible handwriting, missing entries, and no spatial awareness of line alignment.  Available are three photos of crossword puzzles she does every day.    1. Puzzle dated Feb.12. Demonstrates her ability to accurately fill most answers with clear writing.   2. Puzzle dated Feb.19 shows an ability to fill in only a couple answers with obvious handwriting changes.   3. Puzzle dated Feb. 21 shows inability to complete, and a strange discrepancy between ability and inability- note 29 across and 18 down.  Patients outcome is undetermined as diagnosis/treatment and prognosis are ongoing.

                                                This was the 2nd Moderna Shot on 2-18-2021.  She received the first shot on 1-22-2021. Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
