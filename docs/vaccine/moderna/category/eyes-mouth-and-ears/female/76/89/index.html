The EMT&#39;s came, checked my lungs, etc.  and talked me through the episode which lasted about 15 minutes.  Then the swelling subsided.  I suspect it had, because I had dermal fillers approximately a year ago.  I had no other adverse affects, except for tiredness that evening.  People should be warned about this because it is a frightening event.  I have never had an adverse reaction to a vaccine before.

                                                Almost exactly 24 hours after 2nd shot, my mom was getting her hair done and she started breathing hard.  Hairstylist removed her mask and she then passed out.  Called 911.  They observed my mom sweating, her lips and hands were swollen, she was slack jawed, pale and clammy.   After several minutes she came out of it.  Was given a piece of candy thinking it was a sugar low, but her sugar was high 285 @9:00am.  Her color was still pale and she was still incoherent.  While still on with 911, she became more lucid and said she was feeling better, so ambulance was canceled.   I drove her home and checked her sugar @11:00 - 295 and BP 125/55 pulse 75.  She stayed with me for the rest of Saturday.  Her sugar was still high Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  Upon checking her blood sugar log, her sugar had gone up for a week following the first shot.

                                                The evening  of the first shot on February 5, I had a strong headache, muscle aches and was extremely tired for the next two days.  I had brain fog for the next 2 weeks.  Tylenol and Advil mostly relieved physical discomfort.    I had the second shot March 16.  The next day I had a severe headache, no energy, achy body,  chills and fever and on the second day after the shot my temperature was 101.4 - 101.8.  Tylenol and Advil relieved the symptoms.  Today, one week after the second shot I developed a pungent chemical taste in my mouth and a similar sense of smell.  The tip of my tongue is tingling, and while I can breathe in deeply,  my chest feels heavy, like I&#39;m not getting enough oxygen.

                                                I had a severe migraine - and I don&#39;t have headaches. My whole face hurt.  (I have two optic aneurisms and I was afraid they were starting to bleed out.) My eye was running water even more at that point and I also had some mucus in my eye. I went to ER.  January 8 and they did a CT scan - and they gave me something IV for pain. They told me to take extra strength Tylenol every four hours and that didn&#39;t help. After one hour, I was in severe pain again. At that point, both eyes were tearing. I went to the dentist (Monday)  -and they did x-rays - (  to see if I had a tooth issue and I went to my ENT doctor  (Tuesday)- and he said it didn&#39;t appear that I had a major infection.  still in severe pain - she gave me a prescription to get rid of infection in my eyes. She gave me a steroid shot - which stopped the pain. The following week, I had an appt with an ophthalmologist- I was not in pain any more and my eyes had pretty much cleared up. He said I probably had a viral or bacterial infection prior and when I got the vaccine then that was why I got a migraine.  2nd vaccine - 30th of January (8:30) - I slept all that day - I was sleepy the whole day and the Sunday, I had flu like symptoms and after that I was fine. This week, I have the infection in my eyes again. I went back to the Dr yesterday to get an antibiotic because I was having the same kind of infections. This time - infection in my left eye, with tearing and mucus. They had me do the eye drops again and nasal spray I&#39;ve been using.

                                                On approx. March 6th I noticed I was having a ringing in my ears. It has persisted since then, no better no worse.  It does not keep me up at night but it is annoying.  I don&#39;t know if it is related to the vaccine shot but I kept thinking that it could be a delayed reaction.  Maybe it started before but at a lower level and took until the 6th for me to notice. This week (week of March 22) I read a news article about someone who committed suicide because he was having severe bouts of tinitis since having had a case of covid.  That made me think that my tinitis could be related to the vaccine.  I tried to red up on tinitis and it seems that there is no treatment for this. Am I correct in that information?

Called Dr. and he put me on antibiotic (10 days) thinking I had ear infection. Still couldn&#39;t hear well. On 3/1 at 11:45 am had 2nd Moderna vaccine shot. By midnight I had fever, chills. 3/2 fever, chills am, very tired. 3/2 in the evening I thought I would watch tv.  I turned it on and the mouths were moving but I couldn&#39;t understand anything they were saying. 3/8 Went to ENT and had a hearing test. I still had tinnitus. Test results showed that I have a moderate to severe hearing loss in conversation area in both ears. 3/9 Went to ENT who prescribed prednisone beginning with 60 mg. 3/30 Had another hearing test at ENT. Test results showed no improvement, hearing still as on 3/8. So end results I have tinnitus all the time and a hearing loss that I did not have before taking the vaccine.

Today the sixth day and eyes no longer feel swollen but very irritated.  I am using refresh tears and Claritin 10mg.

                                                I awoke on 1/23/2021 (Saturday) morning to find my face and especially my lips swollen.  Contacted doctor&#39;s office for the on-call; he strongly suggested I visit the ER. Was kept there for 2-3 hours for observation.  Was considered &#34;hypertensive,&#34;  routine blood work done (CBC, metabolic panel) all of which were normal.  Was given Prednisone and ZyrTec.   After no change in my condition, was discharged with instruction to contact primary physician and continue to take Prednisone and ZyrTec for the next four more days.   The reason for the facial and lip swelling could not be determined......It was indicated that the swelling could be one of several things including an allergic reaction to something topical like a lip balm (I used a Blistix application before bed), a reaction to one of my medication (BP med-Olmesartan, which they told me to discontinue) or less likely a reaction to the COVID vaccine.

The tingling disappeared in the fingertips, but my tongue, although no longer tingling, still feels sore and irritated almost two weeks after the injection.

                                                I developed all the symptoms of Covid, except fever. The cough was the worst. Had taste, but it is still off; nothing tastes right. I had a Covid test on 01/24/2021 that came back negative. I had two more tests in the hospital on 2/9/2021 that also came back negative. I went to hospital on doctor&#39;s orders due to some blurry vision and concern about blood clots, which I did not have. Symptoms persisted until 2/12/2021.

After 48 hours the feeling did not subside so I made an appointment to visit my oral surgeon.  On 02/04/2021 I visited my oral surgeon who took  multiple pictutes of my mouth/palate and felt it was a reaction to the vaccine.  She prescribed a mouthwash as treatment and a follow up in 2 weeks.

                                                Sudden dizziness with some nausea and cold drenching sweat - no fever - extremely weak and fatigued and could barely stand and then severe headache came on about 10 minutes into episode.  Dizziness lasted approximately 2 hours until I could safely move and then began to subside.  I noticed my eyes did not want to focus well and was seeing spots when I tried writing down what happened.  Chills began and I felt extremely cold, my head felt &#34;foggy&#34; and tight, ringing in ears started and headache moved to migraine level.  Slight fever 99.8. Main dizziness did pass after about 2 hours but other things continue to linger on an off.  I just feel &#34;off&#34;.  I have actually heard other seniors mention some of these very symptoms so am not super alarmed, however, I did not have any of these side effects before the vaccine for Covid-19.  I did experience extreme fatigue and bad headaches since I received the first dose on January 27, 2021.    I have not called my doctor regarding these side effects since I have heard many seniors complain of very similar reactions.  I have rested as much as possible, tried to stay hydrated, and taken Tylenol when needed.  For the dizziness I tried to stay as still as possible and put my head between my knees until it finally passed.

                                                The Sat or Sun after I got the vaccine, a quick pain shot around my eyeball in my right eye. It kind of radiated around my eyeball. Then, about a minute later, I experienced a second episode that was less intense. About a week later, I had another quick pain behind my left eye. I had no vision changes or any other symptoms afterwards.

                                                Mom became agitated. Would not sleep. Stayed continuously awake for approximately 40 hours.  Could not be redirected. So tired she was swaying on her feet, but could not be convinced to lay down.  After 2 days we were able to get 50 mg Trazadone from our doctor.  After sleeping for 6-8 hours she then did another 24 hours awake. We upped the dose to 100 mg.  By this point the event had started to pass.    During this time we also noticed mom was running a low fever in the morning. 99.5 - 100.5. It would go away in the afternoon.  During this time mom was hallucinating - having conversations with people who were not there.  Mom&#39;s hearing declined during the event as well.   As of 2 days ago mom&#39;s temperature seems to be back to normal in the morning.  This &#34;event&#34; has impacted mom&#39;s mental and physical decline.  She seemingly overnight now needs help showering and toileting, and sometimes dressing.  (This kind of decline is common for dementia.  Each time over the past 5 years that mom has had some physically stressful even such as hurting her foot or getting a bad stomach virus,  she has come out the other side degraded)  The reason I&#39;m reporting this is that the behavior changes were sudden, seemed to peak, and then subside.  There is a correlation with the second moderna shot, and so I though it was important to report.

I was blind in that eye for about 10 minutes. We drove  right away to my eye doctor, who sent me to the ER. The hospital is Stroke Certified. They admitted me and did a stroke workup. I was in the hospital for 1 day (24 hours) which included overnight.  The treating HCP concluded that I had experienced an ocular stroke. Since it was exactly 4 days after my second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, it most likely was caused by that vaccine.

Pt then called the health department on 1/19/2021 stating once she got home her bottom lip swelled up and so did her eye lids. On 1/19/2021 the pt reported she could not speak with me (RN) further as she was about to go on a zoom meeting with her allergist to discuss the event. RN asked pt to call the LHD back.  1/20/2021 RN called pt to discuss further, pt stated she is in the grocery store and cannot speak. RN asked pt what the allergist recommended. Pt stated the allergist recommended getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine however with additional pre-medications. Pt stated she could not speak with RN further and would call me back.  1/25/2021 - pt did not call clinic back. RN called pt to get more details on the event. Pt reported her allergist would like her to get the 2nd injection in the hospital, while taking Singulair the night before and Zyrtec and Benadryl the day of. RN advised the pt her allergic reaction is a contraindication to receiving the 2nd dose per CDC guidelines. Pt verbalized understanding and will discuss with her allergist further.  Pt also mentioned possible allergy to Polysorbate during call on 1/25/2021 however she reports because she tolerates Miralax on a regular basis her allergist does not believe it to be a true allergy. Pt did not mention this in VAMS. I was not the vaccinator.

Her lips did not appear swollen, she had no shortness of breath, no rash or hives.  The patient has a prior history of allergic reactions to shrimp and other injectables (not specified).    Per the patient, by the time I spoke with her, her symptoms were already resolving.  Her vital signs were recorded and reported to Doctor on duty.  Instructions were received to continue monitoring the patient and she could be discharged when her symptoms were completely resolved.  After an additional 20 minutes, per the patient, her symptoms were all gone and &#34;felt fine&#34;.  The patient was discharged to home.  Patient left the clinic by wheelchair accompanied by her family member.  She was instructed to call 911 if her symptoms worsened and/or contact her primary physician.  The patient was asymptomatic upon discharge.

I have  to eat small things because it is difficult puttinng food in my mouth and I can not feel the food in my mouth on the right side and if food gets over there it gets  between my gums and my cheek,  to drink I  have to position a straw in my mouth on a certain point  and some goes back down in the straw.

I woke up at 5am the 10th and I was shaking and having chills and I was hot and cold... I was dizzy and my eyes hurt. My arm was hurting. I took another tylenol. at 6am I called my NP daughter for advice and she told her it was a reaction of the vaccine. my fever was 102.5. I was advised to take more tylenol and to rest. the fever broke later that morning but I was still experiencing those side effects. 3 days later I&#39;m still not 100%.

By day #7, I called my dr who wasn&#39;t in and spoke to his associate. She said if it got worse to follow up with my dr. They continued to get worse and by Day #9, I called my doctor and sent him a photo. He told me to take benedryl and an antihistamine (zyrtec).  By the next day, the lips were worse, sent another photo and he prescribed Prednisone 20 mg for 5 days. I had a lot of trouble eating and drinking. My lips also felt like pins were constantly being stuck in them. The prednisone helped but it took at least another week before my lips returned to normal. On the advice of my doctor, I did not get the second Moderna dose.

She then had  tenderness in her mouth, used warm salty water which seems to be helping.  She cannot eat any hard food on it due to the discomfort.  She has continued nausea in the evenings.  No problems with the arm where she got the vaccine.  She feels it it getting some better, but the dizziness and nausea is the worst issue.  She did call her doctor and they told her that they could not give her anything for the rash in her mouth, and the chills. They told her that it had to run it&#39;s course.

Too weak to make it to the bathroom by myself.  I felt like I was in a delirium but my husband said that I was not incoherent.  Appetite is still not normal.  Mouth was so dry that I was not able to feel any moisture at all which I feel led to my sinus infection.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

Her cheeks were swollen, she felt that maybe her tongue was as well.  She got the liquid Benadryl and let it stay there and it helps that feeling.  She had taken the Zyrtec and Singulair the night before.  She did the inhaler puff in the morning, the feeling did not go away.  She then took the Ventolin and it seemed to calm down.   The symptoms then went away and didn&#39;t come back, and thought that she was ok.   She felt bad for about a week and a half like she wanted to sleep all the time, but did what she had to do.  She is fine now.

I ALSO FELT A COLD SORE COMING ON.  I TOOK SUDAFED PE AND VALCYCLOVIR, WHICH USUALLY SOLVES THE ISSUE.  THESE SYSMPTOMS CONTINUED AND I CONTINUED WITH SUDAFED AND VALCYCLOVIR.  I SAW MY DENTIST ON FEBRUARY 11 AND WAS TOLD THERE THERE WERE NO ISSUES AND PERHAPS THE PAIN WAS CAUSED BY SINUS ISSUES.  I INCREASED THE VALCYCLOVIR TO THREE TABS A DAY RATHER THAN ONE.  THE TEETH ISSUE SPREAD TO THE LEFT SIDE OF MY  MOUTH AND  TWO MORE COLD SORES APPEARED, ANOTHER ON MY UPPER LIP AND ONE AT THE EDGE OF MY LEFT NOSTRIL.  I HAD A ZOOM MEETING WITH MY DOCTOR ON MARCH 1.  SHE INCREASED THE VALCYCLOVIR TO 1000M. THREE TIMES A DAY.  THE COLD SORES HAVE DISAPPEARED, BUT THE OTHER SYMPTOMS CONTINUE, BUT THE PAIN HAS LESSENED SOMEWHAT.  I TAKE TYLENOL WHEN THE DISCOMFORT BEGINS TO INTERFERE WITH MY DAILY LIFE.

She was cultured for infection and everything came back negative. She was treated initially with antibiotics and anti-viral medication and did not start to improve until was started on frequent topical and oral steroids. She has still lost most of her vision but the inflammation is improving within the anterior chamber but her cornea is still opacified. She has a history of shingles that affected this eye but it had been quiet and she does not seem to be responding to anti viral medication.

She had this for a few days, then about 4 days later called the doctor and went to the clinic and she has canker sores in her mouth.  They told her they would probably go away in a week or two, and it was 2 weeks  yesterday from her vaccine.  They have gotten better but they are not totally gone, and her mouth still does not feel right, but does not feel as bad as it did, does not feel normal.  The tip still feels like she burnt it.

                                                The patient stated that she gets paralyzed after getting vaccines.  I asked her if she had someone in the pharmacy to help her. She said she came alone.  I told her I would have her wait 30mins after dose to make sure there were no issues. After I gave her the shot, she looked at me and said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. Then she looked and said my neck hurts. So I had her take deep breaths with me to get her to calm down as she appeared anxious. She was doing great then she went limp. I held her head up and asked her is she was ok.   She said she was, but then her breathing become shallow. She was un responsive at this time with her tongue pushing her mask off her mouth.  So I lowered her mask and her tongue appeared to be enlarged.  I had my technician call 911 and I gave her a dose of epinephrine 0.3 mg.   She was unresponsive, but breathing on her own.  The paramedics came and got her vitals, placed her on stretcher, and put in a medicine line to give her medications if need be.  She left somewhat unresponsive. They said she should be fine  and took her to ER.

The patient&#39;s medical history as reported by the reporter includes hypertensive, diabetic and had circulation problems. Concomitant medications taken by the patient was not provided.  On 25 Feb2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025A21A) through intramuscular route at unspecified site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unknown date, patient had dizziness, tiredness (which is very unusual for patient), slurred speech numbness and blurred vision and then patient was taken to the ER and diagnosed with having stroke. She was admitted and discharged when her condition improved. As per the follow up report received, the reporter reported that patient ended up in having a stroke which was a medically significant event and she was very very lethargic and had dizziness, felt numbness and tingling in face and fingers. Patient had also  lost speech, lost eyesight which was a medically significant event. Patient went to the hospital where she was diagnosed. Patient was feeling better at the time of reporting and mostly recovered but feeling weak.  Patient went to hospital and treatment activities for events was unknown.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of events, experienced dizziness, tiredness, slurred speech, numbness, blurred vision, stroke, very very lethargic and had tingling in face and fingers was recovering/resoving and lost speech, lost eyesight  was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: There is not enough information to assess the causal association between the reported events and the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.  Critical details such as the onset date of the event is lacking.  Event is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age and underlying medical conditions of hypertensive, diabetic and had circulation problems.

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 80-year-old, female patient who suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia).                                                                                                                      The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Went to Urgent care and was givenMeclizine 12.5mg and Ondansetron 4mg.  Dizziness and nausea lessened over the next 3 days.   Went to ENT doctor - Hearing  test on 3/29/21 revealed total loss of hearing in right ear.  Hearing in left ear was diminished before vaccination and that was about the same after the vaccination.  ENT injected steriod into right ear on 3/31/21.  Second steriod injection on 4/2/21.  No improvement in hearing so far. Dizziness continues off and on.  Still unstable and needs to use a walker.

Saw the doctor who gaver her an injection (forget the name) and the predsolone med pack.  The swelling started to go down 2 days after taking this medication. A week after taking the Moderna vaccine and taking this medication her swelling was gone. Medication was started on Wed Jan 21,2012 and completed on Tue Jan 26, 2021. The swelling didn&#39;t get life threatening but when we noticed that inflamation was worsening and Benadryl didnt work we worried and she went to see the doctor for the treatment described above.

She did not have any symptoms but acknowledged feeling anxious about the side effects prior to arrival for vaccine. After the 2nd dose, she experienced chest pain, jaw pain, body numbness and tingling, and nausea. She did not have vomiting, shortness of breath, syncope, or headache. She was hypertensive on the cardiac monitor and EKG with T wave inversion in lead III, otherwise unremarkable. Heart rate stable, alert and oriented, cardiopulmonary exam benign. She was sent to the ER for further workup, but did not seem to have any allergic reaction to the vaccine. It is unknown what occurred at ER, as she either went to a separate health system or did not go at all.

When we were going home they told me I was swerving, all over the road and they told me to stop, they would drive, I said no, i don&#39;t trust anyone with my car. We got home, I remember changing into my nightgown and was texting someone and I suddenly I stopped. After that I was unresponsive. I would not answer anyone, they said I looked pale and stared into the air. They called my children and they came and emergency personnel was called. I was taken to a hospital and they transferred me to another hospital. I stayed there for 3-4 days. After going home it took me some days to be able to walk without assistance. I wanted to say I had covid in May (1st time) and September (2nd time) . I still do not have taste or smell back from the covid. I can only eat 3 or 4 bites and then I am done.

EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

                                                Called at 8 am this morning to inform me of a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She received the vaccine on Tuesday, 1/19/21. The next day she noted the back of her tongue on the R side was swollen. On Thurs, 1/21/21, she reports she woke up with the back of her tongue swollen on both sides such that she had some trouble speaking and needed to be very careful with chewing so she would not bite her tongue. She stated she also had drippy sinuses and an earache which then woke her up several times during the night last night. Today she reports the tongue swelling is only to the back R side of her tongue. She continues to have ear pain. She states she had not reported the symptoms to anyone before her call because she had not felt the symptoms were life-threatening. I asked her if she had taken any benedryl, and she stated the only medication she had taken was her analgesic herbal supplement. She states she has never had a vaccination reaction in the past. I advised her to call her PCP and be seen, which she was able to do. After she was seen, she called and stated while the clinician was looking at her tongue, it started to have shooting pains when she moved it to the right. The clinician stated her tongue and throat were not visibly swollen, noted no swollen lymph nodes, and noted no ear abnormalities.

I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

I googled search and found it was a rare but real reaction vaccine, called COVID ARM. According to the information I read it occurs between 7-9 days after vaccination. Mine occurred exactly 7 days later. I have been putting Hydrocortisone cream with Aloe in it and on it. Today it is more sore then itching and still red. The Hydrocortisone with Aloe seemed to help.   I have also noticed my eyes have been watering a lot more since receiving the vaccine.

                                                On 2nd day following vaccine I woke with a really hard jaw pain  Its hard to eat, chew  or even open mouth. Now on 2/26/21 it still hurts however it is better, there is a slight swelling at the bottom of my right ear. The bone.( It seems) Question is:  is this a known reaction? About 10 minutes following the vaccine my upper left lip became numb ,but only a few seconds then disappeared.

                                                I had no effect until  after i went to sleep.. After midnight i awoke to itching all over. By morning my eyes were closed to slits and beneath my eyes were  bags as large as teabags, i also had a low grade fever, aches and pains and extreme fatigue. This lasted for a while so ,on Feb 2.. I went to the doctor who gave me a steroid shot. On the 4th  i was not as  achy though still tired and the bags under my eyes persisted ...My eyes were  still itchy and almost closed... She gave me another steroid shot.. i was also advised not to get second steroid shot by several doctors, a doctor and a Immunologist.. also advised against getting second dose. The fatigue remains and the swelling under eyes remains though not as pronounced as it was at first. I would like to be safe. Is the johnson and johnson an option for me? I would not like after effects Please get back to me with some suggestions and advice as to my being fully safe. thank you.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included: methotrexate.   On 22Jan2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of Moderna&#39;s COVD-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273, lot number: not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Later on 22Jan2021, the patient began to develop: excruciating pain - like a labor pain (pain), diarrhea, vaginal bleeding (vaginal haemorrhage), dizziness and broken of the right eye vein that led to bleeding (eye haemorrhage).  She reports these events lasted for 1 day and then stopped. The patient states she still experiences stomach cramping (abdominal pain upper), The patient confirmed she consulted with her physician and blood work was done. The results of the blood work were not provided.   No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported. Patient is wondering if these events are normal and if she should receive her second dose.   The outcome of the events: excruciating pain - like a labor pain (pain), diarrhea, vaginal bleeding (vaginal haemorthage), dizziness and broken of the right eye vein that led to bleeding (eye haemorrhage) is considered to be resolved based on patient reported duration of 1 day. The outcome of event: stomaching cramping (abdominal pain upper) is considered not recovered/not resolved per patient report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 82-years-old, female patient who experienced:  excruciating pain- like a labor pain, abdominal pain upper, diarrhea, vaginal bleeding, dizziness and eye haemorrhage.  Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                The patient received her FIRST dose of Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/26/21 and SECOND dose on 2/23/21. On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS. I was not able to reach the patient in her hospital room today to get additional specifics about where she got the vaccine, its lot number etc., however she is a retired and has indicated her willingness to provide you with any and all additional information you need, and I am also personally very willing to provide any additional information about her eventual outcome.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.  Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded. Headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea and injection site lymphadenopathy are consistent with the product safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.

                                                Blooded stools; Eyes are a little bit itchy; Right eye swollen; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was an 83-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced blooded stools, eyes are a little bit itchy, and right eye swollen.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included magnesium.  On 04 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J00/NA) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the evening of 04 Jan 2021, the patient experienced blooded stools, eyes are a little bit itchy, and right eye swollen. The patient reported having blooded stools that were not diarrhea, but had occurred three or four times. Treatment for the events included non specified allergy medicine for the eyes.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient reported feeling better in regard to the blooded stools and was unsure if it was actually blood or not in her stools and she had ate spicy and red food.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, blooded stools, was considered resolved. The outcome for the events, eyes are a little bit itchy and right eye swollen was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 83-year-old female patient with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J00/NA), and who experienced the unlisted serious event of Haematochezia and the unlisted non-serious events of Eye pruritus and Eye swelling.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded making the events possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                Bad headache, very stuffy nose, I couldn&#39;t breathe and almost went to the hospital. Ears were ringing, my eyes were ready to pop out of my head. Temples hurt, lymph glands were swollen, sore throat. Mostly in upper part of anatomy above collar bone. It made me very weak, I had trouble getting out of rocking chair to answer phone. So I took another Tylenol. I usually only take 1-2 Tylenol a day and that was my second one by the middle of the day. I had to lay down and I live alone so I was nervous and had phone beside me and debated calling 911 which I have never done. I dozed and when I woke up about a couple of hours later it was much better. Still had headache and a little stuffiness but anybody can handle that. Also, I was very nauseated and couldn&#39;t eat but I did drink water.

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

She was eating breakfast after at home and complained to a neighbor that her teeth hurt and she was nauseated after eating. In the afternoon, she felt dizzy and had diarrhea accompanied with blood. Close to 9 PM, her son went to check on her. The patient was found on the floor--she was unresponsive and had purple lips. Her son called an ambulance and started chest compressions. The patient passed away at the hospital. The doctor has ordered an autopsy, and the results are pending.

She started getting a rash - started 7 days after 2nd dose of vaccine At last visit, we did testing for vasculitis after the rash looked more vasculitic to me; ANCA testing was positive, as was ANA.  - 17 days after 2nd vaccine She was given prednisone 20 mg taper over the last 8 days.  She is feeling much better in terms of her rash and swelling.   She is having surgery on the 29th for her BCC on the left eyelid. She is noticing blurred vision in both eyes since this all started and she is mentioning this to the eye doctor when she sees them. She says her head was fuzzy when this started and this is better but is still &#34;fuzzy sometimes&#34; Her renal function was normal.  Her CBC was mildly elevated WBC but otherwise normal.  She denies any breathing problems, blood in stools or blood in urine, or neurologic symptoms other than the fuzzy head.

By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

It could also be 012620A Received the vaccine and that night around 10 PM I started having chills and my body started shaking for about  1 1/2 hours.  The next morning, I had a dry mouth and vomiting with mucous  going down the back of my throat, low grade fever of 99.6F  loss of appetite and diarrhea which lasted about 17 hours.  My arm hurt and later it started itching.  A  rash formed around the injection site.  I went to Urgent Care.  They said I got an infection from the needle and gave me an antibiotic and told me to use a heating pad to stop the itch.  i got a blister on my arm which my son used a needle to puncture it and water came out.  Nothing helped so I went to my primary doctor,  Dr.  He said I was highly allergic to the vaccine and gave me a script for Prednisone  which I took for 7 days (start high with pills and then reduce amount     I think 3 of 10 mg )  he advised me not to take the second shot for the vaccine so I cancelled the appointment as the doctor said it would make me sicker.

They gave me a shot and three prednisone pills to take on a taper.

He then called her back in a couple of days and she told him that she was fine.  She saw the nurse at the facility who told her to call the eye doctor after the first vaccine, and this is exactly the same as the first vaccine.  Her eye doctor had started her on a 2nd glaucoma drop Ropressor, and then with the reaction told her to stop taking it.  Her eye is worse today than it was yesterday, and has been using cold packs which feel good to her eye.  Was also running a fever of 99.9 and felt achy.

Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
