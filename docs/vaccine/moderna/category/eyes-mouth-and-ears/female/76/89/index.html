Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

The EMT&#39;s came, checked my lungs, etc.  and talked me through the episode which lasted about 15 minutes.  Then the swelling subsided.  I suspect it had, because I had dermal fillers approximately a year ago.  I had no other adverse affects, except for tiredness that evening.  People should be warned about this because it is a frightening event.  I have never had an adverse reaction to a vaccine before.

Approximately 10 minutes later, patient noticed that lips and mouth began feeling numb and tingly.  Our regional MD was called and advised nurses to have epinephrine on standby and to notify EMS. Ambulance arrived approximately 15 minutes after patient alerted staff of reaction.

Upon arrival, EMS advised patient to take second Benadryl pill that she had in her pocket. EMS transported patient to local hospital. Called to check on patient 4 hours later, patient has made a full recovery and is resting at home. Patient states that she was given a steroid at the hospital and monitored for several hours before being sent home.

Pt was feeling much better and talking within ten minutes.  We stayed with the patient and monitored her continuously until her observation time was complete and when she left with family she was alert, oriented, and said she felt much better.  Instructed patient and her family to give us a call if they had any further questions or concerns and to go to the ER if any serious reaction symptoms occurred.

Hairstylist removed her mask and she then passed out.  Called 911.  They observed my mom sweating, her lips and hands were swollen, she was slack jawed, pale and clammy.   After several minutes she came out of it.  Was given a piece of candy thinking it was a sugar low, but her sugar was high 285 @9:00am.  Her color was still pale and she was still incoherent.  While still on with 911, she became more lucid and said she was feeling better, so ambulance was canceled.   I drove her home and checked her sugar @11:00 - 295 and BP 125/55 pulse 75.  She stayed with me for the rest of Saturday.  Her sugar was still high Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  Upon checking her blood sugar log, her sugar had gone up for a week following the first shot.

                                                The evening  of the first shot on February 5, I had a strong headache, muscle aches and was extremely tired for the next two days.  I had brain fog for the next 2 weeks.  Tylenol and Advil mostly relieved physical discomfort.    I had the second shot March 16.  The next day I had a severe headache, no energy, achy body,  chills and fever and on the second day after the shot my temperature was 101.4 - 101.8.  Tylenol and Advil relieved the symptoms.  Today, one week after the second shot I developed a pungent chemical taste in my mouth and a similar sense of smell.  The tip of my tongue is tingling, and while I can breathe in deeply,  my chest feels heavy, like I&#39;m not getting enough oxygen.

                                                I had a severe migraine - and I don&#39;t have headaches. My whole face hurt.  (I have two optic aneurisms and I was afraid they were starting to bleed out.) My eye was running water even more at that point and I also had some mucus in my eye. I went to ER.  January 8 and they did a CT scan - and they gave me something IV for pain. They told me to take extra strength Tylenol every four hours and that didn&#39;t help. After one hour, I was in severe pain again. At that point, both eyes were tearing. I went to the dentist (Monday)  -and they did x-rays - (  to see if I had a tooth issue and I went to my ENT doctor  (Tuesday)- and he said it didn&#39;t appear that I had a major infection.  still in severe pain - she gave me a prescription to get rid of infection in my eyes. She gave me a steroid shot - which stopped the pain. The following week, I had an appt with an ophthalmologist- I was not in pain any more and my eyes had pretty much cleared up. He said I probably had a viral or bacterial infection prior and when I got the vaccine then that was why I got a migraine.  2nd vaccine - 30th of January (8:30) - I slept all that day - I was sleepy the whole day and the Sunday, I had flu like symptoms and after that I was fine. This week, I have the infection in my eyes again. I went back to the Dr yesterday to get an antibiotic because I was having the same kind of infections. This time - infection in my left eye, with tearing and mucus. They had me do the eye drops again and nasal spray I&#39;ve been using.

                                                On approx. March 6th I noticed I was having a ringing in my ears. It has persisted since then, no better no worse.  It does not keep me up at night but it is annoying.  I don&#39;t know if it is related to the vaccine shot but I kept thinking that it could be a delayed reaction.  Maybe it started before but at a lower level and took until the 6th for me to notice. This week (week of March 22) I read a news article about someone who committed suicide because he was having severe bouts of tinitis since having had a case of covid.  That made me think that my tinitis could be related to the vaccine.  I tried to red up on tinitis and it seems that there is no treatment for this. Am I correct in that information?

(3/18 went to doctor ).  He thought I had fluid in my ears.  Put me on fluticasone Propionate Nasal spray, stopped meloxicam. Called Dr. and he put me on antibiotic (10 days) thinking I had ear infection. Still couldn&#39;t hear well. On 3/1 at 11:45 am had 2nd Moderna vaccine shot. By midnight I had fever, chills. 3/2 fever, chills am, very tired. 3/2 in the evening I thought I would watch tv.  I turned it on and the mouths were moving but I couldn&#39;t understand anything they were saying. 3/8 Went to ENT and had a hearing test. I still had tinnitus. Test results showed that I have a moderate to severe hearing loss in conversation area in both ears. 3/9 Went to ENT who prescribed prednisone beginning with 60 mg. 3/30 Had another hearing test at ENT. Test results showed no improvement, hearing still as on 3/8. So end results I have tinnitus all the time and a hearing loss that I did not have before taking the vaccine.

                                                On 03/20/21 a day after receiving 1st dose of Moderna, I woke up at around 8am with a dark bruise on the right outside corner of my bottom lip.  I checked it in the mirror and noticed a dark bruise inside the same area.  I also noticed some small boil like bumps on the same corner of my right bottom lip.  Also some sort of lesions inside of my mouth on the right cheek and inside the right side of the bottom lip and inside the bottom of the skin between my gums and bottom of bottom lip.  The next day 03/21/21 the bruises were gone, but the small bumps and lesions were still there and have been until the present.  I did not call my doctor or go to urgent care, because I got very sick to my stomach like stomach flu, and it takes forever to get through to make an appointment with the clinic and urgent care.  I was going to call for an appointment today,  but have had diahrrea  for the last week.  I also don&#39;t know what type of doctor to call for oral  type problems.  I was going to call my insurance company to ask them.  I have a great doctor, but I don&#39;t feel  like waiting on the phone to get through to my doctor or urgent care.  So haven&#39;t been seen by a doctor.

Usually I have a path of Z&#39;s going left to right and then at my age I had  a very slight headache. These looked different with broken up lights. and I woke up with them.Then on Feb 24  :1t 1:15 I had my second. The next morning I woke up with a hazy eyesight but I thought it might be a migraine. I somehow knew it wasn&#39;t but didn&#39;t go to a doctor. The next morning definitely knew.  Saw 2 doctors one in emergency situation he placed me on steroids but I had lost part of my eye sight.

                                                Within approximately 30 minutes post vaccination, the patient returned to the pharmacy stating her tongue was tingling and her chest felt very tight. She did not appear to be in any distress. Despite this we had epinephrine at the ready. At this time she offered that her last flu vaccine caused this kind of response but this time it was worse. When asked why she did not share this initially, she said, &#34; i didnt see a place on the sheet for it&#34;. Over the next 30 minutes her tongue tingling resolved, however her chest remained tight. Her tongue tingling then recurred, at this time I suggested she needed a more appropriate setting to be monitored. The patient agreed, we called 911 and EMTS transferred her to the local hospital.  At the time of transfer, the patient appeared stable without visible symptoms.

Approximately April 14, I experienced tinnitus and it has continued until this date.  I also had a hearing test and was told by the audiologist that I had a profound hearing loss.  Up to this point, I have never had an ear infection and had no problem with hearing.   I am reporting this event in case there are others and you may find the vaccine causes sudden hearing loss and/or tinnitus.

I felt dizzy and light headed and had fever of 101F, headache, body aches and I could not get out of bed. I had trouble sleeping. I had trouble concentrating, decrease cognitive abilities and extreme fatigue.  I did take an antihistamine (Xyzal) prior to the vaccine.  I took Tylenol and Zofran  for nausea.  The swelling subsided after  2 days,  and the acute-flu like symptoms lasted about a week. I usually see my doctor every week for weekly injection for my RA .  I still have nausea and he prescribed Zofran for that.   I have small-medium lost my appetite and my taste and smell have change and also itchy eye.  But I have noticed increased saliva excretion.

My cheeks are still a redder color than usual (my skin is light olive-toned( the second event(s) occurred April 23rd and again May 21st. My peripheral vision was obstructed by  shivering white rings with black lines. One of my eye doctors told me that they were ocular migraines. The first event lasted about one half to three quarters of an hour. The second event was 15 to 20 minutes.

                                                Within 15 mins after the vaccine, I felt weakness and weak in the knees and chills;  it didn&#39;t feel flu-like though. and within the first few hours I had &#34;Moderna arm&#34; - right near the injection site - big red splotch and the arm was sore. The redness in the arm lasted a good week. It was a red blotch but not itchy or swollen. I didn&#39;t feel well for a few days after the vaccine.  The symptoms came and went as far as how I felt - chills, weak, not feeling terrific for those first few days or so. A month after the second shot, I had a rash on my neck. It came and went - a little itchy and then not itchy. (This happened for a month.) And then at the same time, I felt the same original symptoms - chills and not feeling good. It lasted about three days - the chills and weakness. And then it went away. Even since, April, I get this periodically - I feel weak in the knees, I get the chills and I have to take a Tylenol or something. The middle of May, I was taking off my makeup and I felt a burning on my face (same stuff I&#39;ve been using for 20 years on my face) red splotch from  top of nose and all around and on cheekbones and down the face - it was puffy, swollen, red and caused bags under my eyes and redness under my eyes- and it still is. He gave me a cortisone lotion (my dermatologist) - It&#39;s not as red as it was but if I press on it the redness comes back. I have not changed anything with make-up; lotion or food. I have photos of it that I can send of my face. It&#39;s still here  - maybe not as bright - and I&#39;m not sure that I notice difference using the cortisone cream. It&#39;s been a good six weeks since it started on the face.

Vision was clear but eyes felt strange.  I looked at eyes when I got home but did not see anything other redness.  Next morning my eyes were very red and had seepage as if conjunctivitis.  I have had allergic conjunctivitis for years in spring or fall.  Two days later I could see my eyelids were swollen, inside eyes very red, scratchy feeling.  Today the sixth day and eyes no longer feel swollen but very irritated.  I am using refresh tears and Claritin 10mg.

                                                I awoke on 1/23/2021 (Saturday) morning to find my face and especially my lips swollen.  Contacted doctor&#39;s office for the on-call; he strongly suggested I visit the ER. Was kept there for 2-3 hours for observation.  Was considered &#34;hypertensive,&#34;  routine blood work done (CBC, metabolic panel) all of which were normal.  Was given Prednisone and ZyrTec.   After no change in my condition, was discharged with instruction to contact primary physician and continue to take Prednisone and ZyrTec for the next four more days.   The reason for the facial and lip swelling could not be determined......It was indicated that the swelling could be one of several things including an allergic reaction to something topical like a lip balm (I used a Blistix application before bed), a reaction to one of my medication (BP med-Olmesartan, which they told me to discontinue) or less likely a reaction to the COVID vaccine.

Numbness in the right side of the lips three days after the vaccination.  The numbness frightened me as I feared a TIA or return of Bell&#39;s palsy.  Went to ER on Feb .7 when the numbness happened.  Was examined by ER physicians, Blood work was completed, CAT scan done, cursory stroke exam completed by a PA and resident.  No diagnosis was made except for adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine.  I had had COVID symptoms beginning on or about November 30, 2020.  Was not treated by a doctor at that time.  Just seemed like having a common cold.  Have never before had any adverse reaction to any vaccination.

                                                I developed all the symptoms of Covid, except fever. The cough was the worst. Had taste, but it is still off; nothing tastes right. I had a Covid test on 01/24/2021 that came back negative. I had two more tests in the hospital on 2/9/2021 that also came back negative. I went to hospital on doctor&#39;s orders due to some blurry vision and concern about blood clots, which I did not have. Symptoms persisted until 2/12/2021.

                                                2 days after vaccination I noticed that I had a blood red bruise just under my left eye, close to nostril; I noticed blood in left nostril on 3rd day, and that evening noticed that I had redness in corner of my left eye with a red spot in very corner, which led me to reporting it here. I have not yet had contact with my doctor, but plan to call him and/or ophthalmologist tomorrow, Monday.

After 48 hours the feeling did not subside so I made an appointment to visit my oral surgeon.  On 02/04/2021 I visited my oral surgeon who took  multiple pictutes of my mouth/palate and felt it was a reaction to the vaccine.  She prescribed a mouthwash as treatment and a follow up in 2 weeks.

                                                Sudden dizziness with some nausea and cold drenching sweat - no fever - extremely weak and fatigued and could barely stand and then severe headache came on about 10 minutes into episode.  Dizziness lasted approximately 2 hours until I could safely move and then began to subside.  I noticed my eyes did not want to focus well and was seeing spots when I tried writing down what happened.  Chills began and I felt extremely cold, my head felt &#34;foggy&#34; and tight, ringing in ears started and headache moved to migraine level.  Slight fever 99.8. Main dizziness did pass after about 2 hours but other things continue to linger on an off.  I just feel &#34;off&#34;.  I have actually heard other seniors mention some of these very symptoms so am not super alarmed, however, I did not have any of these side effects before the vaccine for Covid-19.  I did experience extreme fatigue and bad headaches since I received the first dose on January 27, 2021.    I have not called my doctor regarding these side effects since I have heard many seniors complain of very similar reactions.  I have rested as much as possible, tried to stay hydrated, and taken Tylenol when needed.  For the dizziness I tried to stay as still as possible and put my head between my knees until it finally passed.

Then, about a minute later, I experienced a second episode that was less intense. About a week later, I had another quick pain behind my left eye. I had no vision changes or any other symptoms afterwards.

The tinnitus has continued, about 4-5 days per week.  I have seen my ENT  twice.  He suggested I try melatonin.

                                                Mom became agitated. Would not sleep. Stayed continuously awake for approximately 40 hours.  Could not be redirected. So tired she was swaying on her feet, but could not be convinced to lay down.  After 2 days we were able to get 50 mg Trazadone from our doctor.  After sleeping for 6-8 hours she then did another 24 hours awake. We upped the dose to 100 mg.  By this point the event had started to pass.    During this time we also noticed mom was running a low fever in the morning. 99.5 - 100.5. It would go away in the afternoon.  During this time mom was hallucinating - having conversations with people who were not there.  Mom&#39;s hearing declined during the event as well.   As of 2 days ago mom&#39;s temperature seems to be back to normal in the morning.  This &#34;event&#34; has impacted mom&#39;s mental and physical decline.  She seemingly overnight now needs help showering and toileting, and sometimes dressing.  (This kind of decline is common for dementia.  Each time over the past 5 years that mom has had some physically stressful even such as hurting her foot or getting a bad stomach virus,  she has come out the other side degraded)  The reason I&#39;m reporting this is that the behavior changes were sudden, seemed to peak, and then subside.  There is a correlation with the second moderna shot, and so I though it was important to report.

                                                She got moderna vaccine at 9:30 AM.  She started to get itchy lips and fuzzy tongue shortly after immunization given. This is a similar reaction as when she has had carbocaine and novacaine. She is having no breathing issues. No facial swelling. She got benadryll at 10:04 AM.  She notes that has helped - the burning in her throat is better now after the benadryl. She is currently feeling like she still something in her throat, wants to clear it. Were better then throat scratchiness occurred and same throat burning and foreign body feeling returned. Epi pen given in office and patient was sent to the ER. Her vitals were stable and she had her son here who felt comfortable transporting her to the ER.

I was blind in that eye for about 10 minutes. We drove  right away to my eye doctor, who sent me to the ER. The hospital is Stroke Certified. They admitted me and did a stroke workup. I was in the hospital for 1 day (24 hours) which included overnight.  The treating HCP concluded that I had experienced an ocular stroke. Since it was exactly 4 days after my second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, it most likely was caused by that vaccine.

                                                I had my first Moderna vaccine on February 13, and about 20 minutes later my tongue began to feel like novocaine wearing off. This lasted about two hours, and then I had no further reactions . My second shot was on March 13, and the same thing happened., tongue tingling, lasting 2 hours, then no further problems. On March 29 I woke up with lesions under my tongue, and a brief time of having difficulty moving my tongue. During the day my tongue felt strange and the lesions hurt. Since the 29th the lesions have disappeared, and each day my tongue improved.  Today, April 23, I would describe my tongue as feeling like I have burned it on something hot, uncomfortable but not painful.

Then they were very dry around the outside of the lips and the center of the lips that touch was sticky. When you smile, you feel as if your lips are going to split.  This has lasted for two months and is still continuing. I am using a steroid cream twice a day on my lips. Using a combination of coconut oil and lavender essential oil in between to keep my lips soft. This has helped but it seems as if it gets worse if I stop treatment.

                                                Pt called about a month after her second dose. She had been to the dentist and was asked why her tongue was white, splotchy, and had blisters. She also had a bitter taste in her mouth. Pt noticed some soreness while brushing her teeth before going to the dentist that day, but nothing previously. Pt was not sure if it was from the vaccination.

                                                She got her vaccine, about a day and a half her arm was sore and itchy.  Then later on it was red, splotchy kind of redness, but not at the point of the injection, just a couple of inches below towards the elbow.  This lasted for about a week.  The soreness went away but could see redness in the area, which took about 4 weeks for this to disappear completely.  She had a headache which lasted for a short period of time, and disappeared.  She also had a swollen lymph node along her waste that were sore about 2 days after the vaccine, which also disappeared and had it only for a day or two.   She started noticing a sound, thinking it was in her old house the 2nd week of April, but moved to a quieter neighborhood and still noticed it.  She was reading an article this morning in the paper and realized the sound that she was hearing was tinnitus.  She was only born with one ear and it sounds more like a beeping sound than a ringing, but it continues to bother her.  She does not notice it when she&#39;s out driving around from the other noises in the environment but when it&#39;s quiet due to the one ear she can hear it.  With only one ear she cannot determine the direction of where the sound is coming from, but does notice it during quietness.  She puts her ear up to the wall to determine where the sound is coming from and plugged her ear, and determine it was from the ear itself.     She is worried about it getting worse or not getting any better with only having the one ear.

I did not have any energy and couldn&#39;t concentrate since the pains were happening all the time. My doctor treated me with Valtrex and a topical pain killer (Lidocaine). I was diagnosed with Shingles but did not break out. It took about a month to recover from the Shingles and then my ear continued to hurt for another two to three weeks. Now, everything seems to be fine.

I had pain in my shoulder and going up the side of my bed. It wrapped around my head and behind my eye. I had had shingles before and it felt like shingles pain. I noticed I was breaking out on my shoulder and starting up the side of my neck. I went to the urgent care and they diagnosed me with shingles. They gave me some medicine and it went away 2 weeks later. It didn&#39;t affect my eye itself, but it did affect my eyelid and around my eye. I saw my regular doctor later on. I just had a prescheduled appointment with her. I did tell her about it. She looked at the area and said I was healing up nicely. She suggested I get the shingles vaccine.

On 1/19/2021 the pt reported she could not speak with me (RN) further as she was about to go on a zoom meeting with her allergist to discuss the event. RN asked pt to call the LHD back.  1/20/2021 RN called pt to discuss further, pt stated she is in the grocery store and cannot speak. RN asked pt what the allergist recommended. Pt stated the allergist recommended getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine however with additional pre-medications. Pt stated she could not speak with RN further and would call me back.  1/25/2021 - pt did not call clinic back. RN called pt to get more details on the event. Pt reported her allergist would like her to get the 2nd injection in the hospital, while taking Singulair the night before and Zyrtec and Benadryl the day of. RN advised the pt her allergic reaction is a contraindication to receiving the 2nd dose per CDC guidelines. Pt verbalized understanding and will discuss with her allergist further.  Pt also mentioned possible allergy to Polysorbate during call on 1/25/2021 however she reports because she tolerates Miralax on a regular basis her allergist does not believe it to be a true allergy. Pt did not mention this in VAMS. I was not the vaccinator.

Her lips did not appear swollen, she had no shortness of breath, no rash or hives.  The patient has a prior history of allergic reactions to shrimp and other injectables (not specified).    Per the patient, by the time I spoke with her, her symptoms were already resolving.  Her vital signs were recorded and reported to Doctor on duty.  Instructions were received to continue monitoring the patient and she could be discharged when her symptoms were completely resolved.  After an additional 20 minutes, per the patient, her symptoms were all gone and &#34;felt fine&#34;.  The patient was discharged to home.  Patient left the clinic by wheelchair accompanied by her family member.  She was instructed to call 911 if her symptoms worsened and/or contact her primary physician.  The patient was asymptomatic upon discharge.

On the way to theER my eye felt like it had sand in it and I had to hold my hand over it and my mouth and lips felt like I had a shot of novicane and it was hard to pronounce certain words. I have  to eat small things because it is difficult puttinng food in my mouth and I can not feel the food in my mouth on the right side and if food gets over there it gets  between my gums and my cheek,  to drink I  have to position a straw in my mouth on a certain point  and some goes back down in the straw.

                                                My lips started to swell and got very red on Day #5.  I started applying vaseline.  By day #7, I called my dr who wasn&#39;t in and spoke to his associate. She said if it got worse to follow up with my dr. They continued to get worse and by Day #9, I called my doctor and sent him a photo. He told me to take benedryl and an antihistamine (zyrtec).  By the next day, the lips were worse, sent another photo and he prescribed Prednisone 20 mg for 5 days. I had a lot of trouble eating and drinking. My lips also felt like pins were constantly being stuck in them. The prednisone helped but it took at least another week before my lips returned to normal. On the advice of my doctor, I did not get the second Moderna dose.

She then had  tenderness in her mouth, used warm salty water which seems to be helping.  She cannot eat any hard food on it due to the discomfort.  She has continued nausea in the evenings.  No problems with the arm where she got the vaccine.  She feels it it getting some better, but the dizziness and nausea is the worst issue.  She did call her doctor and they told her that they could not give her anything for the rash in her mouth, and the chills. They told her that it had to run it&#39;s course.

With the second shot, I experienced chills; was clammy at the same time as the chills; very fatigued and could not stay awake; my muscles, joints and my whole body ached; headache; sinus infection (for which I am currently on an antibiotic); nausea; loss of appetite (lost 5 pounds); loss of taste and smell for 2-3 days.  Too weak to make it to the bathroom by myself.  I felt like I was in a delirium but my husband said that I was not incoherent.  Appetite is still not normal.  Mouth was so dry that I was not able to feel any moisture at all which I feel led to my sinus infection.

Along with weakness, extraordinary &#34;brain fog&#34;, vertigo, loud tinnitus (buzzing). 2 1/2 weeks in I found an elliptical itching rash at the vaccine site.   almost a month later I&#39;m still suffering from dizziness, brain fog, and exhaustion.  2nd dose due 26th March and I&#39;m scared to proceed.

However, a few weeks later the patient acutely developed shingles (as determined by her primary care provider). Symptoms experienced: numbness in the mouth and tongue, red, enlarged bumps at the tip of the tongue, itchy skin and bumps in the skin surrounding the mouth, pain in and behind the left ear, tiredness, drowsiness. The symptoms developed all within the same day and still persist at the writing of this report. The doctor does not know if this was a result of the vaccine, but says we should not discard the possibility. The patient did have varicella in her youth

Nausea started that morning and increased in intensity associated with dry mouth.  The nausea was constant.  I couldn&#39;t stand the smell of food.  I drank lots of water, forced myself to eat some crackers, lay on the sofa all day for several days.  On 3/29 I started taking Omeprazole.  On 4/3 my nausea started improving and by 4/5 was gone.

The following week she lost her taste, and ever since she has cold chills constantly, is weak, cannot do anything.  She is light headed, her vision is sometimes blurred and will not go away.  She has been taking Tylenol for fever.  She went to the ER because it was so bad, and they did a CT scan, EKG, chest x-ray for pneumonia, and did blood work.  They could not find anything wrong with her.  She has also been to her doctor who checked her over and could not find anything wrong either.

Nothing helped (Benadryl, etc.) The next day I started to have constant ringing &amp; humming in both ears. It  has not subsided at all &amp; I am struggling to hear people talk to me now, at least 15-20% hearing loss. One of the worst experiences of my life &amp; am so sorry I got the shot.  I have NEVER gotten a flu shot that is recommended every year, &amp; I NEVER GET THE FLU.  MY DOCTOR TOLD ME I HAVE A HIGH TOLERANCE FOR WHATEVER STRAIN IS GOING AROUND.  I wish I could turn back time - I would never agreed to get the Moderna - now I am doomed for life with a hearing disability &amp; Tinnituus.  I now read all the reports &amp; learn that Moderna vaccine was not tested (even it had been - it wouldn&#39;t have passed.)  For sure I will not get 2nd Booster shot - or any other vaccine that comes along.    Someone told me that they had such sever itching that they had to go to Urgent Care for medical treatment on legs because they stratched so much they could stop the bleeding! NEVER AGAIN!

                                                On the 19th of March, one day after the two week period after the second shot, my heart began to race and my breathing became difficult. My husband took me to the ER and at that time the doctors were unable to find the problem. After several ER visits, visit with neuro due to a nerve problem that came along with the heart and breathing problems , my primary care doctor finally suggested an ultra sound be conducted due to the extreme leg/thigh pain that had made it impossible for me to walk. The results of the ultra sound indicated severe extreme multiple blood clots.  At this point, I had become wheel chair bound. The nerve injury was pinching on the optcitical nerve which has now caused my vision to be impaired; my vision is no longer sharp (blurred vision). At this point, I can only walk a few feet without the assistance of a wheel chair or some other support. My thighs remain huge/swolllen. I continue experience leg/thigh pain. The nerve injury in the left side of my brain seems to be causing some crippling of my right hand which is my dominant side.

                                                24 hours after vaccination, my entire body head to toes became violently itchy - with bright red welts wherever I scratched. On the 2nd day after I noticed a loud hissing sound in both ears. It has now been 60 days with NO RELIEF! I have undergone comprehensive hearing exam which shows hearing loss &amp;  Tinnitus. Both are now permanent.  There is no treatment and the outcome is bleak:  Loss of hearing, constant hissing in ears and extreme sensitivity to touch - skin turns to bright red welts if scratched at all &amp; welts last about 20 minutes. All body parts head to toe.

Day 2: Vision and breathing now normal. Numbness and tingling of tongue has lessened. Body aches and pain more prominent. * Please note that this mobile clinic that came to my mom&#39;s home was not set up for a serious reaction, nor did they stay and wait at least 15 minutes. My mom was told that she would have flu like symptoms and then they left.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

Her cheeks were swollen, she felt that maybe her tongue was as well.  She got the liquid Benadryl and let it stay there and it helps that feeling.  She had taken the Zyrtec and Singulair the night before.  She did the inhaler puff in the morning, the feeling did not go away.  She then took the Ventolin and it seemed to calm down.   The symptoms then went away and didn&#39;t come back, and thought that she was ok.   She felt bad for about a week and a half like she wanted to sleep all the time, but did what she had to do.  She is fine now.

I ALSO FELT A COLD SORE COMING ON.  I TOOK SUDAFED PE AND VALCYCLOVIR, WHICH USUALLY SOLVES THE ISSUE.  THESE SYSMPTOMS CONTINUED AND I CONTINUED WITH SUDAFED AND VALCYCLOVIR.  I SAW MY DENTIST ON FEBRUARY 11 AND WAS TOLD THERE THERE WERE NO ISSUES AND PERHAPS THE PAIN WAS CAUSED BY SINUS ISSUES.  I INCREASED THE VALCYCLOVIR TO THREE TABS A DAY RATHER THAN ONE.  THE TEETH ISSUE SPREAD TO THE LEFT SIDE OF MY  MOUTH AND  TWO MORE COLD SORES APPEARED, ANOTHER ON MY UPPER LIP AND ONE AT THE EDGE OF MY LEFT NOSTRIL.  I HAD A ZOOM MEETING WITH MY DOCTOR ON MARCH 1.  SHE INCREASED THE VALCYCLOVIR TO 1000M. THREE TIMES A DAY.  THE COLD SORES HAVE DISAPPEARED, BUT THE OTHER SYMPTOMS CONTINUE, BUT THE PAIN HAS LESSENED SOMEWHAT.  I TAKE TYLENOL WHEN THE DISCOMFORT BEGINS TO INTERFERE WITH MY DAILY LIFE.

She was cultured for infection and everything came back negative. She was treated initially with antibiotics and anti-viral medication and did not start to improve until was started on frequent topical and oral steroids. She has still lost most of her vision but the inflammation is improving within the anterior chamber but her cornea is still opacified. She has a history of shingles that affected this eye but it had been quiet and she does not seem to be responding to anti viral medication.

Her tongue is real sore and feels as if she burnt her tongue.  The top of her gums in her mouth were all red and hurting as well.  She got real nervous and antsy.  She had this for a few days, then about 4 days later called the doctor and went to the clinic and she has canker sores in her mouth.  They told her they would probably go away in a week or two, and it was 2 weeks  yesterday from her vaccine.  They have gotten better but they are not totally gone, and her mouth still does not feel right, but does not feel as bad as it did, does not feel normal.  The tip still feels like she burnt it.  He wants to check her again around the 17th, did not give her any treatment for it.  The pharmacy wants her to recheck with her doctor in regard to getting the 2nd vaccine or not, or to get it at a doctors office to watch her more closely.

                                                The patient stated that she gets paralyzed after getting vaccines.  I asked her if she had someone in the pharmacy to help her. She said she came alone.  I told her I would have her wait 30mins after dose to make sure there were no issues. After I gave her the shot, she looked at me and said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. Then she looked and said my neck hurts. So I had her take deep breaths with me to get her to calm down as she appeared anxious. She was doing great then she went limp. I held her head up and asked her is she was ok.   She said she was, but then her breathing become shallow. She was un responsive at this time with her tongue pushing her mask off her mouth.  So I lowered her mask and her tongue appeared to be enlarged.  I had my technician call 911 and I gave her a dose of epinephrine 0.3 mg.   She was unresponsive, but breathing on her own.  The paramedics came and got her vitals, placed her on stretcher, and put in a medicine line to give her medications if need be.  She left somewhat unresponsive. They said she should be fine  and took her to ER.

After 15 minutes, I left the pharmacy, could drive my car and felt only slight dizziness.  However, the tongue and lips continued to feel burning/prickly for the rest of the day.  I did not  report this to the pharmacy.  If the 2nd shot does this again, I will report it to them.

The patient&#39;s medical history as reported by the reporter includes hypertensive, diabetic and had circulation problems. Concomitant medications taken by the patient was not provided.  On 25 Feb2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025A21A) through intramuscular route at unspecified site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unknown date, patient had dizziness, tiredness (which is very unusual for patient), slurred speech numbness and blurred vision and then patient was taken to the ER and diagnosed with having stroke. She was admitted and discharged when her condition improved. As per the follow up report received, the reporter reported that patient ended up in having a stroke which was a medically significant event and she was very very lethargic and had dizziness, felt numbness and tingling in face and fingers. Patient had also  lost speech, lost eyesight which was a medically significant event. Patient went to the hospital where she was diagnosed. Patient was feeling better at the time of reporting and mostly recovered but feeling weak.  Patient went to hospital and treatment activities for events was unknown.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of events, experienced dizziness, tiredness, slurred speech, numbness, blurred vision, stroke, very very lethargic and had tingling in face and fingers was recovering/resoving and lost speech, lost eyesight  was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: There is not enough information to assess the causal association between the reported events and the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.  Critical details such as the onset date of the event is lacking.  Event is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age and underlying medical conditions of hypertensive, diabetic and had circulation problems.

                                                The morning after I woke up and got out of bed and I was extremely dizzy to the point that I went downstairs on my seat (bottom) so I could go down. I then stayed on the couch and called for  help. My tongue swelled up and filled my mouth. My neck glands were swelling and my  hands itched and they were red (no welts) like crazy. I took  Benadryl and it eased up and I went back to bed. The next morning that was gone. I have had another allergic reaction since then and this time I thought I was getting shingles - my throat got very very red, ears itched and my hands itched and I had ropey welts where my bra sat. My whole stomach area was very itchy. I called the doctor  (after hours phone call - on the 31st) - and she assured me that I wasn&#39;t getting shingles as I already have had them twice. I took  Benadryl and then the doctor prescribed a non-drowsy antihistamine  - Claritin - and I am taking that every day. I am not someone that has allergic stuff occur. These took it down and I haven&#39;t had it again.

Seen same day in ophthalmology clinic, diagnosed with optic nerve ischemia, likely GCA, Rx&#39;d 80mg PO prednisone, lab evaluation started which revealed elevated CRP. This, in combination new new grey &#39;veil&#39; over vision of L eye the next day 4/21/21, led to admission and initiation of 1,000mg daily IV methylprednisolone. Unfortunately pt then progressed to complete painless loss of vision of left eye as well on 4/23/21 while inpatient on high dose steroids. Patient is now completely blind in both eyes.

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 80-year-old, female patient who suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia).                                                                                                                      The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Then, about 5 weeks, developed headaches, ear aches and achiness in neck and lower skull.  Then about 6 weeks later (3/29/21) got dizzy and felt no energy, still had headaches, slight ear aches and achiness in neck and lower skull.  Lasted about 3 days but seems to be better (took Meclazine starting on 3/30.    This all concerned me until I saw my chiropractor today (3/31) and he told me 2 of his patients had dizziness too.  They took Benedryl and that helped immensely.  They told him that they looked it up and dizziness can be a an adverse reaction to the Covid vaccs.  I looked it up on FB and saw that dizziness can be a reaction although the timeline for it to happen varied greatly - from immediately after to 3 weeks after.  In my case it&#39;s about 6 weeks after.  Felt ok in between the vacc #2 and first reaction of sore arm.  5 weeks after til next reaction of achy neck, skull and earaches.  6 weeks after Vacc # 2  til dizziness.

Went to Urgent care and was givenMeclizine 12.5mg and Ondansetron 4mg.  Dizziness and nausea lessened over the next 3 days.   Went to ENT doctor - Hearing  test on 3/29/21 revealed total loss of hearing in right ear.  Hearing in left ear was diminished before vaccination and that was about the same after the vaccination.  ENT injected steriod into right ear on 3/31/21.  Second steriod injection on 4/2/21.  No improvement in hearing so far. Dizziness continues off and on.  Still unstable and needs to use a walker.

                                                The following day I had a fever of 102 and was achy. In February, I developed a horrendous ringing in my ear. I went to the doctor and my BP was high, but the ringing persisted even when it was regulated. I was sent to an ENT and was told that tinnitus is usually a nerve issue. Initially, I didn&#39;t think it had anything to do with the vaccine until my neighbor told me about her experience. She said that there isn&#39;t any treatment for it, so I&#39;m still dealing with the ringing.

                                                She got her 2nd vaccine, they kept her 30 minutes as she had problems with the 1st one, her BP was okay and that she could drive home and was told to drink a lot of water.  She went home and after every bottle of water she had 3-4 episodes of diarrhea and kept drinking water all day and after 3-4 she did not have any more diarrhea.   She had some pain in her arm.   She started having visions of chicken scratches/white lines across her eyebrows from the left to the right across her whole forehead.    She always has this vision discrepancy all day long inside the house and outside when she goes and gets the mail.  She first went to the eye doctor as she was having floaters, white lines visually appearing but have not had them for a long time, and these did not go away and they were not the usual floaters like she had before.  They got her in the office immediately and that doctor said that he did not have an answer for her and he didn&#39;t find anything wrong with her eyes.   She told him that she was worried about what happened after the vaccine.    She went to her PCP and she ended up in the hospital as she has a problem with her left rotator cuff and needs surgery on that but is waiting for her leg to heal from total knee surgery.   When she lays down at night she has chest pains, and didn&#39;t know what it was and was told that there is a nerve that runs down from the shoulder and crosses over to the heart and gives the feeling of chest pains.  She had tests done and they did not give her any answers to what the pains were.   She then went to her PCP again and told her about the vision issues and she didn&#39;t have an answer to her issues either.  Her daughter suggested that perhaps her BP was an issue and she brought that to her attention and she told her to document it and to FU this week with her nurse to see that everything was working okay.  She states that her BP has never been the same, she has never had a BP problem before.  She takes it every morning between 9-10 AM.  131/86, 139/80, at 5:00 132/74, 148/88, 133/84, 139/92, yesterday was 137/83, today 132/84.   She has been placed on BP medicine, Cardizem 30 mg.

                                                As far as I know, I was sitting after dinner reading and I was aware that I could not see well out of my right out, it was very blurry and at the very same time though I had a very sharp pain in the left occipital region. So I was most worried about my eye because I know something was wrong. First thing in the morning I called my eye DR and she told me that I had a right side occlusion in my right eye. So then what she had me do was wait a couple weeks to see if it would go away spontaneously and it didn&#39;t. So I went to a retinal specialist and they gave me shots in that eye because I could still not see out of my eye. It has not completely cleared but it is much better. I also had a severe pain in my neck and brain. I went to the ER and the DR that evaluated me there didn&#39;t know what my diagnosis was at the time but he put me on some medications that he thought would help with the inflammation. So he put me on cortisone and gave me a prescription for valacyclovir, because I have a history of herpes infections all over my body. SO that was on the Sunday that I went to the ER. Then by Wednesday the pain was so severe that I went to the ER at the hospital because I was so uncomfortable and worried. At the end of five weeks it just went away. I did see a neurologist but it was over by then, he said the diagnosis was occipital issues.

Saw the doctor who gaver her an injection (forget the name) and the predsolone med pack.  The swelling started to go down 2 days after taking this medication. A week after taking the Moderna vaccine and taking this medication her swelling was gone. Medication was started on Wed Jan 21,2012 and completed on Tue Jan 26, 2021. The swelling didn&#39;t get life threatening but when we noticed that inflamation was worsening and Benadryl didnt work we worried and she went to see the doctor for the treatment described above.

When we were going home they told me I was swerving, all over the road and they told me to stop, they would drive, I said no, i don&#39;t trust anyone with my car. We got home, I remember changing into my nightgown and was texting someone and I suddenly I stopped. After that I was unresponsive. I would not answer anyone, they said I looked pale and stared into the air. They called my children and they came and emergency personnel was called. I was taken to a hospital and they transferred me to another hospital. I stayed there for 3-4 days. After going home it took me some days to be able to walk without assistance. I wanted to say I had covid in May (1st time) and September (2nd time) . I still do not have taste or smell back from the covid. I can only eat 3 or 4 bites and then I am done.

Then the ringing in her ears started within a week after that.  She does have tinnitus but it intensified since the vaccine.  She had a teleconference call with her doctor who told her that it was not one of the symptoms of the vaccine and told her to have her hearing checked.

On June 3 I experienced an event like no other.  My legs felt like rubber and  tried but could not speak.  My husband carried me to the sofa, when I sat down I felt disoriented, and saw a circle in front of my eyes.  I felt as if I was about to pass out.  I saw my cardiologist a week later.  He is concerned that the neurological symptoms are new.  He suspects I had a mini stroke despite being on blood thinner for my CHF and referred me to a neurologist.  He suggested I report this sudden change to VAERS.

                                                Seizure like episode on 1/12/21, one week after vaccine, last 1.5 hours, consisting of both eyes twitching and clenching/spasm of right hand and arm.  EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

                                                Called at 8 am this morning to inform me of a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She received the vaccine on Tuesday, 1/19/21. The next day she noted the back of her tongue on the R side was swollen. On Thurs, 1/21/21, she reports she woke up with the back of her tongue swollen on both sides such that she had some trouble speaking and needed to be very careful with chewing so she would not bite her tongue. She stated she also had drippy sinuses and an earache which then woke her up several times during the night last night. Today she reports the tongue swelling is only to the back R side of her tongue. She continues to have ear pain. She states she had not reported the symptoms to anyone before her call because she had not felt the symptoms were life-threatening. I asked her if she had taken any benedryl, and she stated the only medication she had taken was her analgesic herbal supplement. She states she has never had a vaccination reaction in the past. I advised her to call her PCP and be seen, which she was able to do. After she was seen, she called and stated while the clinician was looking at her tongue, it started to have shooting pains when she moved it to the right. The clinician stated her tongue and throat were not visibly swollen, noted no swollen lymph nodes, and noted no ear abnormalities.

I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

Then she called her brother who is a doctor and he told her to go to Cardiologist and get in. She was talking normal by the time she talked to him.  Adverse reaction was TIA.    TIA symptoms lasted 5-10 minutes max per patient.

I googled search and found it was a rare but real reaction vaccine, called COVID ARM. According to the information I read it occurs between 7-9 days after vaccination. Mine occurred exactly 7 days later. I have been putting Hydrocortisone cream with Aloe in it and on it. Today it is more sore then itching and still red. The Hydrocortisone with Aloe seemed to help.   I have also noticed my eyes have been watering a lot more since receiving the vaccine.

Now on 2/26/21 it still hurts however it is better, there is a slight swelling at the bottom of my right ear. The bone.( It seems) Question is:  is this a known reaction? About 10 minutes following the vaccine my upper left lip became numb ,but only a few seconds then disappeared.

                                                I had no effect until  after i went to sleep.. After midnight i awoke to itching all over. By morning my eyes were closed to slits and beneath my eyes were  bags as large as teabags, i also had a low grade fever, aches and pains and extreme fatigue. This lasted for a while so ,on Feb 2.. I went to the doctor who gave me a steroid shot. On the 4th  i was not as  achy though still tired and the bags under my eyes persisted ...My eyes were  still itchy and almost closed... She gave me another steroid shot.. i was also advised not to get second steroid shot by several doctors, a doctor and a Immunologist.. also advised against getting second dose. The fatigue remains and the swelling under eyes remains though not as pronounced as it was at first. I would like to be safe. Is the johnson and johnson an option for me? I would not like after effects Please get back to me with some suggestions and advice as to my being fully safe. thank you.

                                                The patient received her FIRST dose of Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/26/21 and SECOND dose on 2/23/21. On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS. I was not able to reach the patient in her hospital room today to get additional specifics about where she got the vaccine, its lot number etc., however she is a retired and has indicated her willingness to provide you with any and all additional information you need, and I am also personally very willing to provide any additional information about her eventual outcome.

On 04 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J00/NA) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the evening of 04 Jan 2021, the patient experienced blooded stools, eyes are a little bit itchy, and right eye swollen. The patient reported having blooded stools that were not diarrhea, but had occurred three or four times. Treatment for the events included non specified allergy medicine for the eyes.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient reported feeling better in regard to the blooded stools and was unsure if it was actually blood or not in her stools and she had ate spicy and red food.

The outcome for the events, eyes are a little bit itchy and right eye swollen was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 83-year-old female patient with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J00/NA), and who experienced the unlisted serious event of Haematochezia and the unlisted non-serious events of Eye pruritus and Eye swelling.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded making the events possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                Bad headache, very stuffy nose, I couldn&#39;t breathe and almost went to the hospital. Ears were ringing, my eyes were ready to pop out of my head. Temples hurt, lymph glands were swollen, sore throat. Mostly in upper part of anatomy above collar bone. It made me very weak, I had trouble getting out of rocking chair to answer phone. So I took another Tylenol. I usually only take 1-2 Tylenol a day and that was my second one by the middle of the day. I had to lay down and I live alone so I was nervous and had phone beside me and debated calling 911 which I have never done. I dozed and when I woke up about a couple of hours later it was much better. Still had headache and a little stuffiness but anybody can handle that. Also, I was very nauseated and couldn&#39;t eat but I did drink water.

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

                                                She awakened in the middle of the night feeling much pain in arm where injection was. Felt like she would throw up but couldn&#39;t move from the bed. Felt like her face was drawn and tight. This morning, she has been very shaky, sounds like some congestion in her chest (cough), very tired, very dry mouth. She is never sick, so this is alarming to her and to me.

By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

It could also be 012620A Received the vaccine and that night around 10 PM I started having chills and my body started shaking for about  1 1/2 hours.  The next morning, I had a dry mouth and vomiting with mucous  going down the back of my throat, low grade fever of 99.6F  loss of appetite and diarrhea which lasted about 17 hours.  My arm hurt and later it started itching.  A  rash formed around the injection site.  I went to Urgent Care.  They said I got an infection from the needle and gave me an antibiotic and told me to use a heating pad to stop the itch.  i got a blister on my arm which my son used a needle to puncture it and water came out.  Nothing helped so I went to my primary doctor,  Dr.  He said I was highly allergic to the vaccine and gave me a script for Prednisone  which I took for 7 days (start high with pills and then reduce amount     I think 3 of 10 mg )  he advised me not to take the second shot for the vaccine so I cancelled the appointment as the doctor said it would make me sicker.

He then called her back in a couple of days and she told him that she was fine.  She saw the nurse at the facility who told her to call the eye doctor after the first vaccine, and this is exactly the same as the first vaccine.  Her eye doctor had started her on a 2nd glaucoma drop Ropressor, and then with the reaction told her to stop taking it.  Her eye is worse today than it was yesterday, and has been using cold packs which feel good to her eye.  Was also running a fever of 99.9 and felt achy.

She did not have any reaction at all until she woke up 13 days later on 3/5/2021 and her left eye was blind.  She had some sort of blob that changes colors and moves around.  It sometimes is orange.  She knew she did not have macular degeneration as it centers it.  Sometimes it sparkles and has grain to it.  He said that she had an arterial blood, and that leaked from the carotid artery into the eye has not completely sealed off.  She can see out of the right eye perfectly, but she cannot see a little out of the left eye.  If she&#39;s watching the TV she can see the top of the newscasters hair, but she cannot see anything below that.  Her vision is upward either, can see out of either side, but cannot below horizontal down.  He told her that it was basically a stroke that didn&#39;t reach her brain and went to her eye.  He told her to return to see him (ophthalmologist) on 5/18/21 at 10:00 AM.  She also is to see her PCP on 5/20/21.

                                                This was the 2nd Moderna Shot on 2-18-2021.  She received the first shot on 1-22-2021. Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
