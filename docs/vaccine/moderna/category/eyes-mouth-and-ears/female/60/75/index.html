Area of tongue affected increased each day until today entire tongue is burning. Fissures are present, but no white coating. Today, two separate small blisters are present on lateral edge of tongue near tip.

About an hour after my lips and face felt like it was tingling. The following day I felt severe body ache, low grade fever, and headache. At times my face still feels funny and I have had a headache every day for the past 6 days.

                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

                                                After sitting  for about 10 minutes, I noticed my tongue was swelling up in the back of my throat. I noticed my airway was narrowed and tongue felt very tight, but I was still able to breath. I told the man at the doorway assigned to help people find a seat after their shots. He said, &#34;We all have different reactions,&#34; brought me water, and I drank it.  After another 10 minutes, the symptoms were the same, not better not worse. After 10 more minutes the symptoms were better. And after another 10 minutes, I left.  When I made it back to my car, I noticed tightening across my forehead. This developed into a frontal lobe headache which continued off and on for the next 3 days. Also noted for the next 2 days was waking with swollen lips, face and extremities, and occasional ringing in the ears lasting 1-2 hours.

Tongue seemed to affected during the first several days, especially along the sides, red. Didn&#39;t get concerned at first.  The common sore arm, cleared up within a few days. On about day 10 noticed large area on arm where injection given, warm red area about 4 inches by 3 inches, itchy, resolved on own by day 14 or 15.  The next week (third week) mouth seemed to be getting more sore, swallowing harder, took prevacid. Today, day 27, mouth is sore, especially noticeable along sides where there are circle looking ulcerations where surface tissue seems to be missing. Very discouraged. Doubt I feel able to receive second dose which has been postponed, by myself, until day 30. Seeing primary doctor on day 30.

                                                Received vaccine 1/6/2021; immediate redness and pain in injection site. Continued, along with itching, for 2-3 days, then was mostly gone except a warmth and slight discoloration (pink, not red). Began to feel fatigue within the next week. Then, around 1/17 or 18, the heat, pain, itching, and redness returned, along with a painful swelling on the left side  bottom of my mouth, and on the left side bottom of my tongue.  I&#39;d been told someone I knew had pain as well, and was prescribed Benadryl, so I took the over-the-counter type as directed, and within the second dose (after 4 hours), the pain and swelling receded in my mouth and on my arm. Within a day, I had no more mouth pain, and the arm feels better, although it&#39;s still pink, itchy, and warm.

After 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine, I woke up the 2nd day with my neck lymph glands completely swollen, my jaw hurt really bad, and every tooth in my mouth hurt, and I had another infected tooth on the other side of my mouth.  I had to take an antibiotic for both tooth infections.  Teeth were not infected prior.  By the end of day 2, my lymph nodes were back to normal using Advil for swelling.

                                                I have been having left arm pain every since having the vaccine. I thought it would go away but the discomfort is now when I have Range of Motion upward and the discomfort is in my shoulder, arm area and a little below the injection site. I still am having that discomfort and in addition to that, that past 7 days I have been having neck and jaw pain like in the node areas front and back of my next. As well as my lower lip has has two episodes of swelling but it goes down and then it feels ok. I generally overall just don?t feel well.  Eye and head pain as well.  I thought it was best that this be reported cause I just don?t know what is going on. I have made an appointment with my doctor which is on Feb 5.

I used slow breathing methods to try to reduce my shaking. I used an extra large heating pad with 4 blankets but could not get my body warm. I felt like i was suffering from hypothermia. I moved my heating pad around to large body parts to try to warm individual body parts to  slow my severe shaking.  My  severe shaking and extreme chills  went on for at least 4 hours. I felt nauseous and felt like I might vomit. I got in shower at 6;30 am to get into a hot shower. I could not lift my left leg without extreme pain in my lower left back. The pain in my back then moved to my hips, then my upper right side. I had diarrhea for 2 days and indigestion after eating small bits of food.   I took Tylenol gel caps on Sunday morning with a full glass of water and went to sleep at 10:00 am. I woke up with my hip joints and left ear pain.

She states that she has a history of adverse reactions to flu vaccines that are anaphylactic like in the past.  She usually premedicates with Benadryl and steroids.  Today she did take 100 mg of Benadryl prior to her vaccination.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine, she did feel like her throat was getting a little bit tight but she did not feel like it was true anaphylaxis.  However she then felt very off.  After this vaccine her throat started to feel tight, and she stated she did not feel well overall.  She did have some tunnel vision and was shaky. At about 1730 her heart rate drops to the 30s, she started feeling itchy, and then she went into a coughing fit and started to feel her throat close. She received 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, 20 mg IV famotidine, 125 mg IV methylprednisone, 0.5 mL of nebulized racepinephrine, and 500 mL NS bolus. She has since recovered and is stable on room air.

Then that night my arm was  very sore and warm  where the injection was given. It was difficult to lift my arm. Also severe body aches and fatigue. Then I started to have a  severe headache, head pressure and ringing in my ears . Took my blood pressure and it was 145/98, 155/101 and 160/100. I am monitoring it daily and it has not been below 147/92 and as high as 163/97. I have never had a problem with my blood pressure before.

My blood pressure readings 140/70, 166/76, 144/80 and 161/89. My doctor put me on BP medication, Metoprolol to take for a few days. I also experienced jaw pain and I went to the dentist where an x-ray was done, which was negative. I was also put on antibiotics due to a suspected middle ear infection. I felt like I had a spiral headache.  I saw my PCP, nurse practitioner who gave me a steroid injection which helped. I have cancelled my second dose injection. I have been sick for 4 weeks. I still have the jaw pain with a ringing sensation to my left ear.  Tomorrow I will go get more tests done. I am also having swollen neck with lymph nodes swollen.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the vaccine on Thursday I had a very metallic taste. Shortly after breakfast on the morning of the 25 I had a lump in my throat as though my food didn&#39;t go all the way down. Then, as the day wore on I got more &amp; more fatigued; later in the day my lips were mildly numb. I had no appetite at supper time and started getting a headache along with chills. All day Saturday I had flu-like symptoms, chills (no fever) extreme tiredness and a dull headache and laid under a blanket all day, no energy. Saturday evening around dinner time I started feeling better and Sunday woke up feeling as though nothing had happened other than a dull headache and soreness at the injection site.

                                                That night my arm (at the site and the entire muscle) was very sore and felt heavy; this pain continued throughout the following day.  At about 8:00 AM on the morning following the injection, I had chills with intense muscle spasms.  At about 9:00 AM, I developed a headache (and I am not at all prone to headaches).  I was also extremely thirsty.  By 9:30 I developed a fever which lasted all day.  I was teaching and had no access to Tylenol, so I taught through it.  My temp ranged from 99.8 to 103.8.  I also felt weak and woozy.  When I got home,  took two extra strength Tylenol and rested.  I had a few bouts of chills and loose stools.  I went to bed at 10:00 PM, slept well, and woke with no adverse symptoms at all, other than a sore arm.  I was very surprised by these physical side effects as this was the first time I have had adverse effects from any medication.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

It continues to get worse, painful, spreading in my mouth and I felt it in my throat. Around day 4 of symptoms, it felt painful in my gums as if they were a little swollen or had sores in them. Mostly on the right side on my tongue and right side of my mouth, with my tongue the worst. But it is all over my mouth and hurts swallowing. On day 5, I woke up with swollen lips and in so much pain (kept increasing every day) and I went to the immediate care. Doctor said mouth is all red with the white mouth sores that are painful. Diagnosis was ?mucositis? mouth sores and I got prescribed prednisone, lidocaine hydrochloride solution to rinse, and another medicine by mouth.   Concurrently from that Monday (2 days after shot): onset of flu-like symptoms: feverish for a day, extreme fatigue, headaches, body aches and pains.

A medical assistant called Emergency Medical Services (EMS) immediately and the Physicians Assistant went over to assess patient&#39;s symptoms.   During the wait time for EMS?s arrival, the physicians assistant performed an assessment. Patient states to have experienced lightheaded-ness, mouth/tongue tingling, shortness of breath and palpitations. She denied throat constriction, denied itching, redness or pain at the site of injection. She said the tingling she did experience resolved around 20 mins post-injection.   During the assessment, the physicians assistant noted clear breath sounds, irregular health rhythm, increased heart rate, extra-ocular movements intact with no nystagmus, no redness or swelling on the injection site and good grip strength.   Upon EMS arrival at approximately 10:48 pm, the firefighters triaged as per their assessment. She expressed that she is taking ?Lexapro? and allergic to sulfa-drugs. She claims to be ?borderline diabetic? and that the lightheaded-ness has ?never happened before?  The EMS took her to a separate room in the building and assessed her further. After approximately 20 minutes she left and did not leave in an ambulance against medical advice.  She left with her husband and went home. She was made aware that she should go to the hospital immediately if she felt her health was compromised.

                                                A single blister (less than 1cm in diameter) appeared at back of roof of mouth near rear-most molar on left side. Gums inflamed and bleeding around tooth number 12 when brushing teeth in the morning. Blister broke within 3 hours of being noticed, leaving a slightly tender spot on roof of mouth. Around 11pm on 13 March, right outer ear felt warm, tender to the touch, and inflamed. (For decades, I have been regularly experiencing headaches once or twice a month and this ear often becomes tender at the same time of the headaches. I did not have a headache during this occurrence of outer ear pain.)

Throat started to swell up, and dry, very nauseous, shaking while no fever, eliminated all stools, and my heart staryed to beat fast mixed up with irregularity. It settled a bit after 1 hour after i did Therapy, a tapping method to support the immune system and help with adverse reactions. Stayed nauseous for days, and as of today 3/14/2021 i still don&#39;t feel like myself yet. Still tired, weak, a bit shaky, just off.

I went to the ER and my heart felt like it was pounding out of my chest. Once they gave me the Benadryl, Pepcid and steroids via IV, it got better but didn&#39;t go away. They also gave me oral steroids to take at home. The symptoms remained for 3 days or more. I also had a metallic taste in my mouth. I was awakened during the night multiple times. After about 3 days the itchiness and blotchiness went away, but the taste remained for like a week. After a full week, I was back to 100%.

All these lasted 24 hours. Stomach problems still continues, almost 3 weeks. First stomach pain(upper part of stomach), and burning, than pain, couple days pain in the stomach and metallic taste in the moth.. pain still continues but a bit more under control with medication.  It feels like there is something on the top part of my stomach..  Tried several medications, not all taken on same days but switched to some different one when the one I am using was not working well. Tums, milk of magnesia,  pepto-bismal  stopped all but now using Prilosec.

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a consumer [United States] concerning 60 years old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) and experienced worsening of meniere&#39;s disease symptoms/meniere&#39;s disease, scratchy throat/oropharyngeal discomfort, sinus pressure/paranasal sinus discomfort, dry cough/cough, phlegm/productive cough, vomiting.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 046A21A) on 18 Mar 2021 intramuscularly in the unknown injection site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 18 Mar 2021 the patient developed a dry cough, scratchy throat, sinus pressure, phlegm, vomiting x1, and worsening of her Meniere&#39;s disease symptoms. The medically significant event is meniere&#39;s disease. Treatment of the event was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided.  The outcome of the events worsening of meniere&#39;s disease symptoms, scratchy throat, sinus pressure, dry cough, phlegm, and vomiting was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a strong temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Vomiting is consistent with the product known safety profile.

                                                I recently retired after 37 years and now stay and provide significant weekly care for my elderly parents.  Because I am a primary caregiver for my parents, and have been throughout the months of the pandemic, I explored various potential paths to ethically and appropriately get in line for a vaccination.  When I took my mother in for her second vaccination at the Health Department in late in March I was able, while my mother was waiting, to converse with a county public health care worker about options and avenues for me to obtain the vaccine as well. She could see, clearly, that I was a caregiver for my mother, so she took down my name and number, and she called me the next day to say that I could, as a caregiver, proceed to sign up for their next clinic vaccination day that would be happening on Thursday, April 1st.   I arrived for my noon vaccination time at the Health Department before 12 on Thursday, April 1st. I proceeded through the check in line and screening questions, and arrived at vaccination site #1 at 12:05 where I was promptly given the Moderna vaccine (lot #026B21A).  Within seconds of the injection, I knew that I was having a reaction. My heart immediately began pounding, my tongue swelled and the room disintegrated into swirling flashes of color. I looked into the kind eyes of my vaccinator and remember distinctly saying to her in those first few post-injection seconds that, I was, ??sorry, but I think that I am having a reaction.?  The vaccinator then took me over to the nursing site coordinator who proceeded to check and record my vitals. I do not have that sheet with the vitals that she recorded, but I do remember that my heart rate and blood pressure measures were high. I sat as she continued to monitor me.  After 20-30 minutes, as best I can recall, my vitals were not improving, but remained elevated and even seemed to be trending higher. Also, the swelling and tingling in my tongue was worsening and seemed to be spreading to my lips and face, and down to the base of my neck.  I began to feel dizzy, like I was going to faint, so she had me lay on the floor with my legs elevated.  Additionally, it was becoming more difficult to breath because of the pressure in my neck. She had earlier and initially offered me Benadryl for the symptoms I was experiencing but I did not previously have good luck with Benadyrl the one time I took it, and also was unsure if I would have been able to swallow it. At 12:40 she thus gave me an injection of epinephrine (3mL) in my thigh and an ambulance was called. I was transported to the ER at the hospital. (Please note that the nursing site coordinator provided top-notch, high quality care through-out my entire emergency medical reaction experience, and I am very grateful and appreciative of her professional and caring response.)  In ER they monitored my blood pressure and pulse, and other aspects of my heart rhythm, as well as the swelling and tingling that continued in my tongue, lips, face and forehead.  I met with the Dr., and worked with RNs during my time there where they continued to monitor me for a number of hours. By about 4:30, when my vitals had returned to normal and stabilized for over an hour, they released me from the hospital. Since my release from the hospital, late in the afternoon on Thursday, April 1, I have noted only a few, relatively minor persisting symptoms which have included tongue, lip and face numbness and tingling. Also, I have noted, from time to time, some periods of continued heart rate elevation, though wonder if it is more of an almost ?PTSD? type of reaction than a pure physiological response, since, for example, just retelling this story right now is causing my heart rate to rise as I recall what happened.  Needless to say, this vaccination induced medical event, explained above, made for a surreal and frightening day unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Processing of it, and grappling with its implications, from concrete to existential, is seeming equally daunting, and it is here where I have a range of questions for which I am seeking assistance and perspective from the CDC:  The most concrete types of vaccination questions first: They indicated I should not try to obtain the second dose of the Moderna vaccine but that I should consult and maybe it could be given to me in a hospital setting? I welcome thoughts and feedback on how to proceed to become ?fully vaccinated.? What about another vaccine?  What about the additional boosters now being discussed for the new variants? Will I need to consider a ?cave dwelling? of some type for myself in the future since I will not have the vaccination card that is being discussed as ?the ticket to travel? in the future?  Will there be special cards for folks like me who tried but for whatever strange immunological reason was not able to take the vaccine? Increasingly complex, bigger picture questions next: Would any type of ?reach-out? to Moderna be in order? Or, do you, at the CDC, reach out to Moderna for me as a result of this VAER? Are they studying people like me?  My sense, from what little reading I have done, is that what happened to me, though severe, is rare, though definitely want the producers of the vaccine to know about my experience. Bordering on existential questions: What does this mean for me and my life going forward? Should I meet with Moderna, or some type of allergy specialist to better understand what may have happened, and what I will need to watch out for in the future? As everyone begins sharing vaccination cards and experiences, what should I say? I don?t want to scare others away from doing what is needed to save lives by sharing my experience, and don?t want to fuel the ?anti-vaxers.? What about the lingering disquiet and unease that something I sought to help and protect me seems like it might have/nearly killed me? The pandemic has already shaken and taken so much in so many of our lives.  Immunization seemed to promise to give back some of what the pandemic has taken, yet, feeling now that ?normal? is not only more distant but possibly will not be achievable for folks like me, rare though we seem to be?

Felt nauseated/ did not vomit. My eyes ached. I stayed in bed for 24 hours. Two days after the injection most of the symptoms had subsided but my vision was very blurry. I have experienced the same type of blurry vision after taking Nyquil, so I don&#39;t take it anymore. Now 3 days after the second Covid shot, my vision is clearing. I am developing a cold sore which I feel may be another reaction to the vaccine. I did not take any medication for the symptoms and did not report it to my doctor. I just wanted the fact of the symptoms to be included with the CDC data.

                                                At approximately 3:30 pm the next day (27 hours later), I noticed significant tearing from both eyes, while outside walking. When I returned home, and checked in the mirror, I noticed significant puffiness around the eyes (though not to the point of closure or impaired vision), especially in the inner corners (L&gt;R). I contacted my PCP at 4:45 pm and was instructed to go to the Urgent Care. I was seen there and evaluated, then was discharged without any treatment plan. I had no other symptoms and felt great, and even felt the puffiness had subsided a little bit by the time I left the clinic. Today, 1/8/2021, at 7:30 am awakening, the eyes are quite puffy again, and my nose actually appears a bit swollen on the sides near the eyes. I hear clicking sounds in my sinuses and have a small amount of sinus pressure. I applied ice packs to the eye lids in an effort to reduce swelling, which seems to help a little.   Please note that I had botox in my forehead and around the outside corners of the eyes, and dermal filler under the eyes (12/7/2021), this being the first time for the filler.

All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Walked in the bathroom had pain in stomach, was very hot and freezing at the same time, was shaking. Head hurt was hurting so bad. Tried standing up from toilet, was passed out. Eye, half of face is bruised and swollen , eye shut for two days. More than forty minutes passed before she could call her husband. Does not remember anything because she was passed out. Husband came in and grabbed her, to get her back into bed. she could not stand. Went to ER at  Hospital. Had CT scan, blood work , EKG, chest xray. Was still kind of out of it but was able to communicate with nurses. Face is still black and blue. Last night got up at 4:00 a.m. something was wrong with her throat. Felt like a walnut was in her throat. Went to doctor this morning. They said it was a reaction from the shot. Got an EpiPen, prednisone. Call them in 2 days to let them know how she&#39;s doing and also wear a heart monitor because they do not know how to take care of her, Has had vision blurriness in both eyes. Has not felt well at all.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

However, I could breathe easily so I just remained to relax and slowly swallowing my salia over and over again. Once home took a benedryl and was able to drink water without any problems. My throat is still somewhat scratchy after 2 hours.

Everything was fine within 2 days. Like nothing happened. On Day 9 experianced a flash of light out of left eye and a floating blob that came and went throughout the day. Saw Dr and he said this is typical of the aging process.  Dont know if it was related just weird it happened now. Arm was sore for 2 Days but nothing major. Other than that i felt fine.

                                                16 hours after my second dose of the Moderna vaccination, I started having intermittent sense of smell episodes.  The smell is very strong and very unpleasant, almost revolting.  They are combination smells that I can&#39;t readily describe.  I have been inside my home while this is happening and not cooking or being exposed to anything new or different.  I have not ever in my life had this experience and believe that somehow it is related to the vaccination I just received yesterday.  My first does was fine with no side effects other than a sore arm.  Again, my arm is sore and a little swollen at injection site but that is fine and expected!  The smell thing is extremely strange.  I&#39;m just going to wait it out but I thought for research sake, Moderna would want to know about this side effect.

At around 11:00 the next morning all symptoms had subsided with the exception of feeling exhausted.   I was using v-safe to report my symptoms but never received any reminders about the second shot, and did not get a reminder until Sunday, which of course by then, all symptoms  were gone and answered how I felt that day which was fine.  I just felt it was important to report the symptoms accurately.

                                                10 minutes after receiving vaccine I had sudden sharp pains in my right ear.  I have had extensive surgery in and around that ear due to cholesteatoma and perilymph fistula, and I have had some nerve damage to the balance nerve.  The bones of hearing have been removed and replaced with titanium artificial bones that do not work, so I am deaf in that ear.  These pains were severe, as if a number of steak knives were stabbing me at once, but the pain only lasted about a minute and subsided.  3 or 4 minutes later the pain recurred exactly as before but lasted a shorter duration and at a lower level of pain.  The ear felt congested the rest of the day and I avoided driving after getting home.  I have had no further problems, except that I went for more dental work on 2/8, and had a dizzy spell after getting anesthetic, maybe a little heart racing for just 5 minutes or so.

It felt very odd and was very scary. I had no tingling  in my lips or in my throat. I could speak, drink water and eat. The sensation lasted approximately 5 hours until it felt somewhat back to normal.  I have my second doze of the Moderna vaccine scheduled for March 5. I am worried about getting it after having this reaction.  Please advise me.

She was even unable to remove her dentures due to the tightness.  This continued into the next day.  No shortness of breath reported.  She took some Benadryl which she reports helped however it has been 5 days now and she continues to have poor taste and tongue is still feeling strange.  She also states today she is developing the tongue and lip swelling again, she denies trouble breathing and is aware if at any time this begins or there is any concern this may start to call 911 for emergency care.  She is taking Benadryl again now which has helped with this since the immunization and has left a message with her PCP.  I am currently calling her PCP to report this also.

Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

They were like black strings.  I have NEVER had swirlies in my life.  At 8:00 PM Feb 27 on top of the swirlies that had moved to my peripheral vision left side of the left eye, I began having bright flashes like lightening.  On Sunday  Feb 28 the swirlies stayed just as peripheral vision and the bright flashes were noticed more in the late evening.   Today March 1 they are still there and were more noticeable as I was driving to work.  As I am typing this the swirlie moves from the center to the left side of the eye.

The symptoms kept getting worse so I went to urgent care and received an inhaler. I&#39;m one week out and all but the SOB have resoled. The SOB seems to be improving but I feel like I&#39;m still somewhat in a fog. I had lesions in my mouth for 5 days.  I developed left sided enlarged lymph nodes, TMJ and ear pain for 2 days with discomfort in the left breast and axillary. This has resolved.  I had a follow up appt today (3/3/21) and was prescribed an Epi-Pen.

                                                I had the vaccine on 2/16. On 2/22 at 5:30 pm  I suddenly started having double vision. I saw an eye doctor that evening. I had no face drooping. I had not headache or muscle weakness and my pupils were the same size. If I covered one eye (did not matter which one) the double vision was not present. The next morning 2/23 I woke up with no double vision but throughout the day it came back a few times but resolved each time.  I went to Medical Center on 2/2 and had a complete exam. So far all labs have come back in normal range. I have tracked my blood pressure twice a day since this happened.  BP is great   I am a very healthy person.  Exercise daily. The only thing different in my life is having the vaccine dose. It was my first dose.   The double vision seems to be resolving more and more each day. Happening less and shorter episodes. My eyes have been check by medical extensively on 2/2. They cannot find a reason for the double vision.   I would like to know if this has been reported by anyone else  and if so did it resolve. Also if the person took the second dose and did they have problems. I am supposed to have my second dose on 2/16.  I am not sure what I should do.  I still have symptoms although they are much milder and seem to be resolving.   I have never felt bad at all during any of it and have continued to exercise.

Within 5 minutes of that, my mouth filled with a &#39;metalic&#39; taste( not exactly, but as close as I can get) then the roof of my mouth at the gum line began to &#39;blister&#39; or become sensitive.   This morning, after taking my synthroid, the entire roof of my mouth is now affected.  My morning coffee seemed to improve it for a bit.  It&#39;s not a severe reaction, but one worth reporting. My injection site is tender, but that&#39;s not unusual.

I had a sore throat for about 15 days; at about one week past this dose, my right shoulder froze &amp; the rotator joint was swollen &amp; incredibly painful to the touch.  I lost the use of my right arm entirely for about five days, then the swelling &amp; pain slowly subsided.  My eyes were burning &amp; my arm was weak but I made a full recovery about 18 days after this dose.  The last symptoms were severe headaches, accompanied by an inability to remain asleep.  I took Tylenol &amp; Tylenol PM to alleviate pain &amp; regain some sleep &amp; did report these symptoms to my doctor.

After vomiting I felt immediately somewhat better, EMT took blood pressure and she said it was normal. EMT took blood sugar and she said  it was normal All less than 15 minutes after shot. We then waited at EMT direction for another 15 minutes. We left the clinic and parked just outside till 10:30. I am now feeling better, just tired.

Then the area from my left ear to my cheek and left side of nose felt numb.   Almost like novocaine had been injected.     After 10 minutes my chest started feeling a little tight.     After 15 minutes I left the facility and used my inhaler (I have occasional asthma) and my chest opened right up.   The numb feeling on left side of my face &amp; ear persisted and I developed a headache around my left eye.   I was very tired that afternoon, took tyelenol and went to bed early.   Woke up and the numbness was mostly gone.

Later that evening My are was sore and I continued to be dizzy. By nighttime I felt achy and tired. About 6 hours after the shot a fever started and I took Tylenol. By 1am I had 101.3, the rigors and a headache and dizziness which I still have 4 days later. My fever ran for over 48 hours and would not respond to any  ibuprofen or Tylenol. My joint and muscle pain was severe, my balance was off. I could barely move my arm. Today I am now nauseous. I was not this sick when I had Covid. My fever would at least relent. I?ve lost time from work and my life. I have heart palpitations and my resting heart rate has gone up. Pressure feels strange behind my eyes. My legs are sore.   I called my doctor two days after my vaccine and she minimized my symptoms.

The next day, I woke up and both lips were swollen, the left side of my face was swollen and the left side of my lip was twisted to the left.  I contacted my allergist and spoke to him online and sent pictures.  He advised me to take Benedryl  every 4 hours or Zyrtec twice a day.  If it got worse call back.  That evening some of the swollen ness went down.  Little by little each day the swollen went down but the cold sores remained.  By Saturday which is today  the swollen ness is all gone but all the cold sores are remaining and are painful.  I am continuing to take Zyrtec  and treat the cold sores with cream.

Also, a terrible metallic taste in my mouth started making me produce increase saliva. My tongue felt numb and have become swollen. (This took 5-6 hours to subside, the tongue swelling was about 2x size but never increased beyond that size.) Also, during the time the systems started, I had waves of prickly or fizzy feelings that were different from the chills. These lasted at least 24 hours.

                                                Nine days after receiving the vaccine, my vaccine site on my arm started itching really bad, and when I went to scratch it, I felt a very large (~size of a tennis ball) bump on my arm that was also very hard and very red. Initially, I thought it must be a spider bite, though I haven?t noticed any spiders in my home, and I simply watched it for any sign of infection (which never happened). The next day I also noticed an unusually high degree of fatigue which limited my ability to do much of anything for three days, thus far! Throughout the day and night, without warning, my eyes become really heavy, and I feel like I?m going to immediately drop off to sleep. My eyes also begin to burn, and when I close them I simply fall asleep for about a half hour. This has been happening off and on all day for three days, so far. I have no idea if there?s any connection to the vaccine or to the sudden appearance of a hard, big, red, itchy bump at the vaccination site on my left arm.

As the day went on, the flu like pain increased by 100%. Dizziness ensued, and I could not move my head without nausea and an intense knife-like pain on the right side of my neck. All previous mildly sore areas were now on fire. Then the sirens happened. I have mild ringing in my ears due to chemotherapy, but this was just like I was standing next to an ambulance, for 8 hours. It has been over a week, and I am still fatigued with body pain.

I took ibuprofen  in the morning before I went to work and  more ibuprofen on my lunch hour and before I went to bed.  No fever, sore arm and very sore glands in my neck on the left side, there is also a lump on my neck.  The pain goes up in my left ear.

Pt was monitored for greater than 30 minutes and stated she was no longer experiencing the symptoms and returned to work. She was checked on an hour later and stated to be doing fine.

                                                An immediate funny taste in my mouth but so I left after sitting for 20 minutes. About 5 min later, my voice started to get hoarse like it does when I&#39;m having an allergic reaction, began coughing and trying to clear throat.  I pulled over and used my inhaler as first line of defense before trying epi pen.  The inhaler got me home, I continued to have the build up in my lungs and breathing issues, wheezing.  I continued to use my inhaler and gave myself a neb treatment.  My arm got hot and it was swollen with bumps and very itchy.  I treated with cool compress, cream and took Benadryl.  I took Benadryl and Loratadine the remainder of that day/evening and into Saturday evening.  Saturday evening, I used my inhaler 1 more time because I felt my lungs filling with phlegm (all clear) and was still coughing.  This last use made me throw up all the clear fluid that was gathering in my lungs and I felt much better and breathing went back to normal.  I used my inhaler once on Sunday and Monday and I haven&#39;t needed it since.  Funny thing, my right arm began to itch and got red and hot in the same area as my left but I got the injection in my left not my right arm.

                                                On Wednesday, March 24th my husband and I got our 1st Moderna vaccine at 8:30 am. Felt good the rest of the day. On Thursday, March 25th I woke up and the bag under my right eye was really swollen and I felt like I had a big cold sore coming out on the top right side of my lip. My arm was swollen like a 2x2 area and tender but other than that I felt good. At 9:30 am that same day I started getting a headache and my stomach felt really upset. I didn&#39;t throw up but felt like I was going to.  About 10:00 am I really felt sick to my stomach and extremely tired. My headache was more intense and mostly on my right side (same side as my eye and cold sore). By noon I had the chills and was running a temperature over 100. At 3:00 when I got done with work I slept. I was only awake for a total of 1 hour and went to bed for the night at 8:15 pm. I still had a bad headache, upset stomach and chills and my arm was swelling bigger but I slept all night. On Friday, March 26th I woke up and my face looked worse. The cold sore was getting bigger and the bag under my eye was huge making my eye almost shut. I still had  a bad headache and the injection site was getting bigger and stuck out far. It was hot to the touch. It was bright red and bumpy and hurt to touch it. I no longer was sick to my  stomach and I had no fever. My face was still looking awful and about 2:00 pm I started running a fever again. I still had a headache. I still felt tired. On Saturday March 27th, my bag under my eye looked a little better but the cold sore was getting worse. I had a slight headache, no fever and not sick to my stomach. However, the lump at the injection site got huge.  It was the size of the palm of my hand and stuck up about an inch. It was hot to the touch and red.  By 9:00 pm my eye and face were worse and the right side of my face was drooping. On Sunday March 28th 8:00 am my face was worse and itchy. The cold sore was spreading up the right side of my drooping face and my eye was almost shut. I called the Teledoc and had a video call. She said that the vaccine triggered a virus in my system. She called in a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM 4 pills. Took 2 pills at noon and then the last 2 that night before bed. She said to give it 2-3 days and it should clear up. On Monday, March 29th 6:30 am the lump in my arm is a little smaller but my eye is worse. I looked horrible. On Tuesday, March 30th I still had a low grade headache and my lip and right side of my face is kinda numb. I called my doctor and made an appointment for Wednesday, March 31st. On Wednesday, March 31, 2021, I woke up and now had a canker sore inside my top lip on the right side of my face in addition to looking like a monster. I went to the doctor?s office at 7:30 am and she said that I definitely have a virus going on and now I have Bell?s Palsy as a result. The doctor gave me a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM tablets to take 3 times a day for 7 days. She also prescribed Prednisone 20 MG to take 3 tablets for 7 days to relief the itching and irritability of my face.

                                                I had the second Moderna shot that afternoon, scheduled for 4:15pm but it was about 4:30pm when I got it.  I moved around as instructed by my doc, and after 15 minutes went back to my car.  I noticed after another several minutes that my pulse was still elevated so opted to go back in and talk to a health care professional.  Pulse was 120.  Paramedic wanted me to lie down in waiting area but I didn&#39;t want to be in such a potentially  germy environment, and the guy next to me who had fainted earlier was just getting up himself.  She walked me back to my car, where I agreed to wait, listen to a stress relief hypnosis audio and see if my pulse rate would calm down.  She came back out w/ a BP cuff and said my blood pressure was 210 over 130 (or some number over 100; I don&#39;t recall which) and she said I needed to get in an ambulance right away and go to the hospital.  I said I would make my own decisions about my body and I wanted to try a couple of other things first, promised not to leave, contacted my doctor, naturopath.  (Note: I did not have any other worrisome symptoms -- blurred vision, dizziness, etc.  My head was a little buzzy, but whether out of fear or in reaction to the shot I didn&#39;t know.  I was a little flushed).  He asked me a bunch of questions, said my body hadn&#39;t had time to mount an immune response to the vaccine and that I had likely had a histamine reaction to a preservative in the vaccine (or similar), which a couple of his other patients had experienced.  He asked if I&#39;d been drinking fluids (yes, plenty), had eaten recently (no, so he suggested I have some food; I had some nuts, a little cheese and some Cheez-Its so had that), asked if I had an antihistamine around -- I did, but I don&#39;t do well with Benadryl and didn&#39;t have Claritin, but after looking through my bag found some Allervive, an herbal product he compounds.  He said, &#34;That&#39;s perfect.&#34;  I took two of the three capsules and hung up.  Staff were checking up on me in my car every ten minutes or so, by the way, very kind and professional as I had been quite upset at the whole &#34;get in an ambulance&#34; scenario.  He thought some of my reaction was probably also stress-related, and I noticed before the shot that I was teary, not from anxiety but the kind you get when you feel relief after a long ordeal.  I didn&#39;t feel anxiety, really, until the first blood pressure measurement.  He also let me know that if the bottom number didn&#39;t drop below 100 they couldn&#39;t let me go.  After eating, drinking some more water and taking the Allervive my BP was down to 138 over 75 in just a few minutes.  I agreed to stick around and make sure it stuck.  We re-tested again about 15 minutes later, perhaps longer, and it was the same.  I had been a little flushed but that had gone away too.  I left and went for a light walk and eventually drove home without incident.  I had symptoms after the shot that could have been related to my body fighting off the allergic reaction or to the vaccine itself, but they were pretty mild (fatigue later that night; occasional heart rate elevation sometimes after eating or with very mild exertion -- not unusual for me if I&#39;m &#34;fighting off&#34; something; sore, itchy, red blotch sized between a quarter and a half dollar at vaccination site -- it is still a little tender today and appears a bit bruised; a bit sinus headache-y for three days, especially when I bent down to tie my shoes or something like that - also not that unusual as I often seem to &#34;cleanse&#34; through my sinuses when I have a bug or am fighting something off).    In hindsight, I think the symptoms I had after the first shot, which lasted about 9 hours, may have been fighting off the allergic reaction and not a reaction to the virus vaccine itself.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

                                                I stayed my 30 minutes as directed in a room since I have needed IV Benedryl in past with blood transfusions. Toward the end of my 30-minute wait, I noticed my lips tingling/swelling.    I ALWAYS carry an antihistamine with me, so  I walked out to my car and noticed that my lips felt full.  I needed to run my tongue around them and I immediately took a Zyrtec.  I never did feel short of breath, but with many times in my life getting giant hives due to allergies/ blood transfusion ( secondary to my hemophilia), I feel this was a type of allergic reaction.  I&#39;ve never had the lip-tingling thing before with any other vaccine.  I&#39;ve had both pneumonia and both Shingrix vaccines and always get my influenza vaccine since I&#39;m immunosuppressed and work in a Doctors office daily.

I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

Then 02/01/21 exactly one week later had a strange feeling in my head not a headache not dizzy just felt an unusual feeling in my head of not feeling quite right especially with movement then 2 hours later had a ringing in my ears have no ear infection noting unusual im an RN and would report any other conditions. then  that evening i began feeling itchy at my injection sight but i was just iching it though my clothes and wondered why i&#39;m so itchy on my shoulder I really didn&#39;t think about the shot as it was 7 days later. The itchy feeling continued so I went to the bathroom took my shirt off and saw a rash which i will include pictures of the rash if I could. i was alarmed and concerned about the big rash and the papules sticking up.  It&#39;s now the next day 02/02/21 I still have a big rash on my arm it&#39;s about 6 inches long 3 inches wide red elevated.  I googled it and it said it was the covid arm or something.  I am willing to provide pictures

                                                Had the second Moderna injected placed on 2/2/2021 in the late morning, and within 2 hours started feeling sore and achy.  By 5:00, my eyes were itchy and burning like they were on fire, then my throat, nose, ears, and then my hands swelled up and itched and felt like they were on fire.  I also had chills.  I took Tylenol and Benadryl and also felt the need to increased my Flovent HFA 220 mcg from once a day to twice a day on Tuesday and Wednesday.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl when and as the symptoms reappeared.  I only needed Benadryl Wednesday night and woke up this morning with a bit of a headache.  Took Tylenol and went to work today.  I feel tired and my hands still hurt this afternoon(Thursday 2/4/2021) .

Decided i had stabilized and sent me home with a prescription of prednisone 40mg for 2 days and then 20 mg for 2 days.

I stayed at injection facility for over an hour to make sure I would feel better.  Later that evening, I was fine without any marks on injection site. Nine days later I got an itchy, sore arm with a bulls eye, raised red rash larger than a quarter, about 1.75&#34; and a bit warmer than other areas of the arm.

By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

                                                Within 1 hour of receiving 2nd vaccine, I started to get pain behind my right eye. That night, the pain turned into shooting pains on right side of head, every 3 to 45 seconds at worse. Head pain continued to Daturday, the 13th, when it stared migrating to right ear (same stabbing-type pain). By Tuesday the 16th, if further migrated to glands below my right jaw line ( same stabbing-type pain). Over last 48 hrs I have also developed scaly patches on right half of scalp. Tonight I started developing scaly rash on top of right side of face.  As of now, stabbing pains continue in right side of head, right ear, and right side of throat.   On Friday the 12th I also had swelling and tenderness under left arm. This has dissipated.

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

Shortly after, I found it difficult to swallow (as if throat) was closing up, numbness in lips, flush face, tingling in fingers. Liquid Benadryl (1 capful) was administered by mouth and within 10 minutes swallowing difficulty was less but still difficult. Within 30 minutes all symptoms subsided.  At no time did I have difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing or any other anaphylaxis symptoms other than the ones described.

After 1 episode of nausea,  I started experiencing more than mild muscle cramps.  Could not lay on either side.  Darkened room because light/ sound was adding to already severe headache. Used cold washcloths on forehead.  Was having trouble trying to walk, use restroom, frequent urination but could only sip water. Over the next 24 hours...just slept and used bathroom.  Severe muscle cramps, chills, fever, headaches.   Called my Dr.&#39;s nurse-she advised to hydrate and to go to ER if needed.  24 hours later, I realized I would be okay...but took me another 24-36 hours to feel 80% normal.  Lost 8LBs. during 48 hours.  Experienced extreme dreams/delusions.

Warm and firm to the touch.  Measures 2.25&#34; S/I  and 1.5&#34; A/P.  It appears to be getting larger as of this evening. No longer individual bumps , more like wheals.   I have used a pen to draw around the perimeter to monitor progress. Also, 3/10/21, experienced left sided jaw pain.  No hx of TMJ disorder, ever!   Unable to open mouth fully and become concerning.

My teeth felt tender and sore.  My lips and tongue felt really strange.  It felt like I had dental work done and the numbing was starting to wear off. Tingling, and very sensitive to food texture (never lost sense of taste).  When I ate, the food texture all tasted like mush.  This went on for several days, and just today (3/21/21), I am beginning to feel more normal (just slight symptoms).

                                                Woke up in the morning and my tinnitus was a lot louder than usual.  (I also had that symptom when I had Covid in late October.)  I felt really tired even though I just woke up.  Also tired throughout the day. I was cold all day. Had a fever. I was sore/achy on sides of my body from under my arms to my waist. Sore arm at injection site. I took Tylenol in the early evening and that made me start feeling better.

The vertigo has persisted but has lessened since Saturday night/Sunday morning.  My right ear also seems plugged and there is ringing in my left ear.  I started feeling slightly nauseous on March 22.

Observed for any changes and would have sought treatment if it had advanced. Lasted approx. 2 hours. Lip returned to normal size. Would not have submitted this report if I I was not due for second shot on April 16th. Concerned because have had allergic reactions to several medication in past NSAID very serious reaction and Lisinopril severe rash. Question - should I pre-medicate with benadryl prior to second injection?

Within an hour, the left side of my face was numb back to behind my left ear. My eardrum was tingling also. I had slight swelling on my face and tightness of my cheek muscle. I never felt any tingling or numbness in my throat or tongue. It took about 36 hours for it to completely go away.

I barely could walk to the bathroom and I layed on the floor because of the pain in my head. I can feel the pulse of my heartbeat in my head. I had intense nausea. I managed to get to bed. I drove to work the next day but my boss sent me home because I was the same. My eyes feel like they are flickering and are in pain. I feel like its a nerve in my eyes that are messing with me and are very painful. I am afraid to take the second shot.

Fatigue and Headaches continue daily in the afternoons and evenings.  Then 2 days later my lips started to swell, which progressed in intensity for 3 more days until my lips and tongue split, blistered, developed more asthma and difficulty breathing but not enough to use EpiPen or go to ER, and also my tongue felt thicker.  Called Immunologist on day 6 (Monday morning).  He ordered blood work.  The symptoms started to decrease on day 10 -16 but continue to have to use Symbicort 2x/day vs 1x/day and still get very fatigued as the day progresses and daily headaches.  My lips will swell easily with allergens and an increase in asthma.

                                                The day after I received the first dose of my vaccine, I felt numb on my tongue, around my mouth, and hands. In addition, I also experienced a low fever. Then on the third and fourth day, I stated to feel numb on my arms, thighs, fingertips and the bottom of my feet.  I also started to feel chest pain, back pain, and experience migraines. I&#39;ve felt very tired throughout this time, had a dry mouth. The tops of my feet and hands were slightly swollen and my veins were much more prominent as well. The palm of my hands are always very warm and have a visibly pink color. During this time frame, I&#39;ve seen also seen my GP twice. As of today, overall, all of these symptoms have lessened in severity. Although the feeling of numbness has also lessened in severity as well, the slight feeling of numbness is still present as of today-especially on my tongue (23 days after my first dose of the vaccine).

It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.

Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Awoke 3:30 am next day(approx. 13 hours post injection)from sound sleep with strange feeling in my tongue. Felt swollen, but dont think it was, burning sensation on lateral borders and tip of tongue,extremely dry mouth.  Felt as though it had also been burned, and had a few white spots on tip, reddened borders on lateral aspects also, very scallopededges. Note I do have a fissured tongue but this reaction was unlike any I had ever had from eating certain foods that trigger any tongue response, and had not eaten anything night before to trigger this. Lasted a few days and progressively felt normal after 3-4 days.

I returned to the vaccination distribution site - EMT&#39;s checked my O2, pulse and blood pressure which were all normal.  They check my blood sugar which was at 40.  I had eaten about 90 minutes before (egg, toast, coffee).  They administered glucose and rechecked 10 minutes later.  I was at 41.  I was oriented and by then the numbness and dizziness had subsided and has completely resolved. I experienced flu-like symptoms beginning in the evening of 1/22 and continuing consisting of tiredness, body aches, runny nose, sneezing, cough, stomach rumblings and diarrhea (mainly on 1/24).

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

I was given a dose of 25 mg of benedryl and asked to remain in the observation area for an hour.  The tingling stopped within the hour and I went home.  I was fine the rest of the day but experienced fatigue and a sore throat on Days 2 and 3 after vaccination.  I was told to get a COVID test and it came back negative.  I am fine now.  I will get my second dose on Feb 13th.

                                                I am an RN. Got my first Covid vaccine on Jan 9th 2021. A week later my eyes burned and itched horribly. Also my scalp itched terribly. Never had this in my life. I used some eye drops and in a few days it went away. 28 days later, got my 2nd Covid vaccine. Again about 5 days later my eyes are burning and itching as well. I have never had allergies to anything. I am again putting eye drops in. Systane and Visine. I also have gotten a very tiny blister below my right eye. Very tiny..smaller than a pea. I don&#39;t see this side effect anywhere written. I am not allergic to dust or animal dander. I am 63 years old. Just wanted you to be aware, I believe this is caused by the vaccine.

It was getting hard to breath, so I got ice and sucked on it for awhile, then I put a cold cloth on my face, tried to relax and the swelling seemed ok.  I stayed up all night because I was afraid that it would get worse, At about 9:30a.m. it seemed to be getting back to normal with just a little swelling in the back of my tongue.  I felt terrible for the next three days and still don&#39;t feel great. Sore joints, got chills, headache.  I am not going in for the second shot.

PCP; She gave me medicine to get sugar down;  Jarviance 1/21 Blood sugar went up to 495; went to ER.Opthamologist;  He told me nothing he could do for me. He told me I had vision reversed due to sugar being so high. He told me he couldn&#39;t give me any glasses as when sugar decreases, the vision will go back to normal.

And then I got a shooting pain up from neck to ear; shortness of breath; lips were tingling and mouth was going numb (like a was getting Novocain) and I got a headache and then I got an earache too; I started to feel itchy - all within a short time. I was given Benadryl. It was enough to get my home. I took another Benadryl and I was okay from all my symptoms except the itching (like I was in an ant next) that itching lasted for three days even with taking Benadryl.

                                                All three reactions were the same. I woke up feeling like my throat had a flap that was not allowing me to inhale. I had been snoring and work up abruptly because I couldn&#39;t breathe at that moment.  If I inhaled sharply or sniffed hard to try and clear my throat, my airway blocked. I had a fever and also swollen glands in my neck and under my jaw. Once I got out of bed, I drank a glass of cold water and walked outside in the cold. I felt like it was an allergic reaction; so I took a Benadryl and I tried to go back to bed, but when I laid down it seemed worse, so I spent the night in my recliner. The first reaction was the worst in severity and happened about two weeks after my first injection. The second reaction was less than two weeks later,  the last one happened 4 days after my second injection. All three incidents lasted about 12 hours, but I still feel like my glands are a bit swollen, and I have a hesitation when I swallow. I talked to my doctor today 3/1, he ordered a COVID test and ordered me to quarantine until I get the results.

There also was tingling across the front of my collar bone down both arms to my fingertips. I got a mild headache and felt overall &#34;wrung out&#34;; a sense of weakness and lethargy. These feelings began as I was leaving the Vaccination Clinic (approximately 17 minutes after receiving my shot) and was walking to my car. They  lasted about 2 &amp; 1/2 hours from beginning to end. After that I felt just fine.

It has remained elevated and very loud since my vaccination. (much louder than before my vaccination) . Before I barely heard it during the day, but mostly at night, but post-vaccine, I hear it all the time.  There is no treatment for tinnitus except to continue my daily dosage of Triamterene.  I will address it with my Dr. at my next appointment in April. I hope the outcome will be that my tinnitus returns to levels prior to the vaccine.

After I felt better I ate shrimp on 2-13 and 2-17 and had a reaction to the shrimp on 2-17 which required a doctor visit and complete bloodwork analysis which showed allergy to shrimp and a high titer which could be an auto immune disorder.  Since then I have logged foods and have determined I have  reactions when something has MSG or Maltodextrin.  I have dry back of my throat, a feeling that I have a lump in my throat,  eyes seem a little dry,  the headache has not gone away.  Pressure on the top of my head and my forehead.  Tingling and on fire in hands wrists, forearms, shins and ankles.  I have an appointment with a Rheumatologist on March 30.

                                                Around 10:00 the night after receiving the first covid injection, I got a very strong &#34;chemical&#34; taste in my mouth and I could also smell the &#34;chemical&#34; smell at the same time. It was not something I&#39;ve ever smelled or tasted before. It lasted for only a second or two, then was gone. It hasn&#39;t happened again. The next day, I talked to my friend and she said the same thing happened to her, but she thought it was just her imagination. I urged her to report it to the CDC as well. I informed my doctor and she told me to report my incident to the CDC, which is what I&#39;m doing here.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  About 5 hours after vaccination I noticed red lines across the tops of my eyelids. It looked like someone had scratched a across the lids.  My skin felt irritated and the lids of my eyes started to swell. The swelling was not enough that I couldn?t open my eyes but my lids felt very heavy.  I could feel the skin was raw and raised where I could see the red line. It look at least 4 days to the swelling to completely go away.

Noticed eyesight blurred. Pharmacist told me my chest &amp; face were bright red. I felt slightly nauseous &amp; my mouth tasted like penny&#39;s. Pharmacist administered antihistamine. By this time I had a bad headache &amp; feeling of pressure in chest &amp; head. I was made to sit in lobby &amp; wait 30 min. I continued feeling strangely unwell for 8 days. My b.p. went up &amp; I felt anxious &amp; exhausted. Arm hurt. No temp. On day 3 ( I believe..or day 4) arm became even more painful &amp; A round rash appeared. My chest &amp; neck were also red again . I took pictures of my arm, chest &amp; neck.

                                                Four days after vaccination, I woke up with a lot of eye watering/ leakage that cakes/ goes on to under eye area. And this has been going since then (reporting date March 21, 2021). Did see an optometrist who used a slit lamp and determined an eye infection. Taking antibiotics and eye drops (antibiotics with steroid) but still having issues. Eyes not red but very leaky. This is not clearly a reaction to the vaccination but am reporting as it happened within four days after vaccination and is curious/ not usual at all for me and being ongoing. Drainage made skin on upper cheeks very red and angry.

That evening - had headache and general body aches and muscle tightness - next day extremely fatigued with headache (headache was mostly left side) - Symptoms clearer mostly after 2nd day after vaccine 3/19/2021 - but the most prominent symptoms were shortly after vaccine when I got into car to drive home.

                                                Shot was at 12;15 pm. By 7 pm I was having trouble with light sensitivity, pupils were not dilated.  By next morning eyes were extremely painful, almost swollen shut, extremely light sensitive.  End of the 24th (the next day) eyes still light sensitive, now have a low fever.

I was still experiencing symptoms on Thursday after being dosed on Monday. I had vivid dreams on Wednesday night that were very detailed.  Thursday I began to have GI effects with nausea and diarrhea. I was not able to eat until late Wednesday evening.   I did drink water and took Tylenol.

                                                On 11 Mar 2021 at 11:00 am (23.5 hours post vaccine) I had a mild headache and significant dizziness. I had to leave my work desk. This lasted for approximately 2 hours and then &#34;lifted&#34; and I went back to work.  At 4:00pm, about 5 hours later (28.5 hours post vaccine) I felt a total lack of concentration, extreme fatigue, and dizziness. I should have left my desk but had work I needed to complete. This episode also lasted for about 2 hours and then I felt pretty normal again. The following day, on 12 Mar 2021, at 5:00 pm (53.5 hours post vaccine) I had what I described to my sister as  crazy dizziness and extreme lethargy. This lasted for 2-3 hours, I was able to go out with my husband to a store, but was not able to drive. I also experience two days where I had a metallic taste in my mouth. It was not overwhelming, and since I&#39;m sensitive to odors and chemicals anyway I just assumed that there was something in my home I was exposed to, even though that had never happened to me before in my home. This probably occurred on day 3 &amp; 4  post vaccine (13 Mar 2021 and 14 Mar 2021) but I did not annotate the details. I am very suspicious this was also related to the vaccine. As I think about my past few days, especially while at work, I think I am having a harder time than normal concentrating, although at times I have perfect clarity and feel normal.

Then about a half hour after that, the tip of my tongue started tingling. Then a little bit after that my throat got a little tiny bit tight and dry.  Then by 2:00 in the afternoon all the symptoms disappeared. Then the next day, I felt just a little bit nauseous. Then the next day the numb lips and tingling tongue returned, except that only the left side of my lips felt numb, and only the left front quadrant of my tongue was tingling.the right side of my lips were fine and the right side of my tongue was fine. Today is April 2nd, and I still feel the tingling on the left side of the front of my tongue. That is constant. The numbness in my lips has faded, but it&#39;s still there.

                                                The day following my injection I experienced escalated Tinnitus.  Different tones and pitches.  Occasional ear pain.  Feeling of fullness in the ears that was not present before vaccine. Neck and shoulder pains.  1 week away from second dose and I am still experiencing escalated tinnitus.   Slightly improved from initial response but escalated from level before injection.  I feel I have had some hearing loss.

                                                Driving home after vaccine injection, lips started tingling.  When I arrived home, cheeks started to swell.  I immediately took 2 Benadryl (otc) by mouth and applied ice to the swelling on my face.  When Benadryl wore off, swelling began again, so I took 2 tablets of Benadryl, had to repeat two more times.   As of April 30th at 8 a.m.,  I am not taking Benadryl.  Face is still slightly swollen.  If the swelling starts increasing, will take Benadryl.

A week later, increased soreness at injection site, entire upper third portion of my  arm was red, warm to the touch, sometimes itchy.  Arm felt tight and firm.  Slight headache which advil seemed to manage throughout the day.   1/12/21 woke with jaw pain, neck pain in back of neck on both sides, headache, temp of 99.2.  Took advil.  Two hours later all those symptoms were gone and did not return.  I have felt fine ever since. Arm is no longer sore, but redness still present, though seems to be lessening.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min. Within 5 mins, heat rose up to my head causing dizziness &amp; head spin. Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

                                                Hello, i took the Moderna 1/4 and am scheduled for 2nd shot 2/1. I just wanted to pass on some side effects and i did not go on the agency website which i should have to report them. I had a headache off and on the first week. the first day afterward i had a 100 degree fever as well. I never have sleep issues (falling asleep etc) i had insomnia and could not sleep and didnt sleep well for around a week. What i noticed most though is it really affected my stomach and i was awakened with acid reflux several times. the muscles of my stomach were sore like i had been coughing (but hadn&#39;t) and i had no desire for food, only fruit, light watery things. as soon as i eat anything i have stomach pain digesting. Since last weekend i sleep way too much, even if i set the alarm i turn it off and keep sleeping. I try to walk and get out.  when i wake up it seems my stomach has been really active, i have a horrible taste in my mouth and acid reflux liquid in my through.  Just letting you know; and I have the 2nd shot so fingers crossed i&#39;ll come through all of this. Take care as well. Thanks

                                                Adverse event: Face swelling especially the eyes (eye lids, tissue between nose and eyes and below eyes), lips and outside the lips (left upper lip and into cheek and lower right lip into chin). Note: I was not having any trouble breathing and I did not think my throat was closing up.  Treatment: Benadryl 50 mg immediately and again 4 hours later,  Allegra 180mg once daily for 7-10 days, Methylprednisolone 4mg Dospak 21S, Famotidine 20mg 1 twice/day for 10 days. Outcome: Spoke to MD about 8PM on 1/19/21; took first dose of Benadryl and Allegra about 8:20PM; MD called in other Rxs and I had to pick them up, so first doses of methylprednisolone and famotidine were taken around 9:05PM; around 10PM or a bit after MD checked on me and I said I thought the lip swelling was improving but it was hard to tell with the eyes; MD had previously instructed me to stay up to 12:30PM in order to take the second dose of Benadryl 50mg, which I did and then I went to bed. In the morning around 9AM, I thought the face swelling had gone down 40-50%. MD called me around 9:16AM and I reported to her that the swelling had gone down 40-50%.  At 10:36PM tonight as I make this report, my swelling as gone down more maybe by an additional 10 or 15%.

                                                I woke up Saturday morning and both eyeballs were hurting. I had sensitivity to all light.  Hurting felt like a migraine in the front of my forehead. Pain with touch when washing my face or applying a cool compress.  Took Tylenol and it did not improve the pain.

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

Note I could feel what felt like bumps under the skin vs. above the skin or that they could be seen.   Due to providing support services to a disabled brother at his home during this evening, I did not take any benadryl  or any related medication.  I used cool compress at the site and called my husband to give him an alert.  I had both a landline phone and a mobile phone (which has a medical alert service at the push of 1 button that I could talk to/or that would automotically respond) as I was aware to watch for breathing difficulties...I experienced none.  I alerted our school system nurse about the issue the next morning and she guided me to contact my PCP which I did.  I could not be seen that day, but was no worse regarding symptomes and knew I needed to go to ER or a Urgent Care if anything worsened  which it didn&#39;t.  Around 5 p.m. on Friday evening when I was able  to be at my own home I took 1 dose of benadryl (allergen/dye free), drank alots of liquids and rested.  During Saturday I still felt effects of benadryl, but vaccine related things cleared up.  Monday,  1/25 7:15 a.m. to 7:45 a.m. while at home working on my computer, my left eye vision became very distorted like my vision was jumping around/unfocused...no issues of this before and I am not prone to headaches such as migraines..I was getting concerned that I might need to call work that I could not come as was afraid to drive and it cleared up.  Note:  I have routinely gotten many types of vaccines due to working in the medical field and needed to care for at risk family members (flu, phenmonia (sp), shingles, hepititis, tetnus, booster for other preventive illnesses) and have never had adverse reactions.  I do plan to get the second dose of the Moderna vaccine as I work for a school system and am primry care giver for a medical and disability comprimised younger brother.

                                                Developed a ?scalded mouth? sensation in tongue and on roof of mouth. It was burning like raw and inflamed. Throat felt very dry, though no airway issues at all. Took 25 mg Benadryl with relief in 30 min. It is currently 4 hrs since that dose and it feels like the sensation is beginning to recur.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

                                                The afternoon after I developed chills and had goose bumps all over.  I didnt have a fever but the chills went on for several hrs so I took 2 500mg tylenol and the chills ended around 5pm.  I developed a headache and still had to continue to drink plenty water because my mouth got that super dry feeling again.  I went home ate and relaxed until I fell asleep.  I had body aches and because my arm was hurting I couldnt lay on that side.  I took benedryl and tylenol before bed. Today I still feel very very tired, fatigued and my body still aches.  My arm is still really red, warm to the touch and has a nice knot at the injection site and the headache comes and goes.

                                                I received my shot on Friday Jan. 22,2021. Other than a sore arm no other symptoms until Monday morning at 10:30 when suddenly I had a very sore throat. As time passed it got worse and I had trouble swallowing and speaking but not breathing. I work for a dentist and he looked at my throat and my uvula and soft palate were very swollen and red. He referred me to my primary physician who saw me late that afternoon.  I had no other symptoms except pressure in my ears. My doctor gave me a steroid injection and put me on prednisone for 5 days and amoxicillin 500mg, 1 gram twice a day. About 3 hours later the swelling had gone down enough for me to eat some and talk better. By the next day things were much better. I really don?t know if this was a reaction to the vaccine or not but many people have told me to report it. My doctor wasn?t sure if it was that or a bacterial infection. He treated me for both to get the swelling down.

                                                I had extremely high blood pressure; my heart was throbbing. I was told to go to ER at work but I didn&#39;t and went home and rested. That went on for days. I called my doctor and she put me on Metrozal to help with heart rate and BP and that brought that back down again. I&#39;m taking this every day now in addition to my other blood pressure medicine. It has helped.  I had headaches; I had terrible dreams and couldn&#39;t sleep. My eyes turned all dark - like when you need to drink water (underneath eyes). Had a terrible thirst. I drink water constantly.  I had bruising on various parts of my body - legs; arms etc. It&#39;s calmed down with all these symptoms within a couple of weeks.

Since then my tongue and throat feel like they are trying to swell. I took some Benadryl. I feel like bronchitis and it is like I get winded easy. I have a crawfish allergy  and my throat feels the same as when I eat crawfish.  I called my doctor today and she did video visit with me at 11:30 and said if I keep feeling like this to go to the ER.

Later sometime in the middle of the night, I wasn&#39;t able to fall asleep as if I&#39;d had a stimulant, and had intense arm pain where shot given, some nausea, some intestinal discomfort, intense pain at temples and behind eyes, overall &#34;crappy&#34; feeling.  Sun., Feb 14, 3rd day after shot: Pains/symptoms same as above with the addition of a low grade fever (99.9), chills, fatigue, no appetite. Tylenol didn&#39;t help. Was able to drift in and out of light sleep. Later in the day, fever and majority of symptoms suddenly &#34;left&#34;,  gradually decreasing until I felt fine again by Sunday evening. No issues Monday, Feb. 15.

                                                I started experiencing chills within half an hour after the shot.  The following 24 hours I experienced total insomnia, chills, headache, body ache, shoot pains, extreme weakness, and nausea.  Insomnia lasted 3 nights.  The other side effects began to decrease after 24 hours, but still prominent enough to prevent from actively engage in anything for another 24 hours.  After the third night of insomnia, I thought I had turned the corner.  But I continued to experience headache (I basically never have headache), occasional nights of insomnia (I usually sleep extremely well), and low level of nausea, and fatigue.  Today, 8 days after the shot, after another night of difficulty in sleeping, I woke up with the same headache behind my right eye, nausea, weakness, and fatigue.  This is when I thought to report these side effects.

Then moved to all my cervical neck bones.  This all took place within 30 min after injection.  Once home started to ache all over.  Started with low grade fever of 99.7 and eventually till it got to 101.4  I did not take any medication.  Just let it run its course.  Upon waking up this morning my left eyeball has a busted blood vessel in it and looks bad.  But as day goes on, it is slightly fading.  I am no feeling fine.

                                                approx 4 hrs post injection, headache and moments of &#34;hot flash&#34; type events.  Looked at numbers on my fit bit, and even though I was sitting at my desk, exerting no excessive energy, my heart rate read 96 bpm (lasted for about 10-15 min).    As the day progressed I began to feel more blah. That evening, I took bandaid off injection site and it was patchy read and raised skin, warm to touch, and the areas where the bandaid was were raised and patchy (I have never had a reaction to bandaids before).  As night progressed, I became excessively chilled and could not get warm.  Would occasionally have a &#34;hot&#34; moment and then return to chilled where I couldn&#39;t get warm enough.  Body aches, headache, and chilled through the night. Second day, totally consumed with body aches, chilled, headache, tired and weak feeling. Took Tylenol.  Slept on and off through the day. Second evening  awoke around 8pm and everything still hurt, including my teeth.  Took Tylenol, tried to eat a few crackers- no appetite. Went back to bed. Third morning feeling 90% better. Still have headache. Took Tylenol.

                                                Twenty minutes after receiving the vaccine I noticed my ears began to feel odd as I was driving home.  Within the hour after the vaccine I had significant tinnitus in both ears and felt pressure/discomfort in both ears and had trouble hearing at normal volume.  I expected this to be temporary and was not initially concerned.  About 90 minutes after the injection I developed a strong headache.  It lasted several hours and then was intermittent but ended at about 24 hours.  The morning after the vaccination I was surprised to still have tinnitus upon waking, along with pressure that at times was painful.  I also realized that I was having even more trouble hearing.  For example I had to turn my car radio, my television, and my other electronic devices up several levels and had a hard time understanding conversations in person.  It has now been 19 days and the ear symptoms have continued.

                                                Should I be seeking medical attention?   Initially had itching for a few minutes, along with arm pain.  Quickly developed headache on right side of head.  Right side of neck, face, lip, arm, and right upper torso ached and felt tingly, like the feeling you get when a dentist gives you novacaine.  This accompanied dizziness which subsided after 10 minutes.  I was examined at the site and vitals were deemed okay.    Over the course of the day, the headache lessened and the torso lost the numbing feeling.  I had a knot at the injection site which gradually went down when I put heat on it. The only residuals I am feeling 22 hours later is numbness in the lip, and of course, my arm aches.  The numbness is aggravating, and I wonder how long it will last.

                                                Headache began early afternoon and gradually the pain increased through the remainder of Friday March 5,2021 and lasted through Saturday, March 6,2021 until about 6 PM where the pain subsided enough that I could function. As the pain intensified, I had throbbing pain in the temples and behind my eyes, the pain worsened even more if I bent forward, like to pick up something from the floor. My neck muscles were extremely tight. I couldn&#39;t concentrate on anything, like reading or working.  I was feeling less than energetic,. Also, my left arm was red, not swollen at the injection site and hurt to touch, not as bad as the 2 days after receiving the vaccine, but I thought it was unusual that my arm was red &amp; sore. This is what made me conclude it was a delayed reaction to the vaccine. I rarely have headaches and if I do  taking 2 Ibuprofen will take care of it. Taking 2 Ibuprofen this time did absolutely nothing to ease the pain.  I did increase to 800 mg of Ibuprofen late Friday and early Saturday which did help, used a cervical heating pad, hot shower to try to ease muscle tension. I was able to sleep and by Saturday evening with home remedies, the pain did subside and by Sunday March 7,2021 I felt back to normal with a slight, slight bit of headache but not much to worry about.

This started in the 11 a.m. hour. by 4 p.m. the bottom left side of the lip was swollen a good bit. By 5:30 p.m. my entire lip was completely swollen so much I looked like the character Bubba off of Forest Gump. By 6;30 p.m. it was beginning to harden on the left side of my face by the mouth. By 7p.m the right side of my face is hard and my face is red.  I did take pictures if you need me to send them to you . This morning swelling is down but not all the way. I have a picture from this morning the swelling is not as discomfort as yesterday but still is not back to normal.

Drank vitamin C 1000mg.   After 15 minutes I felt better.   About every 15 minutes there would be another wave of the same pains.   Then I would feel better and then another wave.   There were five waves.   After 1 1/2 hours, it stopped and I went home.   Later that night, I was very thirty, couldn&#39;t sleep and my kidneys were sore.   Next morning, I could not raise my arm from the pain.  Every day since, I have had another wave of the same pains once in the morning and then again in the evening.   Each wave lasted 1 to 2 hours.   I would sleep and afterwards felt better.  Saturday March 20th, the wave at night was the worst one and it lasted 3 hours.   The wave today March 21st, the wave was smaller and then I could sleep.   Today my arm is better, I could move it normally.

                                                About 14 hours after the injection I began running a high fever- the highest was 103. Along with severe body shaking, chills, body aches and pain, mild headache, earache, sore throat, coughing, and loss of emotional control. Used Tylenol and ice packs for the fever and pain. Took 4 hours to get things tolerable. Early Sunday morning I only had a slight headache, sore throat and earache-which are probably due to my seasonal allergies.

                                                No treatments initially. Big chills in the evening of March 20 and difficulty breathing, 100.7 F fever by morning, inability to even sit on March 21 so I stayed mostly in bed, nausea, headache, sore throat, altered taste (things tasted bitter and as chalk), strong body aches. I  understand that the fever was not high, so my extreme weakness and exhaustion were not really related to the fever. Fever subsided by March 22, but numbness on the whole  left side of head and body appeared  for about 2 hours in the evening - unpleasant and scary, but I did not seek intervention. Headache and nausea on March 23 and 24. Total inability to sleep on the night of March 23/24 (stabbing headache and nausea contributed to a lot of anxiety). Finally took Xanax in the morning of March 24, so I finally slept between 7:30 and 10:30am. I am writing this at 3:30 pm on March 24. I am much better compared with March 21, but still with a significant headache and some nausea.   I had Covid-19 in the first half of November. Post-vaccine symptoms were similar to my covid symptoms, but quick. In December I got post-covid a-fib and was diagnosed with heart failure. Improved on medication, awaiting heart ablation in May 2021. I am concerned that with the strong reaction I felt  after the first dose, my reaction after the second dose may be even worse than that on March 21.

The vision issues have increased the MS Optic Nuritis problems, loosing vision in right eye!  But its the headaches I can&#39;t stand.  They come and go, and sometimes its sooo bad that I can&#39;t move my head and body.  Sitting in the dark helps.  Thus having MS and lowered immune system has the headaches causing me to be immobile during episodes, sometimes lasting only an hour, sometimes all day!   And chills, but not as bad as the headaches.  I don&#39;t want to lose my vision again due to having to do these vaccines every year with these side affects.

                                                Started approx 80 minutes after injection with soft palate swelling and throat fullness, followed by change in voice, and chest tightness with paresthesias. Went directly to ED. Sats  were good, no wheeze, throat swelling was noted. BP initially 150/93, peaked at 189/93,. Was 148/67 at discharge. Received oral Benadryl and Zyrtec, IV dexamethasone and Pepcid. ECG was done, no other labs. Observed for approx 90 minutes with improvement of all symptoms. Did need to take additional Benadryl dose approx 5 hours after first dose for return of mild throat fullness and rising BP. Both resolved within 30 minutes of dose. No further throat symptoms, BP fluctuations for over 24 hours now

And eyes started feeling puffy especially my left one but when I looked in the mirror nothing was swollen.  About 30 minutes later I took a Benadryl.   It started feeling better but the sensation took about 24 hours to go away totally on my face and a few hours later for my eyes to feel normal.

                                                Approximately 20 to 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I had what appeared to be a seasonal allergic reaction, in which I could not stop sneezing and my eye tearing.  This continued throughout the evening and night but not as intense as when it first began.  I awoke at 1:00 AM to a very intense sneezing and eye tearing, but on only the left side of my face and eventually both sides.  I took Allegra D and did get relief.  The sneezing (allergic rhinitis) reaction continued but after almost an hour of taking the Allegra D , it was not as intense.  My face also appeared swollen but only with respect of atypical allergic rhinitis intense reaction.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

The next day  Friday was better but still body aches and a slight headache.  My injection sight started turning red and the red rash moved down my arm. Still tired but better, symptoms letting up.

                                                Well, it was first facial tingling on the left side (same side as shot)  but it gravitated in a more pronounced (and a little bit scary) way around the outer arch of my left eye socket. I started to massage it to just get it whatever it was moving and circulating. Then I figured it might be a good idea to get up and rotate my arm a little and jump around. This actually helped. The tingling and very slight numbness subsided after about three hours but today, a full 29 hours later, my left eye is twitchy. It&#39;s not a huge deal. I was in bed most of the day anyway but a nurse friend of mine said I should still responsibly report this.

                                                I felt anxious after the shot, but that night felt ok. Morning was another story. I woke up with pain in my muscles from the waist down and found it difficult to walk. My eyes started to hurt. I had blurred vision. Around 2:00 I went by the mirror and saw that my eyes were blood red. I laid down and rested. About 2 hours later I got up the most of the redness was gone but then I had a headache.  The next  morning a persistent cough and the sneezes started.  The headache would return every time that I coughed or sneezed. It was very painful- as if someone hit me with a hammer.  Even though the pain only lasted a few minutes, it hurt a lot. I sneezed and cough a lot. Finally, Sunday morning I was walking better; however, I felt I had the flu. Normally, I would have gone in and got ready for a sub, but I wasn&#39;t able to. I rested on the couch. Then took a 2 hour nap. Finally, I felt better around 6 pm except for the painful headache that returned every time I coughed or sneezed. It has been a week. I thought the worse would be over by now. I guess I will have to go in and talk to my doctor on Monday because the sneezes and coughs are still quite painful. When will it end?

The left muscle in my left side of my neck stiffened.  As we left the area and headed down the street I was getting anaphalactic:  numb jaw, swelling tongue, closed throat, eyes closing, inner cheeks numb - as if I was severely novacained from the dentist.  I was able to breathe ok to  get home hoping it would pass and drank wanter to keep things fluid.  I was there for one hour.  On advice, I went to the ER to get checked out.

My brain felt compromised in it&#39;s thought process struggling to think straight 30 minutes into receiving shot. Eyelids felt so heavy . I struggled to hold my eyes open but could not. Fell into a 3 hour deep sleep. Woke up feeling foggy brained &amp; clumsy.  At 3am the next day my throat felt thick &amp; dry with difficulty swallowing.  Went to ER at 3:30. Was told my tonsils were swollen. I did not have a sore throat.  Dr tested for strepp throat with negative result. I was given a shot of benedryl &amp; an oral Allegra pill. Symptoms began to subside &amp; I was sent home. Nasty headache &amp; wobblyness continued through the day &amp; into the following day. Started feeling better Sunday night

                                                Vaccinated at 1:20 PM on 1/26/2021. Approximately 15 min later I was in the waiting area, the nurse had been pre-notified to watch me for allergic reaction . In 15 minutes my symptoms were fast heart rate, lips burning, dark red facial flushing, ears flushing, and anterior neck flush, body tremors, a rapid response team notified to evaluate me. I was administered a 25 mg  Benadryl tablet per mouth.  I felt stabilized and chose to go to the ER within the building for further evaluation.  Remaining stabilized, had a 4 hour wait until I was seen by emergency staff. My treatment was Solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25 mg po. I was placed on a heart monitor and a pulse oximeter to check my oxygen levels the entire time I was in the ER. 4 hours prior to being seen by the ER doctors I had a CBC, a BMP blood work, and an EKG. After medications were administered I was observed approximately 1.5-2 hours. I was discharged with a 5 day medicine regimen to follow. Prednisone 40 mg per day; Pepcid 40 mg per day; Benadryl 25 mg every 6 hours. On 1/27 I chose to take the Benadryl 25 mg only because I had received the Pepcid and Prednisone the previous night late. On the 28th I took the medicine as prescribed but only took Benadryl every 12 hours. I felt Benadryl 4 times a day would not be handled well with my body. On 1/30 I was able to take the Pepcid and Prednisone but had to discontinue the Benadryl due to waking up with a spinning sensation upon opening eyes and a loss of equilibrium upon walking. I completed my medicine regimen on 2/1. Today 2/2 I woke up with symptoms of watery eyes, flushed face, mild facial itching, after drinking one cup of full caffeine coffee developed an increased heart rate and nervousness, was medicated with Benadryl 25 mg po at 10:00 AM along with my blood pressure medicine and potassium. Also at that time my blood pressure was 150/80. Three hours later my blood pressure had come down to 130s/60s but felt extreme weakness and felt the need to lay down and rest with legs elevated.  I continue with my day with increased heart rate with activity, so I have remained inactive for the rest of the day.   Also on 6:00 AM on 1/27 I was awakened with a heart rate In the 160s, I called 911, paramedics came 5 minutes later. On arrival my heart rate had instantly went down to the  112-120 range. The paramedics explained they have been treating COVID patients and have seen this a lot, we discussed going to the hospital but I felt I was stabilized and didn&#39;t need further treatment.   Also upon discharge from ER visit they had me get 2 epi-pens and I now have 2 epi-pens available at home.

                                                A day after 1st dose, experienced pain, right arm swollen &amp; hot at injection site &amp; about 10&#34; below site. Continued x 5 days., eventually calmed down and went away.  On Jan. 23 woke up in night to arm discomfort and itching, Jan.24 arm was swollen, hot &amp; red, about 10-12&#34; site. It continued for 4-5 days. 2nd reaction didn&#39;t hurt as much. Also noticed HA &amp; fatigue, light swelling of upper lip. Took Claritin D &amp; lip swelling resolved. Phone consult with organization physician. On 1/28/21, much better, little red and hot. I feel fine. 2nd vaccine scheduled 2/12/21.

                                                1) The right portion of my lower lip started to swell on Tuesday (Feb2) or Wednesday (Feb3); I don?t remember which day. It?s been getting a little worse every day, including today (Friday). I?ve been regularly putting petroleum jelly on my right, lower lip to relieve the discomfort. I?ve also been putting petroleum jelly all over my lower and upper lips, because both lips have become unusually dry since the swelling began.  2A) Part of my skin (near the needle?s point of entry on my arm) came off when I removed band-aid at end of my shower on Tuesday (Feb2) morning.  The narrow, skin-missing area on my arm is a little less than the size in length of the width of the band-aid that I removed. (I have a photo if you?d like to see it.) Although I turned shower water off before removing the band-aid, that raw skinless part of my arm started to sting and burn profusely, immediately after I removed band-aid. The steam (not water) from the shower stall is what burned so badly. When looking in mirror to investigate source of pain, I was puzzled as to why my skin was missing.   2B)Wednesday (Feb3) morning, my husband attempted to put Neosporin on that small portion of my skinless arm to prevent infection from setting in. But it was so painful, I had to stop him. The area burned for more than an hour. So now I keep the band-aid on that spot and don?t remove it. It?s still very sensitive, and I feel discomfort while taking a shower. But since I leave band-aid on, it doesn?t burn and sting like before. And It wasn?t until Thursday (Feb4), after looking online at missing skin, that I realized that my skin apparently came off when I removed the bandage. I also read, when looking online, that skin removal with bandages can happen more often with older folks like myself. I?m not sure if this is an adverse reaction to the vaccine or not but thought I?d report it just in case.

Redness continued to spread toward inner part of ear for about 30  more mins.   Woke with redness on 2/4.   I applied topical Benadryl on 2/4 and 2/5.  Redness resolved on 2/6. Other sides effects on 2/3:  soreness at injection site, chills during night and difficulty sleeping.  Took 1 Tylenol at 5:30 pm and 1 at 11:59 pm.      Side effects on 2/4 : low grade fever (99.2 - 2&#43; degrees for me), fatigue, general feeling of un-wellness.   All resolved by 2/5 except red ear, and fatigue which continues mildly today 2/7.

Symptoms resolved within 20 minutes, observed for a few extra minutes then went home.

At about 4 hours after I smelled smoke and dirty dish rag smell. That didn&#39;t last. Other symptoms started 12 hours after given shot. It was immediate like turning on a light switch. I slept until 5:30 the next day, 2/3/2021. Was able to eat a bit of soup and went back to sleep until next morning. I was able to go to work on 2/4/2021 but experienced some weird brain fog and fatigue. On 2/5/2021 my arm had a large red ring around injection site and hives below it. I remained fatigued and lack of appetite for 4 days or so.

                                                Just a couple of minutes after the COVID-19 vaccine, my whole face and tongue started tingling and was a strange  numbing feeling throughout my face. It started getting better after about 30 minutes. However, the left side near my jaw felt numb through the evening and my tongue was still tingly feeling. Today (the day after the vaccine) my tongue feels more like a burn. Worried about taking the 2nd dose after such a strange feeling  from this first dose.

Lasted about a day. # Midweek,as I  reported. about the wed after receiving  first dose friday AM,  I started having dry mouth and extremely dry lips, and  continuous thirst. Didnt have to drink much, but continued recurring over the course of  one and a half to 2 weeks, until finally disappeared. I was advised by one of my physicians to put real lemon juice on tip of tongue to stimulate the salivary glands.That really helped. did hear that this happened to several other patients.

This was  accompanied by a prickling sensations.  I got a sore inside my right nostril and a cold sore on right upper lip.  The mottling and vein prominence continue intermittently still.  Improving but not resolved entirely. Along with this, my eyes became intermittently  itchy as if I had an allergic irritation. This has also completely resolved.  I spoke with a relative who is a physician  and he felt that I may have had a hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis reaction.

                                                Within minutes of the shot, my face turned bright red and felt flushed, I developed a headache, and my tongue swelled slightly. I did not have any breathing difficulties. The reaction peaked about an hour after the shot, and by two hours after the shot the reaction had completely subsided. It was a slight reaction, with no medical emergency and no lasting effects, but it was definitely an allergic reaction. My primary care physician, Dr  has advised me to not get the second dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Nearly  continuous headache behind the eyes since the evening of vaccine shot (11 days as of current date). Sometimes dull throb, sometimes sharp pain usually on left side (same side as vaccine shot). Sensitivity to light. When pain is sharper causes indigestion and nausea. Pain goes away if I take  ibuprofen, but always returns and persists overnight. I don&#39;t like taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen more than once a day or for continuous days. Acupuncture worked for a short time. Affects my ability to concentrate and work on computer or watch TV. What other natural treatment will help? How much longer will this last?

I didn&#39;t vomit, although I felt the slight urge.   I slept during the day and it helped.  The next day I was  fine. I thought the medicine was strong. This happened two weeks after the 1st dose.

She said her lips became swollen and very chapped.  Also, her tongue lost the sense of taste in the front but it was ok in the middle.  She has sought treatment with an ENT physician and her primary physician but feels they have not helped her.  She says she is still not back to normal.  She is going to consult with an allergist at my suggestion.

Nest day was okay-just a little dizziness. Third day brought on more symptoms: eyes burning,  little dizziness, neck hurt and I had a feeling like the flu ~ spaciness in my head and Very tired...stayed in bed all day. Next five days were normal. Then on following Wed (a week after the shot) a rash or hives formed around the injection area -was itchy. I felt sleepy &amp; my head had a spaciness again. Stayed in bed all day, napped and this lasted about 10 hrs. This morning I feel better but very dizzy. And the 4&#39; circle around injection is still noticeable.

                                                I received the Moderna COVID-19 first shot  vaccination at 11:00am  on  Thursday, 3/4/21.  The next day,  Friday, 3/5/21,  at about 10:00am, I experienced chills and muscle fatigue that lasted until  bedtime about 11:00pm.  Life returned to normal until yesterday, 3/8/21,  when, beginning around 11:00pm and lasting until 11:00pm bedtime,  I experience body chills similar to 3/5/21.  Today,  Tuesday,  3/9/21, when I awoke at 6:00pm, my heart rate was noticeably elevated but stabilized within 15 minutes.  And about 10:55am, as I was focusing on work (reviewing/editing an electronic document), I  had an unusual blurry vision and mentally spacious experience that lasted for less than 2 minutes but required me to halt work and collect my thoughts. These experiences are completely new to me.

                                                Patient had her first dose of Moderna vaccine admistered at approximately 1315 on 3/4/2021. She waited the 15 minutes as recommended and had no symptoms or concerns. She left our suite and stopped off at the restroom before she left for work and noticed that her face and nose was reddened when she took off her facial mask. She returned to our site at approximately 1340/1345 and was brought back to an exam room. At this time she complained of slight lip tingling. Dr. was asked to assess patient. No difficulty swallowing or breathing, HR 82, pulse ox 99%. No facial swelling. Glass of water offered and patient finished without any concerns. Dr. ordered 25 mg of Benadryl (patient was going to work ). She was monitored until 1430 and then  discharged at approximately 1440. No localized reaction at injection site noticed. Patient went to work and was fine until the Benadryl wore off-she did take an addtional 25 mg of Bendadryl. Upon awaking the next day 3/5/2021, her facial area was swollen and slightly reddened. She was instructed to call her PCP. Patient continued to take Bendadryl, and by Sunday 3/7/2021 she was back to baseline.

Told people at clinic.  They said to sit for another 15 minutes and come and get them if it got worse.  I went back after ~ 30 minutes total and a couple of medical assistants took my blood pressure.  It was  178/158 (normally I run 128/ 68).  They asked me to take my inhaler (Advair was all that I had so I took a dose).  In addition they gave me one Benadryl tablet (25 mg). 1 hour 20 minutes later my heart rate was 157/124 they gave me another Benadryl to take on my way home if I needed it. *** When I got to my home 30-40 minutes away.  I called my internist. I spoke with her nurse and they called back and told me to take my second dose of 25 mg Benadryl.  She told me to take 25 to 50 mg of Benadryl one hour before getting my second dose of Moderna vaccine.  I had significant swelling on the injection site 3-4 inches in diameters that went down after 5-6/days.  Vaccine # 2 - I received my second dose of Moderna 2/19/2021.  I took 25mg Benadryl ~ 30 minutes before vaccine and took the additional 25 mg when I returned home.  I was extremely cold and could not get warm for 48 hours I took Tylenol. There was no fever. I had wheezing. Swelling day #1 was 1-2 inches Days 2-5 swelling was 4-5.5 inches in diameter. Five to seven days later the swelling and pain resolved.

Swollen tongue and lots of drainage down back of throat with metallic taste, and then a sore mouth and throat.   This lasted 3 -4 days.  did treat with 1 benadryl  each night for  2 nights in a row.   and tyneol in the day.  Swollen tongue was not so I couldn&#39;t breathe but just hurt and &#34;felt big&#34; in my mouth with many bumps where it rested against my front teeth.   itching and small rash on the arm that got the shot (not at the site) (3 to 4 days on this and benadryl helped). and of course a sore arm just for a day.

                                                Within 5 hours, patient was awakened from her nap but found that her eyes were swollen shut, upper lip was swollen and her gums itched.  Her head was hurting which is what awakened her.  She went and looked in the mirror, she immediately took a Benadryl 25 mg oral gel cap.  Within 20 minutes, the swelling and itching started to improve.  The symptoms resolved after taking the Benadryl.  The next day, she went to work.  She took another Benadryl at 10 AM on Friday, slept all day.  She ran errands on Saturday, took a Benadryl with her just in case.  She also carried an Epi pen.  Her feet began to swell, her hands swelled and she started itching all over.  Her throat began to close.  She took a Benadryl immediately (this is day 3).  The symptoms did resolve.   She returned home.  On day four, she had some nausea.  On day five (Monday), she went to work and her tonsils started throbbing.  She ran her bus driver route.  She was itching all over again.  She took another Benadryl . She called Dr. on day 5 after vaccination because of the recurring symptoms.  She also called her allergist.  She had an appointment with her allergist on day 6.  Family Doctor also called back on Day 5 and called a prescription in for Prednisone.  She did not start the Prednisone.  She did see the allergist on day 6. The allergist thinks her reaction might have been due to the preservative in the Moderna product.  It was the only ingredient in both the flu shot (7 years ago) and the Moderna contents.  She advised her to take the Prednisone dose pack (as prescribed by family doctor) to over-ride and she upped her Zyrtec to bid.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included two time cancer survivor . Concomitant medications reported included Carvedilol for high blood pressure, acetamide for cholesterol, potassium, multivitamins, zinc, calcium, Vitamin D.  On 05 Feb,  prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 031L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Patient was ok at midnight, but when they woke up, they felt very dizzy, were vomiting that day, and experienced extreme tiredness for 3 weeks, now they feel relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired, probably related to not been able to eat on account of having very limited appetite. They mentioned they had limited bowel function, and their bladder felt full, like they could not empty it. Patient states they had a dry mouth from  the beginning of the symptoms.  After a week of these symptoms, on Saturday, the patient went to a clinic and they did some bloodwork and found that the liver enzymes were elevated and 5 more values were not normal and that their kidney function was not normal.  They consulted with their oncologist and they believed these could be an extreme immune response to the vaccine, since the lab work conducted on the 23Dec2020 was normal.  Last Friday they have some blood tests and the values were back to normal.  Treatment for the events included paracetamol and ibuprofen alternating; and  Prednisone.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, dizziness, vomiting, fatigue, dry mouth were relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired.  The outcome events,  urinary retention,  decreased appetite,   and limited bowel function are unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Very weak for few days, no appetite. On Thursday 3/11 relapsed with blurry vision around 10 AM, dizziness, intense headache, nausea, vomiting, freezing cold with noticeable body shaking. This was as bad as Sunday and lasted most of the day into early evening. Felt worse than any flu I&#39;ve ever had. Today (3/14) is best I&#39;ve felt since Sunday (3/7).

                                                On Monday evening, I started feeling rather weird, rather out of it. During the night, I was having trouble sleeping and woke up with a fever of 100. I took Tylenol and went back to bed.  When I finally got up probably around 10 a.m., I was not feeling well at all.  I had body aches, a headache, stomach cramps, chills, fever, my arm was very sore, very tired, and exhausted. I fell back asleep early afternoon and woke up with a 101.7 fever. Took Tylenol &amp; continued to not feel well.  Went to bed around 10 p.m. and slept for 12 hours.  Wednesday, I was still very exhausted, but not as many body aches. That evening, I noticed my face had many small pimples on it.  The next morning, I woke up with a rash and redness around the injection area, a rash on my face and on other areas of my body, which caused itching/tingling sensations.  I called the health department nurse and she indicated that the rash was also a side effect of the vaccine.  She suggested Benadryl, but I mentioned that I don&#39;t handle that medication very well.  I did use some Benadryl cream on my arm for the itching.  Not sure whether the cream caused a reaction, but I once again became very tired and took a nap.  I also developed a stuffed, clogged left ear, which affected my hearing.  This sensation came and went several times from Thursday through Sunday. On Friday, I still had a rash and experienced some fatigue.  When I woke up on Saturday, I finally felt like I was &#34;normal&#34; again.

                                                About 4 hours after receiving my second Covid vaccination, I began to experience chills. Several hours later, achiness began. I went to bed and by morning I felt so sick I could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I slept for most of 14 hours, plus off and on all the next day. then all the next night. I tried not to take any over the counter medication because I had heard or read conflicting information as to the effect of these medications on the vaccine. However by 11:00 AM (just over 20 hours after vaccination) I couldn&#39;t stand it any more. I took 1 Tylenol. I began to feel slightly better such that I was able to get to the bathroom and get something to drink. However, I knew exactly when the Tylenol wore off 4 hours later. I took another Tylenol with a similar result. After sleeping all night, I didn&#39;t feel much better by the next morning. At 8:00 AM (just over 41 hours after vaccination) I took 1 ibuprofen. Within an hour, I started to sweat. Within an hour after that I started to improve. Buy the end of that day, I was feeling much better, however still fatigued. The fatigue lasted most of the next week. Please note, I returned to work (online teaching from home) the next day. This didn&#39;t help the fatigue situation.  Other symptoms I noticed included a second round of Covid Arm. The 2nd vaccine was injected into the opposite arm because I experienced Covid Arm in my left arm after my first injection - see Vaers Report Temporary Number dated 2/14/21. I received  my 2nd injection in the opposite arm. This time, the rash appeared much sooner - 3 days after injection, and went away much more quickly (2 days later). This rash was not as itchy, but was also not identical to the first rash. The first time the rash was blotchy and bumpy. The second time it was more of a slightly raised red square blotch. Pictures are available if needed.  Another significant symptom was an increase in congestion and nasal drainage prominent the night after the injection and lasting through the time I began to feel better. Finally, I noticed  a temporary change in taste. Foods I enjoyed before injection tasted super-sweet for about 5 - 6 days after injection. This has resolved.

However,  two days after the vaccine I developed a continuous dry, barking cough for about 12 hours.  At times I coughed so much I couldn&#39;t catch my breath and almost vomited.  I felt like I had phlegm in my throat but didn&#39;t.   I took a Mucinex,  had a hot shower, drank some rooibos tea,  ate some honey and lemon lozenges, and was fine the next morning.  It was similar to when my daughter was young and had a mild case of whooping cough

Also, throughout the night I had multiple occurrences of what I deemed extra heart beats.   I had extreme dry mouth and periods of feeling hot and cold.

Also some redness and itching both ears and scalp.  This progressed to jaw pain on both sides. Had bruise around injection site with a bit of pain, but on Day 10 had grapefruit-sized red swelling distal to injection site.  Began taking OTC antihistamine on Day 7 for eye swelling but swelling became more severe so went to Urgent Care center on Day 10. They recommended starting RX Prednisone 40 mg QD and RX Hydroxyzine 25 mg BID, to be started in a.m. on Day 11.  Eye swelling improved but is still present, with some itching, as of Day  18.  Redness and bruise on arm has resolved.

                                                I had been doing really well with my irritable bowel and stomach issues for several weeks, but, the rash on my neck was in a flair up.  I had some flairing  going on with my upper neck and back area and some burning in my upper legs.  I had gone to sleep on Wednesday night and around 3 A.M., I was awakened by a horrible burning sensation in my upper stomach, back, face, neck, and arms.  They felt like they were on fire inside! My left lower jawbone was hurting up around the front of my ear into my cheekbone underneath my left eye.   I took a terribly burning diaherra, chilling, and aching all over.  I could hardly stand to set straight up in a chair , let alone lay down.  This was terribly bad until around 8 or 9 A.M.  It eased up some and I slept for a couple of hours.  It came back intermittantly for the next four days and nights..So much worse at night.  Even though I have issues with burning sensations and diaherra, etc., I have never experienced anything of this magnitude before!  I am afraid whatever was in a flair up within me was magnified times over!

Rash is not as severe but the burning in the limbs, hands and feet still present but not as visible. Pain in abdomen, and chest, but no vomiting. Stopped taking the acid reducer only the Benadryl. Omega vitamins with vitamin D seemed to help stop the burning under the skin on Day 2 but not Day 3 Throat is raspy and voice has a different sound; lower and breaking up. Sleeping a lot

The tinnitus has not diminished but the dizziness is at manageable levels.

                                                Immediately I could taste a metallic salty taste in my throat. About 1 minute later my throat was burning and itching and I began coughing. The nurses put me in a room with another nurse, gave me cold water and watched me.  5 minutes later I began feeling dizzy and nauseated.  My throat seemed to settle a bit and I finally told them I felt good enough to leave about 45 minutes later.  Around 5 pm  my throat was still burning and throbbing, so I took a benedryl, claritin and a pecid. My head felt fuzzy.  I ate ice cream for dinner because my throat kept throbbing and I was still nauseated.  I went to bed at 6 PM and around 10 PM I woke up with my throat throbbing and burning and I ached all over as if I&#39;d been beaten in my sleep.  I considered using my epi pen, but took another claritin and Hydrocondone instead because I never had trouble breathing and my lips didn&#39;t swell.  The worst was the swollen, itchy, throbbing throat and body aches.  By morning my throat had cleared up, but the body aches and headaches, and fuzzy headed are still with me 10 days later. I feel permanently damaged by the vaccine.

                                                I noticed tinnitus approximately 1 week after the first shot. It was initially soft but became more noticeable as the weeks progressed. After the 2nd vaccine, it became more pronounced. It is bilateral, pulsatile. Initially I did not associate it with the vaccine and I am not sure if it is coincidental. Are there other reported cases?

                                                January 31 I noticed that my face was tender when I touched it near my left temple. I didn&#39;t really think anything about it until it became more and more painful. The area involved increased from the left temple to in front of the left ear and above the left jaw. I also noted some stiffness of my upper neck and shoulders. I took Tylenol and Motrin and it relieved the discomfort some (from 3/10 to 2/10 on pain scale). It was mostly painful when palpated. I woke this morning with most of the discomfort gone (less than 1/10 on pain scale). Could just feel it a small amount when palpated the left temple and in front on left ear. At no time have I had any visual disturbance. The pain was constant and elicited most with palpation and movement of the jaw.  No severe pain. Not sharp or burning. Mostly an ache and a bit of numb feeling.   There is still a bit of lingering discomfort with palpation now (the evening of 2/1/21)

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  For the first 8 days, I experienced no reaction to the vaccine.  On day 9, I developed a rash on my right arm surrounding the vaccination  site. I was also flushed and my eyes were red.  And, I experienced diarrhea.  I began taking Benadryl 25mg  every 4 hours during the day (and took zolpidem only at night). In the subsequent 4 days, In addition to the rash, I experienced minor headaches and body aches (not unusual with my Fibromyalgia) so I added Tylenol 500 mg every 6 hours. The rash remained the same. Today is Day 5 and I awoke feeling better and the rash is the same size but not as vibrant. I used a cortisone cream on the rash today and only took Benadryl once when I began to feel lousy at the end of my work day.

Friday continued to feel the same sickness, nauseated, headache, off and on low grade temp and pain  in arms and upper back. I was taking 800mg Ibuprofen 3 times a day and it would ease off headache a little, but nothing  would stop for long.  I was just miserable. had heard the 2nd vaccine could cause such problems, but not the first...therefore, I am a little frightened of getting the 2nd vax. I tried to call the triage nurse at the VA to  ask her about it, but never could get thru to her.  Sent message saturday night to PCP, and was told to go to this website and put in info.

                                                Injection site pain a few hours following injection. About 7 hours after injection started feeling body aches and every bone in my body hurt. Teeth too. Felt like I had a sinus infection. Head and eye ached. Bad headache the next am. Took Tylenol at 10 am and felt better. Nothing more after that.  Just tested the remainder of the day.

Five days later a whelp appeared on the arm that was used down near my elbow  and my face was flush and blotchy...I took Benadryl and it subsided.  Ten days  later I woke up with redness, bumps that almost look like blisters.  swelling, and a warm arm near the injection site.

                                                I woke up the next morning with numbness in my right forehead which later progressed to mild numbness in my right face. Later in the day, the soreness in my head worsened and extended back from my forehead to top of scalp on right side. I had ear pain which made it difficult to drink liquids as it caused more pain.  This morning, I do not have the ear pain. Still have mild numbness on the right side of my face and the scalp soreness is still there, but less. No facial or mouth drooping at all. Said in next statement that I have not recovered yet since I still have the numbness, although rather mild.

I&#39;ve used tear drops, and will contact my ophthalmologist for an appointment.  After a while it gives me a headache.  The shot was given on my left arm, but the eye issues are just on the right side, the right eye.

                                                After approximately a half hour, I felt my left eye above the eye on the lid and the white part of my eye  begin to swell. After another half hour or so, I  could feel it swelling and it was noticable. I called my eye doctor and was advised  me on an over the counter eye drop.

Then I was OK. The whole incident lasted around thirty minutes.

Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

We gave her ice for the back of her neck.  We checked her blood pressure, it was 230/130, pulse was within normal limits.  Pulse ox was low.  An ambulance was called.  She removed her mask and stepped back so that she could breath better and her oxygen and coloring improved.  She said that her lips felt numb, so we gave her some benadryl just in case.  We did not give an epi pen due to her increased blood pressure.  Her blood pressure did start improving but was still high when the ambulance came.  They took her to the ER for evaluation and she will be following up with her pcp also.  The hospital felt that it was just a fainting episode.

                                                The day following the vaccine I was fine until approximately 1:30 p.m. when I suddenly got very, very dizzy, had disequilibrium and began to feel nauseous, and had diarrhea.  The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

It was challenging to stand on my own, extreme light-headedness, blood pressure wasn&#39;t taken until March 6th. The symptoms were the worst on March 4th, they improved over the past day or so, however when taking blood pressure reading on March 6th, 2021, blood pressure was 110/60 at 8 am, so it is highly indicative that blood pressure was even lower in the previous days.

I shopped in the store for 15 minutes ( there were no vacant chairs for me to sit in for the 10 minutes waiting period) . I purchased items and my receipt is marked 12:24 PM. the vaccinator told me I could leave at 12:23PM. I began driving home and about 10 minutes later I left my tongue getting puffy. I know this because I could not feel my teeth with my tongue. I took deep breaths to calm myself. I could breathe OK and looked for a place to pull over. After 5 minutes or so, my tongue felt normal again. No other problems since then .

                                                At 2:30 am on Friday 3/5/21 my left jaw started hurting and my lips started developing extremely fever blisters completely around my mouth and on my lips. I developed a rash on my right hand, left thumb, left hand, and forehead. I have a 1.25&#34; lump in a lymph node under my left chin. I went to an Urgent Care on 3/6 and they surmised that I was having a reaction to one of the meds I&#39;ve been on for years. On Monday 3/8/21, I went to my dermatologist and she&#39;s telling me NOT TO GET THE SECOND SHOT, because of the severe allergic reactions I&#39;m having to the FRIST SHOT.  I&#39;ve been taking steroids, doubled up on my Valacyclovir to 1000 MG/day until these outrageous fever blisters are gone and cleared up. The blisters were up to one inch x 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch. The dermatologist has me putting Aquaphor on my lips and rashes. She gave me a shot of Kenalog 80 MG. She says the lump will take over six months to go away!!!!!!!!!!! I&#39;m absolutely terrified to get the second shot and don&#39;t want to die. MORE IMPORTANTLY, what do I do now to indicate that I&#39;m fully vaccinated if I can?t take the second shot?????

                                                Had significant tooth pain about 14 hours after vaccine.  Toothache coincided with sleeplessness, injection site pain and headache. All symptoms but toothache cleared within 2 days, continued taking Advil for tooth pain and salt water rinse.   Already had dental referral to evaluate ongoing sensitivity to hot/cold but sensitivity turned into constant ache.  Have dental  on Thursday, March 11.  May simply be coincidence but today - four days following vaccine - tooth pain is much decreased.

                                                woke up in middle of night to my ears itching severely, again few minutes late. Then my hands and arms started itching. I got up and to see what was going on. My fingers had hives on the and the hives/rash had started down both arms from my hands to my elbows.  I immediately started taking a homeopathic remedy Apis. I took four doses within 6 minutes of each other, then another dose half hour later and another dose an hour later. the itching had stopped but the hives were still there. I sat up for another hour and then went back to bed. at 6 am the hives were much lighter and completely gone 2 hours later.  I had a hard lump at the injection site that stayed for a couple of days.  On March 3 my arm started hurting again with a much larger hard lump and a red hot spot on it. I put ice on it several times a day.  After 3 days it was only a small lump.

                                                Noticed my eyes were completely dilated and felt dizzy. After about an hour of noticing eyes, I started to feel really funny in my chest with pressure, dizziness blurry vision, racing heart.  I checked blood pressure and it was 220/110. I tried to lay back and it felt worse. At the same time I was nauseated and felt like I was going to have diarrhea and vomit at the same time.  Started with severe vomiting and chills that felt more like tremors than chills. The vomiting stoped during the night but my blood pressure stayed elevated for three days starting around 180/110 to 180/100. Finally it slowly came down to around 150/90 for two more days.  Then back to normal at 130/80.

                                                Hello,  FYI: My first Moderna vaccination I had a sore arm and fatigue for a day. For my second Moderna vaccination it was at 0745 6 Mar 2021. Twelve hours later side effects began. The first night was brutal. Temperature rapidly rose to 102. Joint aches, fatigue but couldn&#39;t sleep due to the pain, loss of taste and smell, nausea, felt real cold, shakes, congestion, gassy, hurt to breath, headache, shallow breathing, slightly elevated heart rate. I drank a lot of water and hot Green Tea.  I did call the medical center and spoke with a nurse about whether it was Covid or side effects to the second vaccination.  Second day was miserable; I still had a fever that gradually went down. Finally was able to sleep end of second day. I continued to drink a lot of water and hot Green Tea. Third day, still fatigued, mild heachach. Mild sore arm for three days.  Third through  nine days I have a below normal temperature, hoarseness, mild headache, and fatigue.  the medical center gave me annual flu vaccinations. I&#39;ve never had a side effect from them. While I was in the medical center, before I was deployed overseas, the medical center gave me some dozen vaccinations. Again, no side effects from them.  I have never been around anyone who turned out later to have Covid 19 or tested positive for it.  I have never had the flu. I have had some four cases of a cold. Worst illness was after my exposure to norovirus. I was gravely ill, had to be admitted to the hospital here. Norovirus worse than the two cases of food poisoning I had.  I figure with those awful side effects I now have an immune system better able to handle Covid 19 if I do get exposed.  Per CDC, I will still wear a mask, social distance, avoid medium- and large-sized crowds, avoid poorly ventilated public and private spaces, and wash my hands frequently for the forseeable future.

Didn&#39;t eat for 3 days, and was not hungry.  Had to force myself to drink and was  not thirsty.  3 days after initial fever had hearing loss.  Fever subsided after 5 days, nausea after the first day, vertigo after the second day, back pain became manageable after a week.  Hearing loss recovey after 5 days.

She noted a history of bee stings and that she has an epi pen at home so was given the shot and monitored for 30 minutes. 20 minutes post vaccine, patient noted she felt dizzy and somewhat disoriented. She noted a dry throat and like her arms and legs felt funny &#34;like jello&#34;. Her husband alerted staff at the vaccination site and EMS assessed her. She said she was told her blood pressure was high for her but otherwise vitals were fine. She denied itching, or shortness of breath or trouble breathing. She actually asked her husband to go home and get her epi pen and he returned with it and was given a dose of epi and sent to the local emergency room for evaluation. She said she felt better by the time she got their but was monitored for a number of hours. She felt completely fine by the time she was discharged. She noted for a few days following the vaccine she felt fatigued and a slightly itchy spot at injection site but that&#39;s it.

                                                About a week after my first shot on 2/18/21 I noticed a ringing in my ears. I checked for side effects and did not see it listed. I thought it was just a coincidence. I saw my oncologist and she said that it may be a sign of hearing loss. So I scheduled an upcoming hearing test and ENT visit. Then today I had my second shot and within an hour the ringing in my ears increased significantly. I did further research and found that their are others who have experienced the onset of tinnitus or worsening tinnitus after receiving the vaccine.

I felt the need to clear my throat several times.  This lasted about 20 minutes.  No other problems throughout the day until I went to bed that evening.  After laying down I experienced the metallic taste again.

The heaviness is felt in the  cheekbone area, the area below my left nostril, and down to my jaw on the left side of my face.

On the same day, I began to have difficulty with my vision , especially in the left eye, a headache and all my joints began to ache. I was also very tired. The symptoms progressively got worse  over the following two weeks and included a couple of episodes of heart rhythm irregularities . During the third week, the headache, eye issues and joint pain began to resolve but the tinnitus is debilitating and prevents me from mentally focusing or sleeping.

I was able to breathe.  It felt as if it was swollen, but I could not tell.  Today it feels much better/normal.  Should I get the second shot?

Pain felt like I was having a bursitis attack with a pain level of 7 out of 10.   Took two days to get to a &#34;2&#34;.   Did not sleep for two nights.  Extreme &#34;fogginess&#34; in head, numb feeling around nose, mouth and eyes.   Fatigue, depression, sadness .  Anxious feeling in the chest which is continuing as of this writing (3/21/21)   I do not take  any medications and do not have any history of depression or mental illness.   This is all very unusual for me.

The perfume scent is less prominent at times, but always there.

This happened 3 mornings in a row.  On 3/2/21 at 10pm I had a very severe ice pick headache. It felt like hot lava along top of right brain lasting 20 minutes. Took Advil. Called Clinic at 8am the next morning 3/3/21. I was able to get emergency appointment at 11am that day with Dr . He prescribed Gabapentin and Valtrex. Checked for Bells Palsy as right forehead was smooth. Medications helped. No more Ice Pick headaches but I?m still having headaches along the right brain. Pressure and pain behind my right eye. It has been almost a month now. I sadly had to cancel my second vaccine appointment.

I went back into the urgent care i had received the vaccine and they immediately took me to the ER. I was admitted and they gave me prednisone and benadryl and they gave me an epipen to take home. They sent me home and told me to use the epipen and call 911 if I couldn&#39;t breathe. My face was still swollen, red, and burning when I left the hospital. I still have the facial burning and swelling. I am putting cold compresses and taking benadryl. My neck and chest are also red and hot.

These symptoms went on for 2 weeks, until I had to do my routine lithium level on 3/18/21.  I was toxic at 1.7.  Have been on lithium 40 years and have never been toxic.  My doctor sent me to ER, where they gave me fluids and potassium.  When checked in ER, my BP was 214/87.  I never have high BP - 120/80 is normal.  On discharge, my BP was 194/79.  Saw my doctor ASAP on advice of ER.  My doctor put me on amlodipine for BP which I started today.  He said I had essential hypertension and heart rate is irregular.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

She was noted to have significant nongranulomatous anterior chamber reaction (2&#43; cell). There was no hypopyon or keratic precipitates. She was symptomatic with pain and light sensitivity in the right eye only. (Of note, the left eye was quiet. It had undergone cataract surgery and recently discontinued postoperative steroid drops). I discontinued the Tobradex and start Durezol drops every 2 hours. Of note, she has no history of uveitis. I saw her again 1/12/21 with complete resolution of the inflammation. She is currently tapering down on the topical steroid. I will see her again on 1/26/21 while taking Durezol 1x/day. This should be about 3 days from her second vaccination

By abour 6:30 swelling was increasing, Visited facility and Urgent Care where I was given Dexamethasone 10 mg injection IM. Prescribed Predisone 20 mg tablet x2 daily for 5 days. Most swelling resolved by Saturday morning, but slight swelling is presisting so far.

                                                Became light headed within approx 5 min. It got worse and walking to observation room felt faint. Pulse rate elevated but attendant said not &#34;critically high.&#34; Breathing was normal. After about 20 minutes I started feeling better. Oddly, while sitting in observation room, my sinuses cleared up, and I detected an odd taste at the back of my throat. Developed  frontal headache about same time; took acetaminophen and it went away after 12 hours.

                                                about 7 hours after injection, the site was sore and tingling. Throughput the evening, the tingling sensation progressed up the left side of my neck and my ear.  My ear felt similar s to Novacaine wearing off after a dental visit. During the night my throat got a similar sensation and created the need to try coughing it out. By 24 hours after the injection I was tired, with sore joints and muscle aches. By 36 hours I was still sleeping it off and at 48 hours I feel pretty well back to normal.

Had some tingling in lips and tightness in chest, felt light-headed.  Paramedics observed and checked vitals.  Pulse ox was good, chest clear, BP high.  Gave me choice of getting IV or going to drugstore and purchasing benedryl to begin immediately.  Started oral benedryl.  Went home and took 2nd dose.  Redness is subsiding, BP reduced. Still mild light headedness.

I then went outside and in 10 minutes my lips began to tingle and become numb.  In several more minutes the left size of my lips were very numb and the right size somewhat numb.  In just.a couple of more. minutes the location under my entire left jaw became somewhat numb and then I felt like I had something small in. my throat.  I asked  my husband to look at my face to notice and swelling, drooping, or was I slurring my words.  He said no.     I could breath and swallow ok so I sat in the car in case I got worst and needed to go back inside the health department.   I waited outside for one hour and 15 minutes (until 5;00) and during that time I improved significantly.    The next day a area under my left eye switched several times. Then 10 days later I had pain in my left eye and for the next two days my eye was sore.    I need help in knowing if I should take the next shot or can I wait for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and take it.

One week later (2/5), woke around 2am with same feeling, but at time of report (10:0am, 2/5), she has taken Allegra and using throat lozenge and feels throat symptoms are improving. She reports that she does battle environmental/seasonal allergies, has been experiencing post nasal drip and some intermittent itchy eyes and scalp this week so this could be related to allergies. She also c/o red &#34;rash&#34; at injection site about the size of 50 cent piece which she first noted today - denies pain or swelling.  Writer advised she continue daily allergy medicine, consider using Benadryl as directed on the day of 2nd vaccination, and at any time between now and following administration of 2nd vaccine, if she should have worsening symptoms to seek care immediately. Also recommended 30 minutes observation period following 2nd vaccine - due 28 days from 1/29/21. She verbalized agreement with all.

In  a couple of minutes I felt very light headed.   While scheduling my second dose, I started feeling  strong pressure inside my head.  I didn&#39;t not feel any pain, just a lot of pressure.     When measuring my  blood pressure (usually, in my case,  it is 120 X 80)  I was told my high number was at 178 x 80.   After resting for some 20 minutes, I was fine again and drove home.    I felt a bit strange  for a couple of hours.

After 10 minutes she reported that the symptoms were getting worse, upon visual inspection, it did not appear that her tongue, lips, mouth or throat were swelling. The patient refused an epi-pen and to call 911 as she felt there was no problem with breathing. She was given 50 mg of diphenhydramine intramuscular injection after refusing an epi-pen. After 10 minutes she said the tingling and warming sensation began to subside. She sat under observation for a total of an hour and 40 minutes after receiving the vaccine before leaving the site. Patient was highly encouraged to not be alone the rest of the day and to report to the ER if any further signs or symptoms developed.

When I saw it it was a rash approx 4 inches in diameter. Took Benadryl and put calamine on it. At 2:30 am I woke up with a full body rash head to toes. Raised white bumps. Again took Benadryl  every 5 hours and they went away in 24 hour. On Feb 10  out of the blue started sneezing 10 times in a row and suddenly had a full on cold symptom Watery rt eye, rt sided headache runny nose. I am a vaccinator for the Health Dept and have worked 3 clinics. I worked 2 clinics with only having 1 vaccine on board. Today Feb 11th I am going to get a covid test.  I am scheduled to vaccinate people tomorrow but I will cancel because I don&#39;t know if I have covid or just a cold. I contacted my health provider but have not heard back from him.

The facility had me stay for about 40 minutes. Nothing got worse. Last night I discovered 2 ulcers in my mouth and was very tired. This morning I have diarrhea and its a yellow color. Ulcers are still in my mouth and occasionally I taste a medal taste.

By 9 PM I also had a severe headache with eye pain and dizziness and started to have chills and fever. The chills and fever lasted during the night even with the use of tylenol and ibuprofen. The highest the fever was 100.6. On 02-11 continued with ear problems, headache and eye pain and dizziness. Also at about 10 AM I thought I had an episode of hallucinating when I saw a man walk into our house. When I asked who he was he disappeared. I have had no more episodes like this. This morning I continue with headache and eye pain, dizziness and ear problems. My left arm  at the site is pink about quarter size and itches.  The symptoms are less painful than 02-11-21.

Heart rate jumped to 150 and stayed above 125 for several minutes. I could barely walk back to  vaccination area where pharmacist waited with epipen.  I was given water and after a few minutes HR went below 100.  I stayed another 30 minutes and left however I did still feel a bit dizzy.  At about 8 hours post injection got chills and fever of 101.5 and HR remained high (above 102) for at least 6 hours after onset of fever.   Resting HR usually 59 and still remains above 90 at 48 hours.

                                                On Wednesday, February 3, I received my first COVID vaccination shot, as a medical volunteer at a clinic.   After about three or four days, I had sensation on my left hip that felt like my skin was tingling/burning. Last Thursday, February 11, I began noticing rash like bumps in my pubic area. I thought at first that it was a chaffed place from running. But the bumps continued to spread, including at the base of my spine and my left buttock. And all of the rash is only on my left side. (Oddly, the same side that I received the COVID vaccine shot.) The bumps look like those of poison ivy. But it hurt rather than itched.   Last Saturday and Sunday, (February 13 and 14), it was at its worst, and hurt even to sit down.  Monday, Feb. 15 and Tuesday Feb 16, the rash was still prevalent, but swelling was down  but still feels uncomfortable. I am hoping that it is getting better. It appears to have very similar symptoms to shingles, but I have had both the old shingles vaccine, and both doses of the newer one. My second dose of the new shingles shot was on March 9 of last year, right before the lockdown.

Also, I am unable to chew anything without a reaction of cracking, extreme pain and it causes me to scream out loud.  It also happens it I yawn.&#34;

                                                Within a few minutes of the vaccine she could taste and smell a very strong medicine taste.  She did not notice until after another 10 minutes that her face was on fire.  She looked in the mirror and her face was red, much more on the left than the right.  It would decrease in intensity and then flare up again.  She then went to the doctor, tried to wait out getting into the doctor, but then decided to go to the ER.  Her blood pressure was 187/181, yesterday was 112/64.  They gave her a stronger Benadryl and Pepcid, monitored her and did her oxygen level which was 97%.  All other VS were normal.  Today, 2/18/21 the redness was gone by 10:00 the night of the vaccine.  Over the last 24 hours she has had a mucousy cough, and clearing of the throat, but otherwise feels back to normal.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the shot, my upper lip started tingling. Then both upper and lower lips were tingling. I could drink ok, so no problem swallowing. They took my blood pressure at the time and it was 104/55. I have low blood pressure but that was lower than normal. I stayed for 30 minutes and the tingling would come and go. They did offer to call an ambulance but I declined. I got up this morning and have 2 welts on my forehead and the left side of my lips are still tingling, and occasionally the right side. I will call my doctor tomorrow morning.

Mid-day, the right side of my tongue became numb.  But not so numb that I could not eat or drink. By evening I started feeling prickly sensation as one does when novacaine is wearing off. Slept throughout the night. Woke on Saturday, February 27, 2021 with less numbness and prickly sensations. Sunday, February 28, 2021, slight numbness near eye, nose and mouth.  I had Bells Palsy in June 2000.

                                                I experienced onset of a severe headache and vomiting (x2, small amounts) the day after (2/2/2021)receiving the vaccine at noon-3pm. That evening as the headache resolved,  i noticed that the corners of my mouth and the area below my lips were sore and hard to the touch. These are all areas where i had fillers injected in the past (August 11, 2020). Restylane was the filler, i think. The symptoms i experienced felt exactly like when i received the injections in August 2020. The symptoms were gone by the next evening. I called my dermatologist  when i saw on the CDC Moderna training site (i&#39;m a Public Health Nurse volunteer vaccinator) that this &#34;rare&#34; side effect should be reported. She refused to file a VAERS report and told me that my symptoms were because i had vomiting and the muscles around my mouth were irritated, and that it was not from inflammation or a side effect of the vaccine.

Called 911 on way home. EMTs said allergic reaction. Oxygen sat was 97 percent. They said to go to ER if symptoms continued. Went to ER, where I received injections of Benadryl and steroids. Released after a period of observation. Today I am still flushed and tired from vaccine but am otherwise okay.

                                                RN was staffing a Covid clinic at HS. One of our other nurses gave her the 1st Moderna vaccine at 1:45 PM on 2/12/21. At 1:55 PM, the nurse who had given her shot noticed that patient was pale, and said she was not feeling well. Her BP was 179/110, and she said she usually has low BP. She c/o of &#34;feeling hot and was having difficulty breathing.&#34; She was seen by our medical director. After 30 minutes, her BP was 120/82. She said she ?felt a little better and called her sister to pick her up.? Later that evening, patient texted me saying I didn?t feel well when I got home, had trouble focusing literally and had a crying jag and felt shaky on the inside. I kept hydrating, took 25 of Benadryl and slept for 2 hrs., now feel close to normal. It was definitely a reaction to the shot-just weird!? Patient texted me on 2/13/21 that ?the FDA thinks one vaccine may be enough for 80?90% effectiveness, so I might not get the 2nd dose? On 2/15/21 patient texted, ?My PCP thinks what I had was a side effect &amp; recommends taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Tylenol before the 2nd injection, and doesn?t seem to be worried about it!?   On 2/19/21, I received a text from patient at 5:28 AM as she was scheduled to staff a Covid clinic that day, beginning at 7:30 AM. She said, ?I have been up for a couple hrs w/severe eye pain and can?t hardly open my eye but it hurts to close it too! At 10:37 AM she texted, ?I just got home from eye doctor and was prescribed drops 4X/day. Apparently, there are pin holes in my sclera &amp; cornea which hurt so bad I had lavender cold pack on all day &amp; couldn?t stand the light. It is a corneal abrasion &amp; I have no idea why that would happen suddenly?. The following day, she texted me a picture of her L arm injection site which she said was ?very itchy and hot! Not painful-? It was about 6 inches in diameter, red, inflamed,  delayed cutaneous rx.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:30AM. Around 4:00PM that day I started having severe dizziness. About 40 minutes later I had severe pain in my neck, back, and shoulders. I have had 3 herniated discs in the past and the pain from this was much worse than that pain.  About the same time I felt a headache coming on that just got worse as the night went on. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep, however, the pain was so great that I could not lay down flat or sit up. I spent the night walking the floor. During the night I vomited several times. I also developed jaw pain, earaches, and a sore throat.  But the worse part was that during the night I started to feel the sensation of pins and needles being thrust into my legs, ankles, arms, and hands. I never did however have a fever. I finally was able to fall asleep at about 5AM and slept for several hours. When I woke up the pain was mostly gone and I was just left with no energy at all so that I could hardly lift my head off the pillow. I stayed in bed the entire day and the next day I was fine.

                                                Approximately 12 minutes after the injection my lips began to tingle and feel like they were swelling. My mouth, jaw, and teeth began to tingle and became numb. I was in the 30-minute wait period. After 30 minutes I reported the side effect to personnel at the checkout station who said that was not a side effect he had on the list.  I took a Claritin 10 mg tab approximately 1 hour later with no resolve of numbness. I took a 10 ml dose of Benadryl at approximately 9 pm and again at 1 am.  I continue to have a slight tingling sensation on my face as of now.

                                                Began feeling feverish, achy with chills and blurry vision. Gradually worsening with light sensitivity (wore sunglasses indoors to reduce eye pain.) Temperature 99.5 at 15:00 and 100.2 at 20:15. Took two Ibuprofen and slept through to following morning. Awoke mostly symptom-free around 10 am. Continue to feel unusually cold. Treating this by wearing a warm sweater indoors. N.B. Light sensitivity may possibly be attributed to being under florescent lights (see Allergies and Reactions above) for more than an hour while waiting for shot and waiting to check for possible reaction to the shot.

                                                Tired within an hour of shot.  Woke on Sunday 3/9/21 with a blinding headache across forehead and down to bridge of nose.  Extreme light sensitivity to eyes.  Opening refrigerator or turning on a light was like having a spot light  in my eyes.  could not open eyes due to eye pain/strain.  drapes and blinds could not be opened.  Woke on Monday with no improvement and still tired.   Put on an eye mask on Sunday, and couldn&#39;t remove it until Tuesday morning.  Still have a slight headache and some light sensitivity but both seem far less intense today, Tuesday, 3/11/21.  Hopeful tomorrow will return to normal.

I took Acetaminophen every 8 hours through to 8:00 AM March 10.  I was too weak to prepare meals and I live alone so I ate only 8 or 10 cookies throughout the day as they were easy to grab and get back to bed.  Had moderate sweating episodes throughout the day and through the night of March 9/10.    Still felt sore when I woke up at 8:00 AM on March 10, 2021.  Took about 2 hours for me to get myself comfortable being upright and able to dress and move about.  Waited for Acetaminophen to work.

                                                March 3 - switched from daily 10mg Loratadine to Zyrtect. Continued till current. March 5, about 10AM   Vaccine Shot: Went over allergy/Zyrtec info with pharmacist, she had no concern. Within about half an hour, sinuses filled up, got a bit of a sore shoulder, faint headache, a bit fatigued.  Got through the day fine ?  monthly paperwork, chopped salad veggies, outside to take a short walk twice.  Noon -- ears got itchy, tinnitus increased.   3PM ? sinus pressure has increased.  4:15PM - hands cold and clammy.  6PM ? below waist joints all getting a bit achy and have lots of after-dinner gas. 8PM -- Bedtime will sleep propped up at 45 degree angle, just in case wheeziness begins. March 6 ?4:15AM  up to bathroom at and headache is gone, joints not aching. The Day -- Tired and resting as needed. Did some laundry, dishes, hand sewing on a couple of projects.   Did a couple of short walks again. 8PM -- Bedtime will sleep propped up at 45 degree angle, again just in case wheeziness begins. March 7 ?7:15AM woke feeling much more tired. Made some tea and have some light nausea, so holding off on toast.  Put yesterday?s folded laundry away and found myself a bit light-headed and getting short of breath. Tried some yoga breathing, seemed to help. 7:40AM (about 46 hrs. after shot) ? Short of breath, sweaty and cold clammy hands. Hard gut cramps and 2 trips to toilet that emptied my colon. 8:15AM airways/neck feel tight.  For SOB, tightness, a bit of wheeze -- drinking cold cool water, cool cranberry tea, yoga breathing, meditation to calm, related Reiki energy work. By 8:45AM all symptoms done. Resting with tea, water. 9:25AM ? another round gut cramps and trip to toilet.  By 10AM OK.

It was difficult to do anything when arriving home, went to bed. I was better the next morning (today) but my brain is still fogged.

                                                Immediately upon receiving the shot I felt pain behind my left ear.  It continued throughout the next day whereupon I also started experiencing numbness on the left side of my face similar to getting a shot of Novocaine at the dentist.  As each day passed, the symptoms kept progressing across my face until my mouth is permanently skewed to the right.  It makes eating, drinking and speaking difficult.  Coincidentally the day after my vaccination, I had an appointment on Friday, March 12 at 10:30am for my first appointment with my new doctor.  I mentioned the ear pain (the numbness didn&#39;t start until that same afternoon) and she mentioned it wasn&#39;t uncommon for the lymph glands to be affected by the vaccination.  I assumed my symptoms would go away in a few days.  When they kept getting more pronounced, I sent her a couple of emails but she was out of the office until Tuesday, March 16.  Her assistant contacted me on Tuesday the 16th and told me to call 911 and go to the emergency room.  I drove myself to the Medical Group emergency room and was seen by the Dr.  After examining me, she also consulted with a neurologist and they diagnosed me with bell&#39;s palsy and said it would take between six to eight months to self correct.  She prescribed me Predisone 20mg dosage of three tablets once a day and Valacyclovir 1 gram dosage three times a day.  She also suggested I get some eye ointment to use at night and eye drops to be used four times a day since my left eye doesn&#39;t close all the way now.

                                                Following the vaccine went to the grocery store and had her mask on, when she got home she was itching around the mask area/mouth area.  It then kept itching, and that night she went to rub it and it was full of blisters that popped and oozed and continued like that.  Now her skin feels like elephant skin, burning and itching, and feels like she has somebody burning her with a cigarette and stabbing her with a needle at the same time, and this is everywhere and extremely painful that continues to keep spreading.  She has it from the top of her head, in her head, in her ears, and down to her feet to the arch of her foot.   She went to the UC the morning of 3/11/21, and she told her that she needed to go to the ER, which she did.  They sent her home with Benadryl cream, Benadryl tablets and put on Prednisone, a Z-Pak and nothing has helped.   She went back to the ER on 3/12/21, and was put on  Hydroxyzine.  Her eye is so swollen right now that she can only see a small slit through it and the left eye is swollen shut  and cannot take the pain and is going to go back to the ER one more time.

                                                I felt funny within an hour of the vaccination. By 1 p.m my lower lip felt tight, when I looked in the mirror around 3 p.m. I noticed my lower lip was  swollen.  My husband says it was swollen and purple. By bedtime, the swelling in the lip had gone down. About 3 am, I was awoken by shivers going through my whole body. My feet and hands were like ice cubes. I curled up and stuck my head under the covers, but keep shaking. Got up about 5 am, and stood by the fireplace. Heavy shaking stopped by 7am. I continued with lighter shivers through the morning. Temperature taken at noon showed low grade fever of 99.4 ..  Took Tylenol and felt better. Not much of an appetite had toast and chicken noodle soup to eat, lots of water. Following day I felt back to normal.

                                                Post vaccine 2/9/21, I experienced drop in O2 Sat over a period of several weeks as I log my daily vitals (blood sugar, BP, Temp, Pulse rate and O2 Sat in percent).  I have O2 concentrator that I use as needed via nasal cannula.  I do have SOB with exertion due to Sarcoidosis of the Lung.  I notified my PCP on 2/19 of a morning sat of 89 which came up with O2 and breathing exercises, I also took a 20mg. Lasix and Mucinex chewable which usually helps with congestion.  With O2 and rest, my O2 Sat improved and extra O2 was stopped.  Then again my O2 steadily dropped over a period of a week, I coughed more (always have come cough), SOB. On March 7th, getting ready for bed, I became severely SOB, O2 Sat now 82, I called 911.  Was alert, oriented when Paramedics arrived, but needed 100% O2 and transported to Hospital, SOB was severe, gasping/drowning, loss of awareness, apparently resp. arrested, was intubated.  STAT CT with Contrast, and Echocardiogram, R/O PE, Lung collapse, etc.  (No PE/or collapse). MY supposition is that I had a slow moving allergic response to Moderna Vaccine (I am a former healthcare worker of 20 years) and currently work in healthcare medical devices in Ultrasound.  I closely watch vaccine development and read research articles on Sarcoidosis, vaccines and COVID. I participated and continue with a Sarcoidosis Study). I think I experienced cytokine storm with my ultrasensitive immune system. I use oral steroid (QVAR 40mics inhaled daily) which I doubled after taking the vaccine for a few weeks. I have had a MMR vaccine last June 2020 and Quadvalent Flu vaccine last August 2020.

                                                A broken blood vessel on my left eye.; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 67-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed a broken blood vessel on her left eye.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included valproate semisodium, amlodipine, clopidogrel bisulfate, bupropion hydrochloride, iron polysaccharide complex, multivitamins, potassium, acetylsalicylic acid, sodium bicarbonate and humira.   On 26-MAR-2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 046A21A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 26-MAR- 2021, she noticed a broken blood vessel on her left eye which doesn&#39;t really bother her.   Treatment information was not provided.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

After sitting down I experienced visual disturbance in my right eye of blurred vision and corona of bright lines that zigzagged. These symptoms slowly resolved over the next hour, but left with extreme fatigue.

Patient was emitting a choking, sputtering noise. Her hands were clenched so hard that pharmacist had difficulty separating them. Her head was extended backward and clenched. Patient&#39;s eyes were unfocused and rolled back. Pharmacist observed patient for about 15-30 seconds before administering epinephrine 0.3mg IM. Patient became responsive and was allowed to drink enough water to wet her mouth. Patient then vomited. EMS showed up within 5 minutes of incident and declared patient appeared normal other than an elevated heart rate. Patient declined further care from EMS. Pharmacist called patient after an hour to verify she was still fine, which she was.

                                                Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss in left ear. Symptoms began Friday evening Jan. 8, 2021. Sounded like muffled sound in my ear, water running, ringing. Then on Saturday Jan.9, 2021 my left ear felt like it had to pop and I felt my hearing was impaired.  By Sunday evening Jan. 10, 2021, I could barely hear out of my left ear. I called MD immediately Monday morning, Jan. 11, 2021 and was seen that afternoon. I was examined and had a hearing test. I was diagnosed with SSHL and started treatment of a series of steroid injections directly into my eardrum to save my hearing immediately. I have had 2 injections and hearing test since then. The doctors feel this was a side effect of the COVID vaccine due to my compromised immune system, but not an allergic reaction, but a side effect. I had the same condition about 15 years ago from a virus.

Flu-like symptoms began at about 30 hours post injection and continued for at least 10 hours at which point I slept.  All gone like magic the next morning, except for the redness and tenderness at the injection site, which continues as of this report, but is much less.  No treatment except rest and fluids.  I submit this report to help with your statistical analysis.

                                                Developed  extreme facial redness which was very warm to touch. Also lips were tingly and somewhat numb feeling. I felt very anxious which is not typical for me, I have had several other vaccines with no reaction in past. I had left the facility following 15 minutes of monitoring and took off my mask in the car. I looked in mirror because my face felt so warm. My husband was with me and symptoms did not worsen so we went home which only took 10 minutes and after another 30 minutes it did not subside so I took a low dose of liquid Benadryl. This eventually relieved my symptoms. I took another low dose at bedtime also. I slept through the night and had no further problem the next day. Thus  I did not contact a physician or the facility.

My huband checked my temperature and it was almost 101; so he gave me some tylenol. It did not help. Between 1 and 2 pm I became nauseous and started vomiting. My husband called the Dr&#39;s office but could not reach anyone nor was he able leave a message to report that I was sick and my temp was now 102.  I suffered through the night with tylenol and sips of water, gingerale and tea. On Saturday morning still having rather mild chills and low grade temp of 99.7 and feeling really tired but by evening I could eat soup and crackers which stayed down and drinking sprite,  ale and tea. Sunday,  still feeling tired but moving more and keeping fluids down. I noticed that I was hungry but food had no taste. Fever broke early Monday morning, still feeling sluggish but much improvement.

                                                I felt foggy and disoriented and tired within a half hour of receiving the vaccine.   I felt pain in my arm traveling to my underarm.  After an hour I felt like the inside of my skin was prickly and tingly, my face was flushed and burning.  I was so tired I had to lay down.  I just stared into space.  There was ringing in my ears.  My heart rate was a good 20 beats per minute faster than normal.  By bedtime, my face was slightly swollen and I was unable to read because the letters were jiggly.  I had a traveling headache from the side to the top of my head through my eyes.  My breathing was more rapid and shallow.  I felt intermittent chest tightness. And pain.  The next morning, I felt better, but the prickly skin continued and my chest and back were  sore.  I had intermittent cramping in my feet and was sore in my joints.  My arm was very tender.  I was still tired and my heart rate was still elevated.  I did not sleep well and got up frequently during the night to walk around.  By the third day the prickly skin was almost gone, but I have had cramping in my chest and feet.  I am very tired.  I still have an occasional traveling headache.

                                                My lips became numb around 2-3 hours after my shot on February 3rd.  I took 2 Benadryl before I went to bed.  The following morning  2/4 I experienced for a short time warmth and tingling down both of my arms but it then went away and my lips were still numb.  I again took 2 Benadryl that morning and again 2 Benadryl that night.  The following morning 2/5 my lips were still numb and again I took 2 Benadryl in the AM and also in the PM.  The next morning 2/6 I woke up have chills and shaking and my lips still numb.  At that time I called 911 and was taken to  Hospital and treated for an allergic reaction with at IV of Dexamethasone and Pepcid through an IV.  They watched me for around 2 hours and I was then discharged to go home with a script for Dexamethasone pills to take again on Monday morning.  As I write this my lips are still numb, but I have no other symptoms.

                                                About 10:00 pm on Saturday evening of noon injection, injection site was painful--at the same time got intensive, but very brief headache, very dry eyes and, within minutes, (no idea if it&#39;s related) I noticed weird sensation in my nether regions, which felt like my underwear was knotted and pressing on it.  Went to check and found big kind of oblong lump (abscess) on outer labia extending to inside thigh--quite painful.    It came out of nowhere--hadn&#39;t noticed it at all before that moment.  Goggled it and thought it was probably Bartholin&#39;s Abscess and treated it as such.  (Later realized it couldn&#39;t be because it wasn&#39;t inner, but outer labia.)  Took sitz bath, and continued taking sitz baths next day and applying heat.  Abscess extremely painful, fever 100.3--quite high for me., rash on chest and abdomen.  It started draining while sleeping Sunday night and continued draining slowly on Monday with fever down to 99 and now down to 98.1.  Rash has disappeared.  Arm no longer sore.  Abscess still painful but less so

By the time that she looked in her rear view mirror her face was swelling up.   Her face started to burn, fast heart beat, and dizziness.  Her neck started to burn as well.  She looked at the side effects.  She called her doctor and took 2 Benadryl as she recommended, and took a nap.  Her doctor told her to continue taking the Benadryl and to call us to report the reaction.  She still has the swelling and the burning sensation in her face, and is still getting a little dizzy but it comes and goes.  The fast heartbeat comes and goes as well.

I was very tired and achy all day with a bad headache. I had some nausea. I took Aleve but it didn&#39;t help much. I noticed when I went to bed that I had an open, bleeding sore on my right wrist. I knew that I had not done anything to hurt my wrist. Feb. 25. When I took a shower, I saw that I had an open, bleeding sore on my right shin. The right side of my tongue was hurting and sore. When I looked in the mirror at my tongue it had little red blotches all over the right side.  I have a bad headache but not as bad as yesterday.  I am also somewhat tired, but not achy.

Her blood pressure was retaken before she left and it remained in the 140s/100s. She said this is higher than her normal but it could be due to anxiety.

Remain isolated from others due to age- so it?s hard to believe it?s a cold bc of lack of exposure to others.

Nurse took BP reading of 148/93 (high). Gave me a bottled water to drink. Tongue began to feel tingly. Repeated BP at 10:30am 160/109. Arm was tense and could have been a false read.  Repeated BP at 10:35am 140/111.  I became chilled and shaky and asked for crackers since I hadn?t eaten that morning.  Was given  and ate 6 small peanut butter crackers and felt a little better. At 10:57am I left Meijer with a BP reading of 144/107. Went home, ate breakfast of scrambled eggs and toast.  Laid down and rested  most of the day. BP at 6pm 139/90.

                                                First two days after vaccine- tired. By day three began experiencing back pain. By Wednesday, January 20th severe back pain and chest tightening. I went first to Urgent Care. Dr. said EKG ok but I should follow up with Dr. or ER. That evening I went to ER at Hospital. By then it felt like my back and chest were in vice. It did not feel like regular back pain- more searing and deep spasms. Had a gnawing kind of feeling in my stomach and esophagus. Pain in upper part of my body....sometimes waves of pain in shoulders and down back half of my arms. ER Dr gave me shot of pain meds and sent me home after a few hours. Vice like feeling subsided but deep muscle pain in back continued.It was not as severe as the previous day. Over the next week it continued to go from severe back to mild.I visited my primary care Dr/PA and tried changing GERD meds from Famotidine to another- no help. Tried muscle relaxers- I just slept on those. About a week after first visit I went to ER again after a bad night of the vice like feeling in chest and back. ER Dr. did CAT scan of heart and lungs. No sign of pneumonia . Since then I have had an endoscope, seen a cardiologist, and an orthopedic Dr.  After second dose, reaction came back, but less severe than the first time.

I now have constant tinnitus and am having my hearing checked next week because I feel I have hearing loss.   The fatigue is debilitating.  I start to feel better and another wave hits me.  I was advised by my doctor to not take the second dose.  The tinnitus is getting louder.  It causes anxiety.  I don?t know how I am going to live with it.

                                                Shortly after receiving her  Covid vaccination, patient complained of a weird taste, dizziness and feeling faint. I monitored the patient closely, checked  her vital signs and everything was normal. Medical history revealed patient has type 2 DM and HTN. I asked patient if she had taken her meds and eaten breakfast (time was 11:15am at this point). She said she took her meds but hadn&#39;t eaten breakfast. I bought her orange juice and a few snacks. In less than 5 minutes after eating/snacking. She mentioned that she was feeling remarkably better. I monitored her for 15 minutes more to make sure she was fully recovered. She was very grateful and felt at ease leaving the pharmacy. I will check on her later.

The injection site swelled and the lymph nodes in both arms swelled and were painful.  Especially in my right arm pit where I had lymph nodes removed at the time of my breast cancer.  I applied ice packs to the swelling at the injection site and just bore through the rest.  My arm at injection site was sore for a couple of days as well as the right side lymph nodes.  The joint pain and mouth pain subsided on its own over night and was fine the next day.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid last March.  I received my first vaccine March 3 of this year.  I got a temperature of 103 degrees,  I was nourish , my muscles, Joints and bones hurt so much I couldn&#39;t lift myself out of bed without extreme pain.  The chills I got made me literally shake.  My arm where I was given the shot, I couldn&#39;t lift it.  Even the other arm hurt bad.  My mouth hurt, my teeth hurt, my gums bleed for four days after and the teeth hurt too for that length of time.  My stomach was itchy but no rash.  I felt like I had the virus again minus other issues I had when I did have it.   I&#39;m scheduled to receive my second dose March 31 and I&#39;m very very nervous about it.  I don&#39;t think people who had the virus, especially those who had it very bad like myself, should get vaccinated.     It took 2 weeks to recover from all the pain.   HELP!

                                                Sore arm the next day and that lasted three days. On the 11th of the month, I had a sore neck and shoulders - upper part of my back ached. I had a temperature of 99.5. COVID test - Test on 13th of January. Bad diarrhea started  - no vomiting. Felt like a MACK truck had run over me. I didn&#39;t run any temperature from 12th and after.  It didn&#39;t go to lungs at all. On the 16th, I received the BAM infusion . Also was put on steroids and an antibiotic - started those on the 12th before the infusion. Breathing treatments with a nebulizer started those one 11th also.  - Was done at Hospital. I did lose my smell and taste - that happened on January 14th. That infusion helped - by Sunday, I was feeling a lot better and by 18th it kept getting better after that and I have gotten my smell and taste back. It took about two weeks to get those senses back (28th of the month).

                                                Within a minute of receiving the vaccination, my throat and tongue began to swell.  After about 10-15 minutes, my face and head began itching and my Eustacian tubes began to close (as if flying in an airplane and unable to &#34;pop&#34; my ears).  I took a 25 mg benadryl right after receiving the vaccination and remained at the pharmacy for an hour observation.  When I arrived home, about 1 hour and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, I took another benadryl and slept for about 6 hours.  Upon waking, all symptoms were gone.  The reaction to the second vaccination was more intense than the reaction to the first Covid-19 vaccination.

Abated some but heaviness remains around left eye (especially between brow area and eye) and left side of head.  Also feels warm in that area.  I am worried some but just keeping an eye on it at home.  Called my doctor?s office and nurse said go to pharmacy tomorrow and report it to them.  I am concerned about getting the follow up shot.

                                                Approximately 3 1/2 hrs after receiving my 1st shot, my face turned beet red, was very hot to the touch, burned like a sunburn and both my eyes were very itchy.  This lasted approximately 48 hrs. The 24-he nurse line at my insurance company suggested I see someone at an urgent care facility. On Sunday, I started taking Benadryl, which seemed to help my symptoms.

                                                Got the vaccine, and about 24 hours later she started to feel an ache in her front left tooth.  She was wondering if this was due to the vaccine or not.  She was unable to lift her arm as well.  In a couple of hours it was real sore and she kept hitting it with her tooth.  Her upper gum was then tender and could not touch it.  She then could not chew on the front left tooth, and even hurt with touching of her tongue.  As the night progressed more teeth were tender, and the lip was also more tender.  She started to get a headache and then all of her joints were starting to hurt.  The next morning, Friday morning she had no energy at all, just felt terrible.  Her face was now swollen, as well as her upper lip.  That night it was getting worse adn worse and her gums were so itchy and all the teeth on the left side felt loose.  It then reached her jaw and then the swelling went to her eye.  She called her PCP, and put on antibiotics, to take a antihystamine and a steroid.  Told her to go to the ER if it did not gete better.  It was horrible by Monday morning, she went to UC and had an abscess in her tooth.  They put her on penicillin, told her not to take the other antibiotics.  By Tuesday morning the swelling had gone down, and the swelling in the gums were also gone, and the teeth were also better.  The abscess was also feeling better.  She had no issues with her gums and teeth prior to this.  By the time she finished the penicillin she was fine.  She went to the dentist and they could not find anything wrong with her, and informed her that it was proof that the vaccine was doing it&#39;s job.

                                                Arm was sore where shot was given Saturday, 1:45PM March 6. Noticed slight muscle aches that afternoon. By 8PM those effects continued. I went to bed early and awoke in the night with extreme thirst and severe chills. I put on layers and heat was blasting near my head from below headboard.  I had a fever of 104 degrees which went down soon after I removed layers. I recall being very hard to get out of bed when the chills were at their worst so I was in a fetal position to try to stay warm. Sunday, thirst, chills and fever were gone, but I had an intermittent headache, sore arm where shot was given and my other arm!, also muscle aches and tiredness. By Monday, I had muscle aches,  tiredness and light-headedness; Tuesday I had slight nausea and headache a short while, but mainly tiredness. Wednesday, I still had soreness where shot was given, tiredness and light-headedness, but otherwise was feeling better.  I canceled plans Thursday involving heavy physical labor (native plant restoration)  just to rest a bit more. Basically, I had a bouquet of symptoms over several days - grateful not to have had all at once and can only imagine how bad coronavirus must be.

                                                At around 9 pm I felt a funny feeling in my lips that made me feel like I might have trouble talking.  It didn&#39;t last long, but my daughter suggested I take my blood pressure.  It registered 177/90 something.  Thought that was unusually high considering we had just been sitting talking for hours after my shot, no exertion at all.  I felt good. We waited 15-20 minutes to check in again.  No nervousness or anything.  It had climbed into the 190/100 range.  My daughter suggested we go to the ER.  I didn&#39;t think it necessary.  After maybe 20 minutes we took it again and it was just over 200/low 100 something.  My daughter said sorry Mom but this is getting very high we are going to ER.  We got there near 11:30 pm I believe.  When we arrived my blood pressure registered 220/116.  Doctors thought I hadn&#39;t taken my blood pressure medication. (wrong, I always take it)  Doctors thought I was nervous about the shot.  (wrong, it had been a very calm afternoon and evening with my adult daughter who is a health care provider.  Tests came back fine.  They had me stay for a little bit but then sent me home with instructions to see my Cardiologist the following week because they felt maybe my blood pressure meds were no longer adequate.  I don&#39;t think they believed that extremely hight BP was from the vaccination, but I absolutely do.  I saw my Cardiologist on Monday. He felt all was fine.  Adjusted the dosage on one blood pressure med but did believe the high BP could have been from vaccination.  On Sunday May 14 I took it easy.  My BP came down slowly by increments of 10 for the systolic throughout the day.  By Monday I was at 140/90 at home.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

She denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, diaphoresis, headache, cough, rash, or syncope. She does have a history of seafood allergies and had similar reactions after eating seafood. She tells me 3 years ago after a flu shot she fainted.  She tells me the past 2 years after her flu shot she had nausea or vomiting. She tells me she fell yesterday and hurt her hip but she did not hit her head.  No LOC. She tells me she takes baby aspirin nightly. Family history: Mom and dad both died at age 82 from lung cancer.

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA   Wednesday I had the vaccine.  Later I had thought I had bit my tongue but could not remember doing that.  Thursday - I still had the feeling of bitten my tongue.  Looking at my tongue to see the damage, no cut tissue but, there was ~ 3 bumps on the Left side of my tongue on the &#34;side&#34; of my tongue. Friday there were about 6.  Saturday they started to disappear there were 2.  By Sunday they were gone.  Do not know if this was from the vaccine but it was a strange thing to happen and the timing made me think there may be a connection.    I HAD MY SHOT IN MY LEFT ARM.   IT WAS MY 1ST SHOT.

Tried Advil, then tylenol - didn&#39;t tough headache.  7:00AM - Headache, Body Aches, Fatigue, chills, mild diarrhea and dehydration throughout the day.  Slept, finally that night.  Advil helped the head and body aches finally.   2/21/21 - Left with body fatigue, mild diarrhea, dehydration.  Night sweats for most of that night. 2/22/21 - energy back, mild diarrhea left. 2/23/21 - good, except left with mild diarrhea  Leary of taking anything for the diarrhea, as I tend to block up.  Through this whole ordeal, I consumed tons of water, almost drinking nonstop due to the thirst.

                                                36 hours later, (approximately), I woke up with a rash. Under the both arms it looked like a sunburn. Across the chest an sides, it was spotty. The right side had more rash than the right, and both sides wrapped around to the back, about 2 inches, on both sides. Less going down the rest of the torso. Took Benadryl, 2-25 mg, 4 hours apart, for a total of 100 mg. 1:00PM, Feb. 26, rash faded significantly.  Also had a dry mouth and a bit of a racing heart, right after being given the vaccination &amp; again when the rashes appeared. However, this could have been anxiety. Both times it went away after walking &amp; deep breathing. Lasted for about 15 minutes each time.

                                                Began not feeling well about 8 hours after my shot. That night I developed a fever (under 100 degrees) and chills. Had some heart palpitations. Next day I still had a slight fever, general malaise, soreness from shot in arm, a few occurances of heart palpitations, sore back. On third day, no fever, but still felt under the weather, with a sore arm plus some hardness in the injection area. Had some palpitations that evening. By the 4th day, felt better in general, but began feeling a very slight numbness on lips and surrounding facial area. Arm still sore with hardness. Better on 5th day. Day 8 &amp; 9 had pains in lower shins. Day 9 I noticed tiny small bumps on upper front and back shoulders and upper arms. They were not hive like and some were itchy. Took some Benadryl that night which didn&#39;t reallly help. Days 10-12 - still have tiny bumps some slightly pink, mostly skin tone, spreading to neck area. Saw my internist on 2/25/21 Day 14 to ask if symptoms related to vaccine shot. He didn&#39;t think the rash was related because it didn&#39;t start away after shot. The continuing ever so slight numbness in lips and surrounding area may be just from anxiety, he said. 3/1/21 - still have occasional slight numbness off and on of lips with &#34;grainy&#34; rash still present.

The doctor thought is that it may be a herpes simplex 1virus that  has activated itself because my immune system was compromised by the covid shot. not usre about body rash. today mar 1 my rash is a LOT worse on torso and very itchy. i am taking valacyclovir 3 times a day and rinsing mouth with lidocaine hydrochloride viscous solution. we are still awaiting lab results.

                                                About one hour post inoculation my speech became jibberish. Cognitively, I could organize my thoughts and knew exactly what I wanted to express to my husband and our waitress, but when I opened my mouth to speak, only jibberish came out.  I couldn&#39;t say anything meaningful.  It lasted about 2&#43; hours and hasn&#39;t reoccured.   That night when I went to bed I was extrememly light sensitive.  We had the usual degree of light in our bedroom but with my eyes closed it felt like all the overhead lights in the room were on.  I had to block out the alarm clock, but that was the only adjustment that could be made.  Drapes were closed and no other lights of any kind were on.  That was bothersome for the first couple of nights. I&#39;m still having a difficult time falling asleep when I go to bed and staying asleep all night.  My &#34;fight or flight&#34; response is highly charged.

It started first on the tip of my tongue and got worse as the week progressed.  Everything felt like it was on fire.  I called my Dr, who called in a prescription mouthwash to swish in mouth and spit out.  When I realized it might be related to the vaccine, I also took a Benedryl which seemed to help.  I?m on day two of the meds.  It?s not burning quite as badly, but still isn?t gone.

                                                Approximately an hour after I received the shot, I felt pins and needles on my lips and a metallic type taste in my mouth. My arm was sore , as expected, and I felt some body aches, and tiredness. It wasn&#39;t until Tuesday that my mouth was feeling numb and the bad taste in my mouth returned. I did not have an appetite to eat. It didn&#39;t seem to bother me as much during the day as nighttime. I would wake up in the middle of the night with a terrible taste in my mouth and nausea. It seemed to be most uncomfortable by Thursday evening and I drank a lot of water all day Friday. I did not eat much on Friday because of the nausea and taste in my mouth. After I did eat something early Friday evening, I became very tired. Today I am better. I do not feel like my mouth is numb, and the bad taste is not completely gone, but I feel better. I will drink a lot of water today.

                                                Extreme fatigue, dizziness that resulted in 2 falls and complete loss of hearing. Dizziness started about 10 AM on Saturday morning (2/27) following the vaccination and continued until around 2 AM on Wednesday morning (March 3). Loss of hearing was gradual and started Sunday (2/28), but did result in complete loss of hearing which is slowly returning. She called in to the clinic to have adverse effects addressed.

                                                I reported the reaction I had to the vaccine on Feb 20, 2021.  By the time I got home I had developed an itching sensation all over my body. There was no rash, just outrageous itching.  Nothing worked to calm it. Tried Benedryl, Domeboro, Witch Hazel, Aloe Vera gel, Epsom salt soaks, and various creams to stop itching.  Nothing helped. Noticed it worsened if I was laying on my back. The itch is still prevalent and only periodically lessens when I sleep.  I developed severe Tinnitus that is non-stop and a loud low vibration hum that has been debilitating.  I use a sound generators to mask the high frequency sound, went to an audiologist, dentist, chiropractor, NUCCA chiropractor and  nutritionist

                                                Monday , March 8 I had itching at injection site but no rash. Tuesday , March 9 before bed I began to have vaginal itching that might have been a yeast infection. ( I haven?t had one fir 20&#43; years). Thereafter in the middle of the night I awoke to itching on the palms of my hands. When I woke up on Wednesday, March 10 I had a puffy lip on the left side of my mouth and swelling inside of mouth.  Through out the rest of the  day I got more and more tiny bumps on my legs, feet, arms and torso. I took Claritin (the only thing in the house)  before 9 am and the swelling disappeared from my mouth but  the lip was still a bit puffy.  I contacted my doctors office and a nurse recommended Benadryl and set me up with a virtual Dr appointment for 3/11 am. I was cautioned to go to the ET if swelling came back inside mouth. At 6pm I took Benadryl and will continue through the night. I purchased Monistat3 to use in case the yeast infection  was a separate issue. Will continue to take Benedryl through the night as needed.

                                                About 15 minutes after receiving the injection my nose started to itch a little.  It was so minor I was not concerned.  By 40 minutes after the injection when at home I was itching significantly all over my body.  My tongue was red, sore, and swollen.  My mouth and throat were red and sore.  I was having some trouble swallowing and hoarse.  I developed a cough.  I felt very tired and my hands, feet and face were swollen.  Maybe about 50 minutes after the injection, my chest was feeling tight like the start of asthma.  I used a Breo ellipta (100mcg fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 25 mcg inhalation powder.) Maybe 30 minutes later I was breathing better.  As the other symptoms worsened I took benedryl by mouth.I had an epipen, but I did not use it.  I awakened in the night and my joints (hands, knees, feet) were very sore and swollen.  I had a mild headache and lower back ache.  The other symptoms persisted except for the trouble breathing.  The  symptoms have, except the trouble breathing,  continued throughout the day after the vaccination but milder. However the fatigue and joint pain and swollen hands, feet, and face are still moderate.  I am considering taking another benedryl. I sent a non-urgent message today (the day after the vaccination) to my doctor describing what happened and what I did.  We had discussed precautions prior to the vaccinations because of my allergies.

                                                By the next morning I was very nauseous, fever, body aches, temperature, very thirsty, arm hurt, when I got up.  It got worse during the day.  Could not eat all day.  Slept a lot during the day on and off.  By evening felt a &#34;little&#34; better but still had all the side effects.  Slept well that evening and the following morning felt better.  As today has gone by, it is 4:30 PM and am feeling a lot better.  So total of 48 hrs. after injection I had the adverse events.

It has been two weeks since the shot, and the twitching seems to have stopped.  If this is a coincidence, it seems peculiar to me.

Some swelling and pain in lymph gland on left side near ear/throat. Appeared nine (9) days after vaccination. Woke up in morning with condition, not present the night before. Took claritan for two (2) days; thought it was an insect bite, but now believe it to be an adverse reaction to the vaccination. Have photographs of adverse reaction on arm.

                                                First vaccine on 1/16/2021, I experienced some numbing of my limbs (arms and legs). It was random and typically didn&#39;t last too long (except one time in my left arm that was quite dramatic and I took Bayer aspirin immediately) but was definitely not a normal experience in my body.  After the second vaccine on 2/15/2021, the next day, I had the expected fever (100.1 to 100.9) throughout the next 2-days, along with no appetite, energy, or strength. I expected it to dissipate but by day 3 &amp; 4, I felt even weaker and more exhausted. As the days turned into weeks (5&#43; weeks now), I&#39;ve experienced severe exhaustion needing to sleep most days 9-13 hours, consistent numbness in my arms (con&#39;t next page) and some w/legs, blurry vision, and very unbalanced. I went from walking several miles a day to barely being able to walk a few blocks due to unbalance, weakness and being out of breath. This has gone on for over 5-weeks now. It feels like I am a long-hauler but without having had Covid. I&#39;ve always been sensitive to drugs, expected to have a reaction, but never imagined something like this would go on for so long.   During this period, I had two Covid tests on March 1 and March 10. Both were negative. The week of March 8, I came down with a good old fashioned cold. PCP asked for the second Covid test and chest x-ray (all clear) on March 10. PCP did lab work on March 5. Everything showed as &#34;unremarkable&#34;.

Four days after the shot I had a shrimp dinner, and my tongue was swelling. I have never had any food allergies. I went to the ER where they gave me two doses of Epinephrine and I was admitted to the ICU with epinephrine drip. I was discharged the next day with a prescription of prednisone. I had been given 40mg of Solumedrol I tried not to take the prednisone as advised by the doctor. I started to get hives the following day. I was later prescribed multiple antihistamines and stayed on all of those since then. I am taking Zyrtec Twice daily Singulair once daily and Ranitidine since then and I have not had a reoccurrence of the hives. The doctor advised getting the Johnson &amp; Johnson instead of the second Moderna. I was unable to get a Johnson &amp; Johnson so now I am waiting again.

Tongue swelling does appear to have decreased. Could not see uvula but patient states she is not sure if you ever can she may have different anatomy. Vital taken for final time around 1100 and were BP 125/76 O2 96% and HR 74 which she says is normal for her. Made patient aware that after her husband drives her home that she should monitor symptoms and if they become worse she needs to call 911. Scheduled second dose of vaccine but told her to anticipate getting vaccine in Urgent care if okay with Director.

                                                Symptoms started on Saturday morning (1/16/2021)  following the shot having been administered the previous day (1/15/2021) at 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon.  Initially, I had a slight, constant  headache and &#34;medium&#34; fatigue.  I dismissed it as not important because it was relatively minor. and I am generally fatigued at the end of a work week.  The headache lasted all day but was fairly low level. I did not sleep well that night but was able to function during the next day (1/17/2021)  without a problem.  I don&#39;t remember if the headache was present that day.  However, on Sunday evening (1/17/2021) (around 6:00 p.m. or so) chills started to go up and down my body and my hands were very cold.  I had no fever.  I added more garments to keep warm and ignored or was distracted by my activities of the evening. Monday (1/18/2021) during the day the chills continued to go up and down my body  intermittently-- not really staying in one place -- but my hands remained very cold.  It should be stated that I prefer colder temperatures; i keep my house between 60-62 degrees in winter and I am able to stay comfortable with a shirt and sweater in that environment.  So, on Monday, the fact that I had chills was remarkable to me. The chills were intermittent. Tuesday (1/19/2021) I worked from home all day and had an electric heater going focused very closely on my body all day.  I was cold but don&#39;t remember having chills.  Tuesday evening the chills returned, along with a significant headache that circled my head (not focused in one spot), my body ached, my eyeballs ached; I had intestinal cramping .and I simply could not get warm due to the constant &#34;full-body&#34; chills. I went to bed with a heated mattress pad on,  flannel sheets, a comforter an d a thick wool  blanket. I could not get warm.  I was not able to sleep at all the entire night due mostly to the (major) physical discomfort and (minor) worry as to what was going on. I DID NOT have a fever. Around 8:30 on Wednesday morning, I was able to fall asleep as the chills had diminished and I was worn out. The body and eyeball aches were still present as was the intestinal cramping. Later that afternoon the symptoms started to diminish and I was able to sleep Wednesday night. I did not eat anything on Wednesday as I was not interested in food due to the discomfort of  the intestinal cramping. I was able to smell food and had not lost my sense of taste.  Thursday morning (1/21/2021,  I finally felt like I could eat and had  some food which tasted delicious to me.  I was able to get warm, had slight headache, cramping was mostly gone, ..I still had (reduced levels) body aches and eyeball aches.  I had no chills.  I was able to consume and tolerate reduced amounts of food.  Friday (1/22/2021) I was tired but able to function and felt as if I was returning to feeling like myself.  Today, Saturday(1/23/2021, I am feeling about 95% myself and relieved to have this behind me.  I am very concerned about how I might react to the second dose of the vaccine.  I am going to consult the local hospital and my PCP there to inquire about the advisability of getting the second dose.

                                                Noticed aching in left hip/leg.  Was out shopping and the pain progressively got worse by the time I got home was having trouble even walking.  The pain seemed to be in whole leg and seemed to be muscular and also a lot of pain in hip joint area.  Also was feeling a burning and numbness sensation down my leg.  By 7pm was in bed because it was too painful to walk.  Took 600 mg of Ibuprofen.  This morning the hip pain is better and I am walking ok. I still have burning and numbness mostly in the calf area of left leg. I am also feeling burning and numbness on the left area of my lip. This is an area of my lip where I have had cold sore in past but don&#39;t see a cold sore.

                                                30 minutes after injection, throat felt scratchy.   45 minutes after injection, roof of mouth felt swollen.  Then lips were numb.  Felt it was allergic reaction and took Claritin which helped a bit.  Then took Benedryl 25 mg. which seems to help further.  Took at 5PM and 9PM. Saw the doctor the next  morning  (2/5) and he prescribed methylPrednisolone to take PRN.  That evening, throat and roof of mouth felt a bit swollen so I took both Benedryl and prednisone.   2/6 Felt fine all day until about 9:30pm, felt hot and a bit  of nausea.  Again took Benedryl and prednisone.  2/7, this morning, feeling very tired but no allergy symptoms.  All vitals were normal this whole time.

I also had a metallic taste in my mouth that lasted for 3 days.  I took an antihistamine for 3 days.  On the 2nd day, the red area lightened and swelling, itching  decreased.  On the 3rd day he diameter of the affected area was now 3.5 inches with the center of outbreak  clearing but still red &#34;rash&#34;  around the perimeter (measuring about 0.5 inch.  By the end of the 3rd day, the rash was almost gone and completely gone on the 4th day.  I had this same metallic taste in my mouth almost immediately after the first vaccination on 1/30/21.  This lasted about 14&#43; hours. It was gone the next morning.

                                                High fever with chills, aches all over body, especially in places an injury occurred anytime in my life. Injection arm tender &amp; sore to touch from elbow to shoulder &amp; was slightly red around the injection site.  It felt like my body had been cut up into pieces &amp; scotch taped back together with all the pain everywhere. Thirsty , mildly nauseated.  Thursday morning I ate 5 bites of cream of wheat made with water. I was mostly bedridden until Thursday 18th night; I was able to eat broth &amp; noodle soup.  Continued in bed most of the time, began eating solid food Fri., mashed potatoes, crackers &amp; vegetable salad. Still very tired. By Fri. 2/19/2021 I was beginning to regain my strength to more normal levels. I still needed 2 hour naps &amp; slept 9-10 hours nightly. Still seemed I&#39;d get a low fever, then break it for several days.  I started sleeping on the sore arm side, cuz it was so painful on the other side &amp; on my back after several days in bed. My arm stopped hurting after 5 days3/1/2021 Today is my best day yet.  Happy to have the vaccine, no regrets!!! Thank you so much for that.

The very first symptoms, about 4 hours after the vaccine was heavy thirst, neck ache, and loss of appetite. Besides the above symptoms, starting about 12 hours after vaccine, was severe nausea. Only able to drink water and some apple juice. Could not get out of bed the day after vaccine without getting chills, breaking out in cold sweat and nausea. This is now the second day since vaccine and I have no severe symptoms. I am only feeling weak.

                                                About 5 minutes after the injection, my throat began to feel tight like it was swelling. When it did not improve in about 5 more minutes, I took a benedryl, which l carry with me in my purse. When the time was up that l was supposed to wait (15 min.), l pulled out of line but did not leave the parking lot. I parked behind the EMS  on duty to wait a while longer to be sure the symptom improved rather than getting worse. EMS talked with me to be sure l was ok, and to check for a rash, which l did not have. After about 10 more minutes my throat had improved to the point where l felt like l was going to be ok &amp; could drive home. I did experience tingling around my mouth, tooth pain, &amp; a metallic taste in my mouth . My drs. Office suggested l report these symptoms to you.

Didn&#39;t feel like eating or drinking anything, and my mouth got VERY dry. Had to force myself to sip water, but not enough. Dozed a lot throughout the day. Also had a sore arm, and the injection site turned black and blue, just like the first shot. But my arm was sore for about 4-5 days from the first shot, only2 days from this 2nd shot.

I am noticing that the top of inside my mouth (the palate) feels sore.  I am going to try some gly-oxide.  8:15am ? pain in my right leg is getting worse. Taking 3 Advil.  8:30am ? rinsed mouth with Peroxil and then with Gly-oxide.  My leg pain is back this evening but not as bad as it had been before.  3/14/21 ? During the night my mouth was very sore, so I got up to do a rinse with Gly-oxide.  Woke up with a headache.  Took 2 Advil.  My upper arm is sore and I have a redness with knotting.  My leg paid is almost all gone. I think I am going to be okay!

On March 8th woke up with swollen lower lip. Took Benadryl and was better by noon.  On March started breaking out with a rash on right side of body.  Took Benadryl and put Hydrocortisone on it.  Rash kept getting worse  with big spots and itching.  On  March 11th was worse so called the  Medical Center and asked if the Moderna vaccine could have caused this? They said, no! If got worse come in. March 11th at 9:oo P.M.  I could feel my upper lip swelling. Took Benadryl and thought it would be better by morning. It wasn&#39;t.  Woke up with red puffy eyes and a swollen upper lip. Looked like I had been in a fight. Time to get medical help.  Got into doctor at 9:30.  They said it wasn&#39;t from the shot but I know it was. On Pednisone and cream for shots. Finally getting better!

It went up my neck on the left side, into the gland and into my ear.  I used Flonase once a day for 5 days beginning on 3/6/21.  I was dizzy off and on for about a week, like my equilibrium was affected.  I had this same event occur with the 2015 and 2016 Flu Vaccine.  When my ear &#34;acts up&#34; my doctor has had me use the Flonase once a day for 5 days, even though Steroids can cause Cushing&#39;s symptoms.  My ear is still &#34;stuffy&#34; and the gland in my neck &#34;feels funny&#34;.  Hearing does not seem to be impaired.  I also developed &#34;Covid Arm&#34; on 3/14/20 and reported both events to my doctor that evening - 3/14/21

Feeling very unfocused, chills, sweats, ached all over, nauseous, felt lighted headed, very fatigued and went from sleep to awake every half hour. These symptoms continued for a week then slowly get better. One week from injection my arm became very sore and covered with rash at injection site.  Within the next 2 days I was covered with a rash.  I am still feeling very unfocused and fatigued as I write this on March 17, 2021. I chose not to have the 2nd dose as I am very concerned of having a worse reaction.  I did not ever have breathing difficulties or a fever.

For what it?s worth I thought I?d let you know.  I tried to let Vsafe know but did something incorrectly and my message didn?t go through.

                                                Ear infection.  Just on the right ear.  Thought it was unrelated, but now I am not so sure.  Went to outpatient clinic and was told it was ear wax.  NO!  I took drops in ear and it just got so much worse!  Went back a week later with excruciating pain!  Ear was draining and I could feel the heat and knew it was infection.  Got Cipro which helped with inflammation and also took prednisone for 6 days.  Dr  said the infection was behind the eardrum and that is why drops did not work.  I am usually a ball of energy.  tennis, hot yoga,  personal trainer at gym.  I am now weak as a kitten and my hearing is almost  gone in my right ear.

                                                The day after vaccination I had redness and swelling in my right eyelid. My eyelid was very red and almost swollen shut. I was told that the problems I was having had to do with the Vaccine by telehealth. After seven days because of the bruised look I consulted another doctor who told me that it was an infected Sty in my eye. I was prescribed an oral  antibiotic Doxycycline.  I have never had a Sty in my eye before and it is still a little red spot after two months.

Since seeing him on 3/8 I have received three injections in my left ear and two hearing tests, the last one being told I have profound hearing loss in my left ear and continue suffering with ringing in the left ear.  My next appointment is tomorrow 3/25. I pray that my hearing returns.

                                                1) Within 10 minutes of the injection, my upper lip and area between lip and nose became numb. I took some benedryl and the numbness went away within 5 hours.  My arm was sore for 5 days.  2) During the evening of March 12, seven  days post-injection, an annoyingly itchy 2x2&#34; red, bumpy rash appeared at the injection site. I used cortisone cream on it which relieved it but had to reapply it multiple times over the next couple of days when the itch  finally stopped. The redness/rash remained until 2 days ago on March 25. It has faded but is now a 2x2 inch brown spot on my arm. Will it go away?  3) I&#39;ve suffered with headaches and neck pain (6 on the pain scale) ever since the vaccine until yesterday, March 26. I tried taking ibuprofen and Advil but nothing helped until  it  all just suddenly disappeared overnight,

My left eye began to burn and tear profusely.    My mouth felt like it was on the side of my face and I had trouble drinking and chewing.  I  thought it was an allergic reaction to the food. Three hours later I looked at my face and was alarmed because my entire left side was paralyzed and drooping and my mouth was twisted to the right.  I rushed to  Hospital in around 6:30 pm.  After numerous test (inc brain scan) and consultation with Neurologist I was diagnozed with Bell Palsy.

Her left leg would not operate properly.  She could not swallow pills with water and her speech was slowed and slurred.  She went to the Hospital ER.  They did MRI, CT, blood test that showed she had a small stroke.  She was released to go home to do physical therapy and speech therapies.  She has both of these scheduled and will follow up w/ PCP on 4/23/2021.

                                                Had history of delayed reactions to allergy shots in past and staff administering vaccinations were concerned about whether that might possibly occur with the COVID vaccination. Many of the delay had been 48 to 72 hours.  I didn&#39;t feel like going to the Farmer&#39;s Market and by 2 pm started getting a migraine headache which had be concerned.   I had not had any fever but had had arm pain that I had used a heating pad for.  I ate Saturday.  I started noticing neck stiffness and some difficulty moving my head right and left.  I had migraine headaches from age 13 - 50 with an increase during pregnancy so I knew what they were and  what I had started to experience as the night went on into Sunday was more than I had ever  experienced in my life.  Flat on my back, ice, no intake, tylenol/codeine, nothing did anything and and the intensity kept coming.  I vomited some Sunday evening which usually helps release the pressure, but nothing helped.  I continued to have more difficulty turning my neck from side to side, visual difficulties and excruciating pain.  I had a virtual appointment with my endocrinologist and she was concerned about what was going on and gave me some guidelines lines about managing my blood sugars and suggesting that I be on the Farxiga if I went in the hospital.  I made it through another virtual meeting basically holding my head in my hands.  I canceled all my dental and doctor appointments because of the unrelenting pain and my concern for my driving. I began having some spastic jerking of the head and neck, which with the mask on forced my teeth into my front gums and lacerated the wholes front inside of my mouth. On 3/23 my husband died unexpectedly, I canceled Wednesday&#39;s Funeral Home visit because of my concern regarding driving and the extreme degree of pain.  I could barely move my neck past center.  I was also having mobility issues and my right side was working as well as it should.  Typing and writing were difficult.  My pain level was off the chart.  I had spoken with the doctor and once I did the required things at the funeral home, I took myself to the emergency room.  My pain was coming off the right lower part of my neck, affecting my vision, my appetite, my balance--basically neurologically going downhill on a fast slide since Saturday night. I told the nurse that my pain level was 20&#43;. The Spinal Tap in the ER was negative across the board and the fluid was clear.  IV&#39;s were hung to help with hydration.  Solumedrol and methacarbornol were given IV to deal with the inflammation around the vertebrae and the pain muscle spasms. Ice packs were applied to the front and pack of the neck to not only help with swelling, but with to relieve pain and help with neck alignment.  Blood sugars were a real struggle with all the prednisone on board but were helped some with the arrival of my Frixiga from home. It was the new Neurologist in the practice that looked at my posture, listened to my history and said, I am going to get some X-rays which took all day to do.  The X-rays showed that there had been swelling and shifting to make CI and C2 put pressure on the nerve. There was also a problem with L3.  A second neurologist added a morning dose of Topomax (50mg) which began to show some effect on Tuesday after being in the hospital for 5 days.  These 2 neurologist, along with the one in the ER could not rule out that what I experienced was a delayed reaction to the Moderna Vaccination, particularly as I have had delayed reactions to allergy shots in the past. It was suggested by the radiologist that a MRI be  one for a more definitive brain study as well as a spine study but the doctor on originally was doing much and didn&#39;t pick up on that. I have had to wean off of the prednisone at home which has meant wonderful monitoring of blood sugars. I have had to continue to wear the neck collar and slowly ween out of it.  I have been exhausted--the doctors think some of that may be from the muscle spasms and the fact that it took 4 days before there was a significant decrease in the intensity in the headache.  I still have to focus on posture and my right had gets very tired of the board.   Signatures are still not as  neat as they were but better than they were when I was admitted.

The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

                                                I had an adverse reaction approximately 35 minutes after my injection when I was  driving home. I had numbness on the left side of my mouth and lips which came on very quickly. This numbness was identical to the feeling of Novocain injected for dental work, except it came on much faster. My cheek and left side of the throat were swollen. I was also chilled.  The intense numbness lasted about 20 minutes. The swelling did not worsen.     12 hours later I had some numbness and swelling in the bottom left lip.  The cheek and throat swelling were gone.  24 hours following the injection I had swelling in the left side of the bottom lip and numbness in the corner of the left lip only.  36 hours later all symptoms were gone.

Went back to clinic and they gave me 2 Benadryl 50 mg and monitored my blood pressure.  Was high when I got in and after Benadryl dropped significantly.  I was told to take 2 Benadryl at 6pm which I did.  Tingling stopped with Benadryl.  Not feeling right for next 5 days with shortness of breath, chest pains and blood pressure fluctations from high to low. Went back on 1/28/2021  PA did EKG and suggested that I see my cardiologist.

I also experienced very painful redness and spots on the left side of my tongue and a sore throat. The pain made it  difficult to eat or swallow.Because I often get canker sores in my mouth, I thought that this might be that but it was different than what I usually get.  I took Benadryl, valacyclovir, Motrin, and rinsed and gargled  with various mouth washes and dry mouth products.. Salt water rinses were helpful. Today is day 5 after shot and my throat is better and tongue is better.

It helped me to clear my throat, but I did not feel like my throat was closing   Lips subsided within 1.5 to 2 hours.   Tongue finally subsided fully after about 5 hours, but I still feel a slight feeling today, as if I drank too hot of coffee.

About 40-45 minutes after injection I had a distinct sensation of swelling lips and a tightening of the throat. I stopped driving, drank some water in the car. Fortunately, this reaction did not progress and after a few minutes more began to dissipate. I drove the rest of the way home. Then a late afternoon nap. I will have Benadryl with me for the 2nd dose.

                                                I received the vaccine at 3;30 in the afternoon of 2/12/21. I felt fine and after waiting for 20 minutes, I drove home. I had no pain at the injection site and did not need any medication.  I ate dinner and went to bed at 10:30 pm.  I awoke at 1:30 am with pain in my mouth.  I had had a temporary bridge put in my upper right side of my mouth on Tuesday, 2/9/21.  I had had no pain from that dental procedure till 2/13/21 at 1:30 am.  I needed to take an Advil to relieve the pain.  After 20 minutes the pain was gone.  This pattern of waking at night with pain has continued since that night.  I called my dentist today and reported what was going on.  He told me to get in touch with the CDC and file a report.  He reported that he has heard of this pain occurring in other dental patients after having received the vaccine.

An hour after receiving the vaccine pt. stated she felt much better and left clinic ambulatory in no acute distress.  Advised if symptoms worsen to go to the ER or call 911, pt. voiced understanding.

                                                Received the vaccine and about 5-7 minutes she felt like somebody put there thumb on the right side of her throat and pushed really hard.  This got worse and worse for about 10 minutes and stayed that way for about an hour.  She was kept for 45 minutes.  Later on it got less and less and by that evening the sensation was gone.  On day 29 2/20/21 of the vaccine she started having really crazy dizzy spells, off balance, blood pressure was going up and having the shakes.  She went to the ER 02/21/21, which they did a lot of testing, and everything was fine.  They did not know if it was due to the virus.  She saw her PCP today 2/24/21 and she said that it could be from the vaccine, but again not sure.  She called the health dept and told them that she was canceling her appointment and advised that she call us to report the incident.   She has also had pressure in her chest, generally overall not feeling well over the last 3 days.

At one hour following injection, both the face and tongue numbness/ tingling was subsiding.  At  2-1/2 hours following injection there was only slight sensation on the face and tongue, akin to sensation following novocaine injection at the dentist.  At 5 hours following injection, no further symptoms.

I have never had heart palpitations from Graves before, although it is a common problem with it I have not had double vision since my eye surgery 5 years ago.  Am wondering whether to proceed with second dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                About 1 hour and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine I became dizzy.  3 1/5 hours later I developed chills which lastly briefly. The next day I had  huge area on my  left eye on my pupil which lasted for 5 days. I have blue eyes and right at toward the end of the blue I have white deposits.  On  2/24/2021 I went  see an eye doctor Dr. He diagnosed me with &#34;whiss&#34; ring around both of my eyes, and seen spot on my lenses on my left eye.  I started starburst with my left eye, this did not develop until after I received the vaccine.  I have a dot on my right eye now. On 02/26/2021 see another eye doctor Dr., he also said I have deposits around my cornea, acknowledged the starburst effect on the left eye, and noticed the &#34;whiss&#34; ring.  Since I took the vaccine my eyes have become very light sensitive.  The doctors have told me this conditions are permanent, if it gets worse they will have to scrape the eye and have a laser surgery.  I do  not remember when it started but it 2inches by 3 inches, red patch which started at the injection site and went diagonal.

My blood pressure sky rocketed to 190/82 and I am always in the 120s over 70s or so.  I went to the ER where I was given an EKG, a head CT scan, blood work was also done.  Next day I had an MRI of my head.  All was done to rule out a TIA.    Final diagnosis was probably an Ocular Migraine which I have never had.  I followed up with an eye doctor who said my eyes were fine.    Whether this was coincidental or a reaction to the Covid shot, no one could tell me.  I felt fine next day and have not had any other ocular migraines.

                                                On March 5th I woke up with low grade fever and headache, eyesight was like a veil over my eyes and I could not see well at all.  It was as if cataracts had appeared over both eyes overnight. I slept off and on all day, drank lots of liquids and took Tylenol for the fever. The symptoms cleared up at 7:00 am on March 6th. I did not take any of my medications on March 5th except for my eyedrops, that seemed to help with my vision problems.

                                                1st dose 1/29 reaction gave me little dime-sized red bumps all over my body and a lot of itchiness. I had 2 larger brown  places on my body that were oval shaped about 1 inch across and it was crusty and had liquid and blood coming  from it. One was under my left breast and at the base of my spine. I had to get a mammogram because I had brown and bloody discharge from my left nipple. It looked like someone had painted bright red paint around the nipple. Dermatologists said it was mild duct ectasia bilaterally benign, nipple dermatitis, left nipple bloody discharge, and an eczamatatious rash. Right breast had a brown bump on the areola to the side of the nipple. 03/03/21 second dose: Sore arm, Fever of 100.9 next day that lasted all day. fatigue and a headache. I also had dizziness especially when I lie down or get up. fever went down and then I developed a rash on my body that made it look like I was sunburned all over my body. not spots, just redness all over. I felt pretty weird. it was an itchy rash that stayed about 24 hours, then changed into a spotty rash that traveled to my inner arms and inner thighs. The next day it traveled down my legs to my ankles. It went away mostly after a few days. I do still have spots that look like bites that are quarter-sized brown crusty spots. then I have eczema patches on my forehead. Its flaking and itching and is too sensitive to wash with soap. Also, my right eyelid has 3-4 places that has welt on it so much so that I cant see well from the eyelid, and under eye being swollen.

They gave me prescriptions. I filled the Prednisone and took one pill a day for 7 days. Also ordered Acyclovir but I didn&#39;t  finish it because too many  side effects hitting me from pills. I am out of Prednisone and my face is still swollen. Bell&#39;s Palsey still here and active- 10 days later.

The headaches continue to this day, March 10, 2021, one month after receiving the vaccine. I reported the headaches to my GP, but he advised me to still get the second dose, scheduled for March 13, 2012. I am cancelling that appointment because of the headaches.

                                                The next day i had chills, body pain, fatigue, loss of taste, headache, weakness. But on wednesday 3/17/21 i had severe left leg pain from thigh going down, my lower leg got discolored ( darker than my normal color), dizzy, forgetful. Went to ED and my Bp was 185/69- never ever!! Blood test, leg ultrasound normal. Today i still have pain, headache, no appetite. This vaccine is the culprit.

                                                My reaction to the vaccine was: Complete and utter fatigue, going from the bed to the bathroom and back felt like I had run a marathon, I had brain fog, headache and a temperature.  I ached all over and my vision was somewhat affected.  The idea of eating took too much energy.  No one I have talked to had a reaction like mine.  I believe there is a connection between my reaction and the Valley Fever.  I would like to know if other Valley Fever survivors had similar reactions.  After 36 hours like that, I feel much better.

As a result, patient was still responsive but continued to show symptoms of anaphylaxis, paramedics arrived and escorted patient to the nearest hospital in which patient complied. Paramedics were also provided with information of what to place and what was given to the patient as a result of the anaphylactic episode.

March 7th right hand went numb again and had vision problems with right eye, cleared up in about 15 minutes.  March 9th right hand and right side of face went numb.  Went to hospital and was examined and told I was having a stroke.  I was admitted to hospital for two days.  MRI showed that I had a stroke and now have some brain tissue damage.  I and now going to occupational therapy to regain use of right hand.  The Doctors thought that it was pretty coincidental that my first stroke symptom (transient numb right hand on the 6th) started just a couple days after I got the second dose of the moderna vaccine.

They were itchy and hot to the touch and sore. 17 March 2021 my mouth, tongue, throat and lungs felt dry and irritated. 18 March 2021 the two spots had faded but still noticeable, not as itchy and sore.  I started breaking out with hives on my arms, neck, and face. They break out in different places and after several hours they fade. It it now 23 March 2021 and I am only having a few break outs in various spots on my arms, neck and face.

Into the night I began vomiting (which lasted all night)  I became feverish, had chills with body shaking, extreme nausea. (temp 102) This persisted to the next day and I went to the ER.  There I was given  multiple liters of IV fluids,  IV Zofran and IV Tylenol.   I felt better after treatment but still had the intense headache and ringing in the ears.  The next day, I&#39;m now gradually beginning to feel better, just weak.  I can eat today, two days after the injection and slowly beginning to feel better.   This reaction was terrible for me.

I also had ringing in my ears. I felt like I was going to pass out. It scared me.  I put on my brakes and started to pull over but by the time I started to pull over, the dizziness was slowly starting to clear up.  I had a &#34;foggy&#34; feeling in my head for about a half hour after so I went to my friend&#39;s house and sat down and drank some water. Then I went home.  I have had no incidents since then.

                                                My tongue began to burn and it increased in intensity and spread to the back of the mouth and throat.  I had pre-treated with an allegra. I stopped and took a Benedryl capsule and turned around and returned to the health facility. The nurses watched me for another 45 minutes during which time nothing else occured. My blood pressure was slightly depressed but not too much. It was 98/ 76 when normal for me with medication is 116- 128 over about 86=92.  I took another Benedryl when I was close to home. The burning continued but did not progress into swelling. It did feel as if I had sores in my mouth that night but they were gone in the a.m.  I felt like my tongue had been burned by much too hot food and/or beverage.

I have never had one but it appeared to be migrane.  Eyes felt the size of tennis balls and couldn&#39;t open eyes.  Could not stand any noise or any light.  Could not pick head up off pillow.  Constant swallowing like going to throw up.  Day #2 same thing.  Day #3 same thing but eyes felt like golf balls.  Eyes blood shot.  Day #4 (today) still some head ache and swollen eyes.  No energy.  Am scheduled for March 8 to have second shot.     WILL NOT.  Getting on plane on March 10 and will not take chance of this happening again.  Husband read that second shot has worse effects.  I sincerely feel like a &#34;lab rat&#34; since no one knows what happens to people after vaccines.  Would be really great if someone will contact me to explain reaction to shot.

She then said she was feeling overall unwell.  Over the subsequent 30 minutes, she described a severe headache, nausea, itching, and had trouble answering basic questions. Paramedics were called, who conducted an evaluation, which noted dizziness, vision trouble and uneven arm weakness. Paramedics determined she needed further evaluation at a hospital, and was taken to Hospital.

This was a horrifying and careless mistake.  My mother is experiencing a headache that has been intense for 48 hours now, a very large visible lump at the injection site along with a red rash.  She has had  dizziness and lightheadedness.  She also has ringing in her ears.  The main reason for filing this report is because of the error made and the concern of what other effects getting a double dose of the 1st shot will cause her.

                                                10 to 15 mins. after the injection, my tongue began to feel strange.  I thought maybe it was because I was uncomfortable with my mask.  I left at 1:25 PM without informing the pharmacy because they were running behind with Covid injections and were getting ready to close for the lunch hour.  By the time I reached home, my tongue definitely felt &#34;thick&#34; but I was able to eat and drink. The tongue thickness lasted approx. one and a half hours.  Then for the next two hours, I felt tingling or itching under my scalp -- like it was under my skull. By 5 PM the reactions were gone. These reactions were similar to when I had allergy immunization shots years ago.

                                                I do not know if this was an adverse event to the vaccine or not. It was not like an allergy reaction which I really don?t get. Felt more llike a mild flu. I have read that some people had delayed effect. It started out as a eyestrain type headache last night that  got worse then I felt  somewhat queasy like I had to throw up  which I did three times. Then I had Somewhat loose stool. It could have been another ailment but I don?t know. I was feeling fine until this happened. I had a sore arm after the injection  at  injection site for maybe three or four days but it was gone by time this happened. I did not have a fever that I know of but I did have periods of becoming chilled or  hot. I do not feel like I drink anything including water. I did not have any rash, but I did have a bruise that showed up the day before and right lower arm above my right wrist. But who knows I might have bumped my arm I  or not I just don?t know. Today I feel a little better. Able to eat Jell-O. Headache almost gone.

                                                I was perfectly fine after the vaccine, except for a sore arm. On day 3 I noticed my tongue starting to swell and lips tingling. It got a little worse and I felt it moving towards my throat, and then it stopped. This only lasted maybe a couple of hours, and not more than three hours. I had not eaten anything since the day before, so knew it was not food related. I didn?t associate this reaction to the vaccine until I searched online, and found that tongue swelling and facial paralysis could be common. I was also tired that day. On day 4 I had none of those symptoms but was very tired and did not feel myself; little energy, somewhat lethargic.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 14 Feb 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Within one minute, the nurse gave her the second dose of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided). The patient had a hard time breathing, bad headache, large redness on left arm, lightheadedness, and tinnitus (ringing in ears). The patient took ibuprofen (400 mg) on 14 Feb 2021 and 15 Feb 2021. On 16 Feb 2021, the patient took Advil (200 mg).   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The outcome of the event, within a minute of each other the nurse gave 2 full doses of vaccine, was considered resolved on 14 Feb 2021. The outcomes of the events: hard time breathing, redness on left arm, lightheadedness, tinnitus-ringing in ears, and headache is unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Patient woke up 02/27 with allergic reaction including copious mucus in nose and throat and coughing which lasted 1 hour &#43;. When recovered somewhat patient?s left lower was swollen and it felt like she had received shot of Novocain. Symptoms resolved within about 2 hr after taking 25 mg Benadryl.  Sunday evening 2/28, patient noticed itchy rash over body (mostly torso and in ?hot spots?) and mild lip numbness also. She took more Benadryl thru the night (every 4hours) helped.

I called the nurse and she had the attending Dr come to me. Dr checked my airway and said it looks beautiful but wanted me to go next door to the ED. We walked over and checked in. I think my BP was 180/100 and elevated heart rate. Nurse took me to examine room. Dr listened to my heart, checked for rash and looked in my mouth. O2 sat was constant between 96-99%. Heart rate was elevated. Right side of face was a little more  flushed than left side. Sensation continued to subside and was gone within the 90 minutes the Dr wanted to contain me. BP was down and HR lower when we left the ED, but not my normal BP No other events. Arm  sore at site of injection.

                                                pt stated that starting about 1:30 after getting the vax she had nausea and severe pain in the right arm which kept increasing in pain until she was unable to move her arm.  That night her arm was in the 9-10 range for pain.  She hasn&#39;t been able to sleep due to the pain.  The next day she took Tylenol but did not help with pain. She had a strange taste in her mouth and also loss of appetite.  On 3/6/2021  she started getting a back ache.  She tried taking Ibuprofen which helped some with swelling in her arm but not the pain.  On 3/7/2021 she started getting a headache, brain fog and saying her words backwards.  She is very upset with the lack of warning that she was given at the time of the getting the first dose of the vax about being in this type of pain afterwards.  She said she was not prepared for this.  She has to have help doing everything and lives alone. Today the arm pain seems to slightly be improving but her back is still hurting.  Pt contacted her PCP.  They only instructed her to take Tylenol and not to ice it.  She contacted the Public Health Dept they told her to take Ibuprofen and to ice it.  She is getting conflicting information and doesn&#39;t know how to treat it.

                                                After I received my first dose Moderna vaccine, I was concerned about having a virus because I was not feeling well. I had pain in chest, sore throat, ear aches and felt very tired.

                                                I first noticed a static-like buzzing in my ears on February 28th driving home  with my husband from out of town.  I thought something might be wrong with our car radio and asked my husband if he heard it.  He did, so I turned the radio off, but we both still heard the buzzing.  We both still hear it frequently.  Usually when I mention it to him, he says he hears it too, but sometimes he doesn&#39;t.  It reminds me of a field of crickets at night.

Restless night, low grade fever. Progressed within 48 hours to epigastritis, intractable nausea?started Omeprazole on 3/11.  Exhaustion lasted until Day 10 when I began to feel better and the nausea finally lifted. I do not want to go through this a second time but an asking you for guidance. I desperately want released from house confinement and separation from my children and grandchildren. Please help me with a decision of whether of not to take the second dose.

It occurred on and off for 8 or so hours , while alarming me somewhat until it finally stopped but not really distracting me much.  From what I learned, it appeared to be tinnitus.

Within 30 minutes more of my throat was tight, more of my face was tingling &amp; swelling.  Home by 45-50 minutes after injection. By then my whole face, neck, throat, was tight &amp; swollen. I was having trouble swallowing &amp; red raised itchy rash all over my body. I Took 100 mgm benedryl by mouth as soon as I got home.  I also had my epipen available. Within an hour of taking benedryl it began to reverse the effects. I took another 100 mgm of benedryl 4 hrs later. At bedtime I felt wiped out but better. Throat very faw for. Couple of days.

Began to have swallowing difficulty. I was getting a woozie feeling within 30 minutes. I took 100mgm benedryl by mouth w about a pint of water. For the next 50-60  minutes, the tightness continued as far as below my collar bones  face very tight swollen. Red raised itchy rash started all over my body.  Had epipen in hand as well as stat dose of prednisone to take if necessary.  (I have an allergic reaction protocol in hand from my doc for these cases. Transport to ER is always there if needed) . Took about an hour for the benedryl to start countering the adverse affect.  Took another 100 mgm at the 4 hr post injection time mark.  By bedtime about 10pm, I felt very fatigued, throat &amp; back of tongue very sore &amp; raw feeling.

                                                With in 3 hours of the injection, I had severe pain in my eyes.  When I examined them in a mirror, the whites of my left eyes was red within another hour it had crossed over to the right.  The pain was severe.  I had an eye antibotic that I started on Friday morning. My eyes were swollen in the eyebrow area and face below the eye by Friday night. Had severe pain until I saw Dr. on Monday.  He said my eyes were dry probably from swelling.  I took the antibotic thru Thursday as instructed.  and  used OTC eye drops  every 2 hrs. for the week following the antibotic.. The eyes are are more clear, but I still have some eye pain.  It has been 2 weeks today since  taking the covid vaccine.

After 30 minutes the patient reported no change. Gave the patient 10ml (25mg) of liquid benadryl ( 12.5mg/5ml sus)  which she said she will not take just yet but wait a little longer. took patients blood pressure which was high 160/100 (patient has history of BP) told the patient to wait inside the counseling room where I can keep a direct eye on but will check her BP again in 15 mins.  after 15 mins the patients blood pressure was 140/85. she stated that her tongue was feeling a little better but the sensation wasn&#39;t completely gone. she said that she feels comfortable leaving and that she will take the benadryl if she felt worse.  Tried calling the patient at 6:30pm but patient didn&#39;t answer.

Three days later had redness appear on the arm and then had headaches, and insomnia that night.  Her eyes were burning as well.  A day later had irregular heart beat and then six days later had the red line, raised in a circle that lasted one day.  She then continued to have the itching and then became a rash which was traveling under arm and onto her chest.  She then went to the city UC and was spreading to her breast, and started to subside.  Since then she has been having on and off headaches, on and off itching of both of her arms, as well as her scalp and other parts of her body.   As  a child had a history of hives.  When she went to the UC they did an EKG due to the irregular heart beat and did not want to go to the ER during the pandemic.  He gave her one Benadryl and 3 Ibuprofen which she only took one of, as she has a lot of allergies.  She has been taking Zyrtec 5 mg for the itching when she has it, which works for her.  The symptoms are subsiding, and has transient rashes on the vaccine arm, and on the right arm still have a few areas and still itching on and off.

                                                On 01/11/2021, within a few hours of my grandmother getting the shot her injection area became red, swollen and hot to the touch. At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

                                                30 minutes post injection-weakness, face flushed, felt minor chest constriction, lips swelled and tongue tingled. I didn&#39;t inform the observers because I felt I could handle this myself. I drank water and rested another 10 minutes until the weakness dissipated. However, the chest tightness and tongue redness and tingling continued so I contacted my primary physician who recommended Claritin or Zyrtec which I took. Most reactions have dissipated but swollen reddened tip of tongue and tingling persist - second day.

                                                About 20 minutes after receiving the shot, I started feeling uneasy.  Realized that my fingers were getting tight with swelling.  I could feet the sides of my chests getting tight - felt like pressures were building up with swelling.  I did not have problems with breathing.  About 10 minutes later I could feel my lips swelling, but stopped after about 10 minutes.  In the evening, felt nausea.  Did not feel well for two days.  Got a little better on the third day but not completely well.  Completely recovered on the fourth day.  Should I get the second shot?  I am afraid it might be worse on the second shot if what I was feeling were due to allergy.

These symptoms lasted about 35 minutes and then I was fine. I?ve never been allergic to anything so my question is should I take the second dose, since I know it is much stronger what do you advise?

The patient returned back to the vaccine clinic and was seen by EMS on scene. The patient did not complain of any shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, or vomiting. She was no longer dizzy but was still having blurred vision in her left eye.  She stated that she was seeing black lines out of the periphery of her eye.

I started having chills. when I checked my temperature it was in the 99s (the highest my temperature 101.9. When I checked my heart rate in the morning and it was in the 90s, and that&#39;s higher than normal for first thing in the morning. My heart rate went high and I had achy muscles. I sat around all day, but I didn&#39;t feel that bad in the morning, I took an extra strength Tylenol and I didn&#39;t have much have an appetite. My heart rate stayed in the 90s-130, so I called my cardiologist and he recommended I alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen and drink lots of fluids. By dinner that night I had no appetite, and then I had nausea and dry heaves, so I took 25 mg of promethazine at about 8 and the dry heaves got better within an hour. I got the COVID tongue. I had a white coating on my tongue and I couldn&#39;t get it off and a weird metallic taste in my mouth, I had a mild headache. The next day I felt much better. I called my PCP and they didn&#39;t think it was necessary for me to come in for a cardiogram because I was feeling better.

The Dr. said it was muscle pulling of my eyes.  Tomorrow I have cataract surgery. One March 4th I have a follow up to discuss the double vision. If I cover one eye then I can see fine,  but when I look with both eyes I am still seeing double vision.

If I tried to in my sleep the pain would awaken me. The next day after my shot at about 10 AM I began to feel wonky (dizzy) and tired.  For the entire rest of the day I had to literally lay around which is unusual for me as I&#39;m very active. I was too tired to do anything--extreme fatigue. The night was the worst.  I had a fever and sweats and  horrible  dry mouth.  I woke up about 3 times an hour throughout the night because of the dry mouth and had to drink water.  I drank three 16 fl oz bottles of water.  I had to urinated 5 times in the night. [normal for me is I never wake to urinate.   I go to bed about 11 pm and wake up at 7.  Today I feel normal except my arm is still tender from the shot.

Your format is not set-up to put two shot information well. So:  on 1/31/2021 my wife received her first COVID-19 shot.  a week after the injection she developed a                                     large red rash at the injection site about 3 inches in diameter...it lasted a few days and                                      dissipated.           On  2/28/2021 my wife received her second  COVID-19 shot.  the evening of that vaccine                                       she developed severe muscle aches and  a very bad eye infection that swelled and itched.                                       we are a week out and the symptoms ar just now beginning to subside.

                                                It began with a metallic taste in the back of the throat about 15 minutes after the shot was administered (February 16).  In an hour my tongue and lips were tingling and my throat was swelling slightly.  I called the pharmacy and was advised to take Benadryl.   I took doses at 4:00 and 10:00 PM that day and at 11:00  AM the next day (February 17).  By 3:00 PM I could feel tingling and swelling in my throat, lips and tongue.  I called my primary care doctor.  She told me to take more Benadryl and go to the ER.   She told me not to get the second vaccine.   I went to the ER and they checked me out, observed me and gave me a steroid shot.  The ER doctor also told me not to get the second shot, that the risks would outweigh the benefits.   He gave me a prescription for steroids and an epi-pen.   I still felt some swelling in my throat for about a week.   Since then I?ve been fine.

She attributes this to her vaccine. Immediately after receiving the vaccine she felt completely fine without any side effects. One night ago she began to feel like she was getting an ear infection with some pain and pressure to her right ear. Today, she noticed some swelling to the right side of her neck. She also feels dehydrated as she has not been eating or drinking much. Additionally, she endorses some agitation last night.

                                                Gross muscle and tendon and cartiledge pain.  I have bad side effects from taking motrin, ipuprofen, asprin, etc.   I did camomile, a couple of times did the colchicine in case the shot ingredients were making that click in....  but aspects of this was worse.  And I did some CBD during the day sometimes.   Still did the gaba and CBD at night.   Sometimes the pain was so bad it burned.   Bad heache that got worse with concentration, extremely dry eyes that eye drops didn&#39;t help, gastric  problems worse than I&#39;m used to, ate less.  I worried about long term leftover inflammation.    things are much better now, but still get the heache at a lower level off and on.   From old injuries, my muscles are weaker because I&#39;ve rested too much.   My need to sleep was extreme and I was taking long naps during the day and sleeping at night.   That happened even when I wasn&#39;t taking the daily time CBD.   It has been three weeks now and the pain is 99% gone.   I can concentrate better.  Etc.    I also want to report something many of my friends are reporting... and that is a sense of euphoria after the shot.  I also had that.  BUT I know that that can be caused by a kick into effect of hormones.   And I think one or more of the ingredients are apt to cause that (like the hydrocarbons/plastics).  they can serve as synthetic hormones.   People are thinking that the euphoria was psychological because of relief.   I know better and I want this explained to people.   It is not ok to let them believe this.

                                                8 days after injection I developed left head tingling/tenderness in left scalp, left external ear, left neck. Yesterday, my left jaw hurt, as well, as did my internal ear. I was talking to my M.D. about an unrelated issue, yesterday,  mentioned what I was experiencing, and he wanted me to report it to the CDC site. I still have it and I am taking Ibuprofen twice a day now with relief. I have no swelling, redness, vesicles, just tenderness, as I would imagine a neuralgia symptom.

I verified that my vision had changed by sitting in front of my computer and doing several normal tasks that I had done on 3/1 during my normal work day.  I all cases it was apparent that my  distant vision had substantially changed. It was true for both eyes. I saw an ophthalmologist who said their was no organic  problems but suggested cataracts. I asked if cataract s could change so dramatically and also asked how my cataracts compared to the last visit. Basically nada.  Since I work on the computer every day  as a CPA

                                                Within forty minutes of receiving the vaccine, the back of my tongue felt &#34;fat&#34;, no other way to describe it. Within an hour, my arms and legs were tingling and felt numb, much like when a leg or arm falls asleep, with intermittent chills running down the limb then gone. I had five episodes of tachycardia on 3-12-21, only two brief episodes today, 3-13-21.  48 hours later and I still experience a brief surge of the numb and tingling feeling, but it&#39;s so much better. The vaccination site itched profusely but that has eased.  I began taking Benadryl and Advil approximately four hours after receiving the vaccine and it did help.

A week after getting the vax her right arm was itchy, red, swollen at and below the injection site that lasted four days.  She used ice pack which seemed to help.  About 2 weeks later she had body aches and pain within her back, pelvis, shoulders, legs, and head.  She had a pulsating pain that starts in the base of her neck and goes up the left side of her neck into her ear and then quits and starts again.

                                                After Moderna Dose #1 Within one day of vaccination the person experienced extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, joint achiness, headache, and nausea.  She felt feverish and chilled but had no fever.  She noted nightmares , hard to focus, eye sensitivity, abdominal pain and about 10days after vaccination had an episode of thick saliva and drainage so that she had to sleep upright.  These symptoms progressed for about a week and then slowly resolve completely by about 3 weeks post vaccination.     After Moderna Dose #2  - RN spoke with client 1 week after dose #2. Within one day of vaccination she experiences intense fatigue, headache on day 2, light sensitivity, body aches in joints and muscles, her arm felt hot, swelling of her breasts, no appetite, and abdominal pain, She did NOT experience any rashes or itching or difficulty breathing.  Her symptoms were so incapacitating that she could not do any of her ADL&#39;s and could only relieve her pain by lying down in bed all day.  As soon as she tried to move around the intense joint pains returned and she had to lie down.  Normally she treats her arthritis with Colchicine as needed but received no relief.  After a few days she did try one dose of Allegra (antihistamine) with some relief.  Resting by lying down in bed for a week has been her only relief.  She did not indicate any allergies to PEG.

This worsened with itching and pain to eyes. Additionally I had difficulty focusing my mind and a general feeling of being ?unwell?.  Benadryl 60 mg reduced the eye discomfort.

I was in the hospital for two days and had a series of CAT scans and ultrasounds.  Loud ringing in my head has not stopped. Never had a history of high blood pressure, but now they put me on high blood pressure medication along with the baby aspirin. I was a relatively healthy woman until I had these vaccinations.

Five days later, swollen/painful left jaw and earache in left ear.  Did not respond to Tylenol.  Doctor prescribed Doxycycline for possible ear infection. Problem with antibiotic after only one day, so discontinued. Pain/swelling in jaw slowly subsided.  Earache lessened, but still would come and go to lesser extent.  Second Moderna dose 3/16/21 - same expected reactions for about 48 hours.  Swollen jaw did not return, but earaches (now in both ears) come and go.  Some tinnitus in both ears, but on and off.  Neither earaches nor ringing in ears is constant, but of concern.  One month past second Moderna dose and the ear involvement persists.

I left the waiting room at 11:55.  One hour later, I had an extremely dry mouth &amp; needed water.  It resolved after drinking a bottle of water.  At 4:30pm I started itching in my hands, feet, &amp; entire body - itchiness was like prickles, not normal itching.  Took Claritin which kept itching under control.  I have taken Claritin 10mg daily for the last 5 days to keep itching under control. Today I am more itchy than yesterday.

She felt weak and tired  after this episode and so went back to bed for several hours.  Later that day she had another episode of feeling lightheaded as if she might pass out, while sitting at a hair salon waiting for her appointment, but did not actually pass out, just felt a wave of heat and slight nausea, but did not faint.  She had one further near syncopal episode at home later that night when she also noticed she was a little &#34;jittery&#34; and noted a strange smell that the rest of her family did not notice.    She also reports that she has had near syncopal episodes in the past and thinks she may have been a little dehydrated the day these incidents occurred.

                                                Five days after injection the site became red and itchy, a rash broke out on the arm and them spread to back, arms, hands, legs, on Day 6 woke with swelling of lips and face.  Went to urgent care on advice of personal dr.  Prescribed Hydrozine, Pepcid, Predinsone with caution to wait on Pred if possible.  Hydrozine seem to make things worse, liquid Benadryl offered some relief.  After two more days started Prednisone.  Swelling started to come down after a day on Pred.  Rash still prevelant but slightly less itchy.  Six days of pred did not kill rash.  Second round of Pred finally calmed the rash.   I believe this to be PEG allergy based on reviewing med history

On the 4th day I started getting itching, my eyes were watering and itching, my head and hair was itching, my face was itching, my skin was itching. I had a runny nose. I had headaches, sever chills, nausea and sweating. That lasted for 6 full days.  I did call my doctor&#39;s office and talked to the nurse, she found an urgent care center close to my home, and told me if I felt like I needed to go that would be the place to go.

                                                5-10 minutes after I received the vaccine I had a headache. At first it wasn&#39;t bad, however, that afternoon it worsened and did not improve with Tylenol or Advil. The next day was worse than the first because the headache became very bad and I was unable to do anything besides rest on the sofa. The following day I felt somewhat better but the headache persisted along with eye irritation, burning, and pain. That continued for 2 more days. My headache worsened on Tuesday, February 16. I awoke with a pounding headache in the back of my head. It caused me to become nauseous for several hours which improved by the afternoon.I&#39;ve have never had a migraine but think that&#39;s what this was.  I rested the entire day. Today, Wednesday, February 17, I awoke with a mild headache which worsened during the day. Along with this my eyes ached and I noticed reading words and numbers was difficult because they were blurry. I decided to hold off on taking any pain medication to see whether or not the headache would calm down and it hasn&#39;t; it tends to move around my head during the day. Hopefully, the Tylenol will help today.

On 2/11 I was exhausted, still thirsty, had muscle aches (especially in my calves) and dull headache.. On 2/12 I felt better in the AM. but by afternoon all symptoms returned, lower back ached, I was queasy. On 2/13 I felt better but was very tired.   After that I felt more like myself for the next 5 days.  Today, 2/18 at 3PM I developed a rash at the injection site.  It was very itchy.  I used calamine lotion to calm the rash, which helped.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the Maderna vaccine my head started hurting which I reported to the doctor on site. She talked to me and said I was ok to go. My headache pain persisted all day and into the next. For the pain I took Tylenol and Advil. The pain has not let-up since the day of my vaccination. In addition to the head pain, I started sneezing and had terrible eye irritation with burning and watering. These side effects are still persisting. The worst, however, is the severe head pain which only settles down when I sleep. I am sleeping only 3-4 hours at night now. I wake up for a bathroom break at 3-4 A M and can&#39;t go back to sleep. My head pain starts after I get up every morning about 1/2 hour to an hour. My doctor recommended taking Extra Strength Tylenol and Advil alternating them and an antihistamine. Functioning day to day and making decisions has been very difficult. But, the pain is the worst!!!

I was unable to read at this point. It lasted about 15 minutes and the blurriness  (both eyes) remained all day.  This could also be a result of diabetes. I have an appointment with an ophthamologist in 3 days.

Started up again that evening, took 2 Benadryl, and they calmed down.  Feb. 26  More hives in the morning, not as bad. Calmed down when I rubbed alcohol on them. Started Allerfex in the afternoon, but still got a few hives in the evening, same locations. Feb. 27 - Woke up with hives on both arms inside elbows and on right side of face and puffiness under right eye, gradually calmed down.

                                                On the day of the vaccine I got nauseous about 12:00. This lasted until bedtime.  Throughout the night I experienced chills, an earache and my skin was very sensitive to the touch. Upon rising about 9:00 those symptoms went away and I became nauseous again and my bones aches like I had the flu. Woke up the second day after the vaccine and I am completely well. It is like a switch gets turned off and your well again!!

                                                I got the shot at 11:45am and at 11:50-12:20 they had me sit in a chair and wait to see if I have an allergic reaction because of my allergy history. I sat for 30 minutes. At 12:20 the nurse said my face looked red. she took me to another area to take my blood pressure and said my face looked red and blotchy. at 12:25 2 more nurses came back and asked me how I was feeling and I told them my throat was getting scratchy and tight and felt like it was closing off. the inside of my mouth started feeling tingly/prickly and my tongue felt thick. My throat started closing off more and my lips started getting tingly and prickly. I started losing my voice as my throat was getting really constricted and I was getting shaky. At 12:30 a nurse gave me a half dose of epinephrine and called for an ambulance. At 12:40 the ambulance took me to the ER in the city. Then at 12:50 I arrived at the ER and they took me back and hooked me up to BP and O2 monitors and did blood tests. I was there until 3:30 pm that day. My BP was going up and down the whole time and I was very shaky. ER Doctor told me to NOT take the second vaccine dose and prescribed me an EpiPen.

                                                within one hour, little light headed.  Within l hour 45 minutes headaches off and on on right side front and behind right ear.  The roof of mouth had a strong burning sensation then the top lip and area above top lip went numb and tingling.   Arm pain which improved with massaging and swinging arm.  Within 3 hours of the vacination, most of numbness and tingling gone from upper lip and above upper lip.  From time of vacination, I drank at least one glass of water an hour and swung and massaged arm as needed.   Within five hours, almost all  adverse symptoms were gone..I was left with a slight headache across forehead and back of head. Slept well that night; no fevers.  Morning after shot, slight headache but fine. But by 8:30 a.m. I was very, very tired.  Arms and legs felt almost too heavy to move or lift, and I felt a little &#39;out of it&#39;.  Slept 1 1/2 hours.  No energy, sat around entire day, drinking about 6 glasses of water.  No energy and tired rest of day.   Next morning all symptoms except slight headache were gone so I worked in the yard for about an hour.   My temperature was normal during the entire experience.

Hospital admission that evening. 2/26 Steroid treatment stopped headaches and eye pain. 2/27 released from hospital after BP was &lt;160.  Diagnosis-migraines possibly triggered by vaccine.  Pain/nausea elevated BP and decreased food intake which caused low blood sodium levels. IV treatments to increase sodium and lower BP. Dizziness from low sodium and high BP created fall risk, so bed had alarm.  Bed confinement necessitated daily injections to prevent blood clots.  Twice daily blood tests done to monitor sodium and potassium levels &#43; kidney function.

After 2 1/2 days, the fever and chills, headache, and nausea had subsided. The tinnitus is the same as it&#39;s been since 3/17 (meaning worse than it&#39;s been over the past several decades), dizziness is mostly okay, some hearing loss is still noticeable when I am speaking with people who are wearing masks.

                                                Within 1 minute I started feeling a rush in my throat and a metallic taste, then a tingling in both arms.  That subsided for a minute or two, then started again with a flush feeling down my body.  Nurse took blood pressure 140/80.  Breathing fine. Heart rate fine.  Flush feeling started again, and blood pressure dropped  to100/70.  I was then given 50 mg of Benadryl and an ambulance was called.  My blood pressure stabilized but I was very shaky.  It was recommended that I go to the hospital for observation for a couple of hours, which I did.  I only had the flush feeling once at the hospital.  I was released after two hours.

This started shortly after the injection, It subsided after about 15 to 20 minutes. This is similar to reactions that I&#39;ve had to flu vaccines when I last had one nearly 25 years ago.  It is also similar to my reaction to numbing shots where epinephrine is in the shot.

I took some Benadryl and the symptoms resolved.  I woke up around 6AM on 1/24 and the symptoms were back.  I took more Benadryl and the symptoms resolved .

When I got there the symptoms had resolved again  The Doctor determined that  my Asthma had been exacerbated by the Vaccine.I was treated with intravenous steroids and Benadryl.  I was also treated by the Respiratory HCP with Albuterol - 4 puffs at 3:30PM and again at 6:00PM with 2 puffs of Albuterol.  I was given a prescription for Prednisone 50mg  for 5 days. I was released at 6;30PM.   I felt fine after coming home.  I saw my healthcare specialist on 1/25.  It was a scheduled appt.  and I told him about my side effects and he told me to please report them to you and to my Primary healthcare provider.

Both the nausea and severe migraine lasted for 54 hours after onset.  The first evening I also experienced teeth-chattering chills.  Finally saw an improvement around 2:00 a.m. on Monday morning, February 1, when I woke up in a total sweat.  By daylight on February 1, the nausea and migraine were  gone, but I experienced mild dizziness and blurry vision.  By Tuesday morning, February 2, I am more or less back to normal, although my vision is still a bit blurry and the dizziness still present if I move my head too quickly.

                                                Came home after vaccine, and felt bump in her arm where the injection was.  Didn&#39;t think too much of it.  The next morning her cousin came over and compared notes, and verified she had the bump.  She kept rubbing it and massaging it to break it down, and got a little sore, but nothing severe.  No sickness, a little pain over her eye.  Then on Friday 1/29/21, noticed a small spot on her arm, by Saturday got bigger, and today it has started moving to the bottom side of her upper arm.  Is applying ice and it&#39;s getting better.   Has been exercising it and stretching it as literature she found to do that.

                                                On Wednesday on the 10th when I woke up I had a rash on both of my forearms. A couple of hours later I looked at it and it disappeared. Then I looked at my right arm where I got the shot and at the injection site, there is a like red spots in the circle (looked like chicken pox). When I woke up on Thursday when I woke up it spread from a circle to a rectangle shape and completely filled in with some little red spots. It has been itching. Yesterday I spoke with my doctor and they said to take some Benadryl and put ice on it and that is was okay to put Corizatone 10 cream on it.  My doctor said if it spread to call them back. I did not have Benadryl yesterday so I started taking it this morning. It appeared lighter in color after putting the cream on it. I got up early this morning and it disappeared and when I woke up this morning it was back again. This has been going on and off for the last couple of days I have had a slight cough and scratchy throat. For the last couple of weeks I have had a runny nose and been sneezing on and off this I think it connected to my allergies.

                                                I began having a reaction on the evening of 2/19 with a sore arm and scratchy throat. The next morning, I developed shaking chills, slight nausea, headache, and low grade temp 99-100. I also noticed swollen glands and muscle aches and pain in my back. That lasted about 28 hours. After that I had nerve pain in my neck and all my teeth were painful. I went to bed. I have fibromyalgia so I thought that I may be triggered into a flare. The acute symptoms subsided in a few days, but I then had  intermittent sudden nerve pain, cold spells and hot flashes, a recurrence of irritable bowel like symptoms, with occasional diarrhea (uncharacteristic for my IBS-C). I had to visit my osteopath (for osteopathic manipulation) twice in two weeks for the pain.  She suggested that my symptoms were more than a typical flare and that I should report to VAERS. Yesterday, 3/9 I began to feel exhausted. Last night I had severe systemic  itching that kept me awake much of the night. Today the fatigue continues along with temperature dysregulation. I have contacted my PCP and am awaiting an appointment confirmation.

Also upset stomach, started not being able to taste food (metallic taste), and was able to start tasting food yesterday.  She has stayed in the house all week, sometimes feels jittery, she just gets this feeling and surprises her.  She woke up last night during the night and the upper arm were hurting and the hand and arm were numb again.  She keeps exercising the arm which helps some, but it has to go away on it&#39;s own and it continues to come and go.  She took Tylenol 2-3 days for the headache.  Two days after the vaccine her normal temp if 97.6, and 2 days after it was almost 100 but that went away and has had no temperature since.  Called her doctor and the vaccine center and they told her to call her doctor and she has an appointment on Monday.
