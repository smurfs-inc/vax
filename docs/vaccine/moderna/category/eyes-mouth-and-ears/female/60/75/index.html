I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

                                                After sitting  for about 10 minutes, I noticed my tongue was swelling up in the back of my throat. I noticed my airway was narrowed and tongue felt very tight, but I was still able to breath. I told the man at the doorway assigned to help people find a seat after their shots. He said, &#34;We all have different reactions,&#34; brought me water, and I drank it.  After another 10 minutes, the symptoms were the same, not better not worse. After 10 more minutes the symptoms were better. And after another 10 minutes, I left.  When I made it back to my car, I noticed tightening across my forehead. This developed into a frontal lobe headache which continued off and on for the next 3 days. Also noted for the next 2 days was waking with swollen lips, face and extremities, and occasional ringing in the ears lasting 1-2 hours.

                                                Within a few minutes of injection had tingling sensation in tongue, followed by a couple days of increased stomach gas, tons of burping, some reflux, took Prevacid. Tongue seemed to affected during the first several days, especially along the sides, red. Didn&#39;t get concerned at first.  The common sore arm, cleared up within a few days. On about day 10 noticed large area on arm where injection given, warm red area about 4 inches by 3 inches, itchy, resolved on own by day 14 or 15.  The next week (third week) mouth seemed to be getting more sore, swallowing harder, took prevacid. Today, day 27, mouth is sore, especially noticeable along sides where there are circle looking ulcerations where surface tissue seems to be missing. Very discouraged. Doubt I feel able to receive second dose which has been postponed, by myself, until day 30. Seeing primary doctor on day 30.

After 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine, I woke up the 2nd day with my neck lymph glands completely swollen, my jaw hurt really bad, and every tooth in my mouth hurt, and I had another infected tooth on the other side of my mouth.  I had to take an antibiotic for both tooth infections.  Teeth were not infected prior.  By the end of day 2, my lymph nodes were back to normal using Advil for swelling.

I thought it would go away but the discomfort is now when I have Range of Motion upward and the discomfort is in my shoulder, arm area and a little below the injection site. I still am having that discomfort and in addition to that, that past 7 days I have been having neck and jaw pain like in the node areas front and back of my next. As well as my lower lip has has two episodes of swelling but it goes down and then it feels ok. I generally overall just don?t feel well.  Eye and head pain as well.  I thought it was best that this be reported cause I just don?t know what is going on. I have made an appointment with my doctor which is on Feb 5.

I used slow breathing methods to try to reduce my shaking. I used an extra large heating pad with 4 blankets but could not get my body warm. I felt like i was suffering from hypothermia. I moved my heating pad around to large body parts to try to warm individual body parts to  slow my severe shaking.  My  severe shaking and extreme chills  went on for at least 4 hours. I felt nauseous and felt like I might vomit. I got in shower at 6;30 am to get into a hot shower. I could not lift my left leg without extreme pain in my lower left back. The pain in my back then moved to my hips, then my upper right side. I had diarrhea for 2 days and indigestion after eating small bits of food.   I took Tylenol gel caps on Sunday morning with a full glass of water and went to sleep at 10:00 am. I woke up with my hip joints and left ear pain.

My blood pressure readings 140/70, 166/76, 144/80 and 161/89. My doctor put me on BP medication, Metoprolol to take for a few days. I also experienced jaw pain and I went to the dentist where an x-ray was done, which was negative. I was also put on antibiotics due to a suspected middle ear infection. I felt like I had a spiral headache.  I saw my PCP, nurse practitioner who gave me a steroid injection which helped. I have cancelled my second dose injection. I have been sick for 4 weeks. I still have the jaw pain with a ringing sensation to my left ear.  Tomorrow I will go get more tests done. I am also having swollen neck with lymph nodes swollen.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

                                                After receiving the vaccine on Thursday I had a very metallic taste. Shortly after breakfast on the morning of the 25 I had a lump in my throat as though my food didn&#39;t go all the way down. Then, as the day wore on I got more &amp; more fatigued; later in the day my lips were mildly numb. I had no appetite at supper time and started getting a headache along with chills. All day Saturday I had flu-like symptoms, chills (no fever) extreme tiredness and a dull headache and laid under a blanket all day, no energy. Saturday evening around dinner time I started feeling better and Sunday woke up feeling as though nothing had happened other than a dull headache and soreness at the injection site.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

                                                Not being able to breathe; Could not smell; Positive covid test; A spontaneous report  was received from a consumer concerning a 60 years old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and could not smell, positive COVID test, and not being able to breathe.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported by the reporter. Concomitant medications taken by the patient included blood thinner.  On 4 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received first of their two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 002a21a) through intramuscular route at unspecified site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 6 Mar 2021, the patient was tested positive for COVID and could not smell. On 9 Mar 2021, the patient was hospitalized because of her not being able to breathe. On 15 Mar 2021, patient was released from the hospital.   Treatment activities for event was done with regeneron, dexamethasone, remdesivir.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of event could not smell, positive COVID test, not being able to breathe was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: COVID-19 In this patient is unlikely to be due to Moderna&#39;s mRNA-1273 vaccine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I recently retired after 37 years and now stay and provide significant weekly care for my elderly parents.  Because I am a primary caregiver for my parents, and have been throughout the months of the pandemic, I explored various potential paths to ethically and appropriately get in line for a vaccination.  When I took my mother in for her second vaccination at the Health Department in late in March I was able, while my mother was waiting, to converse with a county public health care worker about options and avenues for me to obtain the vaccine as well. She could see, clearly, that I was a caregiver for my mother, so she took down my name and number, and she called me the next day to say that I could, as a caregiver, proceed to sign up for their next clinic vaccination day that would be happening on Thursday, April 1st.   I arrived for my noon vaccination time at the Health Department before 12 on Thursday, April 1st. I proceeded through the check in line and screening questions, and arrived at vaccination site #1 at 12:05 where I was promptly given the Moderna vaccine (lot #026B21A).  Within seconds of the injection, I knew that I was having a reaction. My heart immediately began pounding, my tongue swelled and the room disintegrated into swirling flashes of color. I looked into the kind eyes of my vaccinator and remember distinctly saying to her in those first few post-injection seconds that, I was, ??sorry, but I think that I am having a reaction.?  The vaccinator then took me over to the nursing site coordinator who proceeded to check and record my vitals. I do not have that sheet with the vitals that she recorded, but I do remember that my heart rate and blood pressure measures were high. I sat as she continued to monitor me.  After 20-30 minutes, as best I can recall, my vitals were not improving, but remained elevated and even seemed to be trending higher. Also, the swelling and tingling in my tongue was worsening and seemed to be spreading to my lips and face, and down to the base of my neck.  I began to feel dizzy, like I was going to faint, so she had me lay on the floor with my legs elevated.  Additionally, it was becoming more difficult to breath because of the pressure in my neck. She had earlier and initially offered me Benadryl for the symptoms I was experiencing but I did not previously have good luck with Benadyrl the one time I took it, and also was unsure if I would have been able to swallow it. At 12:40 she thus gave me an injection of epinephrine (3mL) in my thigh and an ambulance was called. I was transported to the ER at the hospital. (Please note that the nursing site coordinator provided top-notch, high quality care through-out my entire emergency medical reaction experience, and I am very grateful and appreciative of her professional and caring response.)  In ER they monitored my blood pressure and pulse, and other aspects of my heart rhythm, as well as the swelling and tingling that continued in my tongue, lips, face and forehead.  I met with the Dr., and worked with RNs during my time there where they continued to monitor me for a number of hours. By about 4:30, when my vitals had returned to normal and stabilized for over an hour, they released me from the hospital. Since my release from the hospital, late in the afternoon on Thursday, April 1, I have noted only a few, relatively minor persisting symptoms which have included tongue, lip and face numbness and tingling. Also, I have noted, from time to time, some periods of continued heart rate elevation, though wonder if it is more of an almost ?PTSD? type of reaction than a pure physiological response, since, for example, just retelling this story right now is causing my heart rate to rise as I recall what happened.  Needless to say, this vaccination induced medical event, explained above, made for a surreal and frightening day unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Processing of it, and grappling with its implications, from concrete to existential, is seeming equally daunting, and it is here where I have a range of questions for which I am seeking assistance and perspective from the CDC:  The most concrete types of vaccination questions first: They indicated I should not try to obtain the second dose of the Moderna vaccine but that I should consult and maybe it could be given to me in a hospital setting? I welcome thoughts and feedback on how to proceed to become ?fully vaccinated.? What about another vaccine?  What about the additional boosters now being discussed for the new variants? Will I need to consider a ?cave dwelling? of some type for myself in the future since I will not have the vaccination card that is being discussed as ?the ticket to travel? in the future?  Will there be special cards for folks like me who tried but for whatever strange immunological reason was not able to take the vaccine? Increasingly complex, bigger picture questions next: Would any type of ?reach-out? to Moderna be in order? Or, do you, at the CDC, reach out to Moderna for me as a result of this VAER? Are they studying people like me?  My sense, from what little reading I have done, is that what happened to me, though severe, is rare, though definitely want the producers of the vaccine to know about my experience. Bordering on existential questions: What does this mean for me and my life going forward? Should I meet with Moderna, or some type of allergy specialist to better understand what may have happened, and what I will need to watch out for in the future? As everyone begins sharing vaccination cards and experiences, what should I say? I don?t want to scare others away from doing what is needed to save lives by sharing my experience, and don?t want to fuel the ?anti-vaxers.? What about the lingering disquiet and unease that something I sought to help and protect me seems like it might have/nearly killed me? The pandemic has already shaken and taken so much in so many of our lives.  Immunization seemed to promise to give back some of what the pandemic has taken, yet, feeling now that ?normal? is not only more distant but possibly will not be achievable for folks like me, rare though we seem to be?

                                                At approximately 3:30 pm the next day (27 hours later), I noticed significant tearing from both eyes, while outside walking. When I returned home, and checked in the mirror, I noticed significant puffiness around the eyes (though not to the point of closure or impaired vision), especially in the inner corners (L&gt;R). I contacted my PCP at 4:45 pm and was instructed to go to the Urgent Care. I was seen there and evaluated, then was discharged without any treatment plan. I had no other symptoms and felt great, and even felt the puffiness had subsided a little bit by the time I left the clinic. Today, 1/8/2021, at 7:30 am awakening, the eyes are quite puffy again, and my nose actually appears a bit swollen on the sides near the eyes. I hear clicking sounds in my sinuses and have a small amount of sinus pressure. I applied ice packs to the eye lids in an effort to reduce swelling, which seems to help a little.   Please note that I had botox in my forehead and around the outside corners of the eyes, and dermal filler under the eyes (12/7/2021), this being the first time for the filler.

All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

                                                After I received my shot I was waiting  the required 15 minutes when my throat became scratchy, thinking nothing about I left and while driving I notice I was having trouble swallowing and my mouth was dry. However, I could breathe easily so I just remained to relax and slowly swallowing my salia over and over again. Once home took a benedryl and was able to drink water without any problems. My throat is still somewhat scratchy after 2 hours.

                                                10 minutes after receiving vaccine I had sudden sharp pains in my right ear.  I have had extensive surgery in and around that ear due to cholesteatoma and perilymph fistula, and I have had some nerve damage to the balance nerve.  The bones of hearing have been removed and replaced with titanium artificial bones that do not work, so I am deaf in that ear.  These pains were severe, as if a number of steak knives were stabbing me at once, but the pain only lasted about a minute and subsided.  3 or 4 minutes later the pain recurred exactly as before but lasted a shorter duration and at a lower level of pain.  The ear felt congested the rest of the day and I avoided driving after getting home.  I have had no further problems, except that I went for more dental work on 2/8, and had a dizzy spell after getting anesthetic, maybe a little heart racing for just 5 minutes or so.

It felt very odd and was very scary. I had no tingling  in my lips or in my throat. I could speak, drink water and eat. The sensation lasted approximately 5 hours until it felt somewhat back to normal.  I have my second doze of the Moderna vaccine scheduled for March 5. I am worried about getting it after having this reaction.  Please advise me.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

                                                On Wednesday, March 24th my husband and I got our 1st Moderna vaccine at 8:30 am. Felt good the rest of the day. On Thursday, March 25th I woke up and the bag under my right eye was really swollen and I felt like I had a big cold sore coming out on the top right side of my lip. My arm was swollen like a 2x2 area and tender but other than that I felt good. At 9:30 am that same day I started getting a headache and my stomach felt really upset. I didn&#39;t throw up but felt like I was going to.  About 10:00 am I really felt sick to my stomach and extremely tired. My headache was more intense and mostly on my right side (same side as my eye and cold sore). By noon I had the chills and was running a temperature over 100. At 3:00 when I got done with work I slept. I was only awake for a total of 1 hour and went to bed for the night at 8:15 pm. I still had a bad headache, upset stomach and chills and my arm was swelling bigger but I slept all night. On Friday, March 26th I woke up and my face looked worse. The cold sore was getting bigger and the bag under my eye was huge making my eye almost shut. I still had  a bad headache and the injection site was getting bigger and stuck out far. It was hot to the touch. It was bright red and bumpy and hurt to touch it. I no longer was sick to my  stomach and I had no fever. My face was still looking awful and about 2:00 pm I started running a fever again. I still had a headache. I still felt tired. On Saturday March 27th, my bag under my eye looked a little better but the cold sore was getting worse. I had a slight headache, no fever and not sick to my stomach. However, the lump at the injection site got huge.  It was the size of the palm of my hand and stuck up about an inch. It was hot to the touch and red.  By 9:00 pm my eye and face were worse and the right side of my face was drooping. On Sunday March 28th 8:00 am my face was worse and itchy. The cold sore was spreading up the right side of my drooping face and my eye was almost shut. I called the Teledoc and had a video call. She said that the vaccine triggered a virus in my system. She called in a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM 4 pills. Took 2 pills at noon and then the last 2 that night before bed. She said to give it 2-3 days and it should clear up. On Monday, March 29th 6:30 am the lump in my arm is a little smaller but my eye is worse. I looked horrible. On Tuesday, March 30th I still had a low grade headache and my lip and right side of my face is kinda numb. I called my doctor and made an appointment for Wednesday, March 31st. On Wednesday, March 31, 2021, I woke up and now had a canker sore inside my top lip on the right side of my face in addition to looking like a monster. I went to the doctor?s office at 7:30 am and she said that I definitely have a virus going on and now I have Bell?s Palsy as a result. The doctor gave me a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM tablets to take 3 times a day for 7 days. She also prescribed Prednisone 20 MG to take 3 tablets for 7 days to relief the itching and irritability of my face.

On March 19, 2021 she was on the floor laying beside of the bed and my father noticed blood looking stuff on her shirt and bed covers. She was really confused and lethargic. She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

                                                I stayed my 30 minutes as directed in a room since I have needed IV Benedryl in past with blood transfusions. Toward the end of my 30-minute wait, I noticed my lips tingling/swelling.    I ALWAYS carry an antihistamine with me, so  I walked out to my car and noticed that my lips felt full.  I needed to run my tongue around them and I immediately took a Zyrtec.  I never did feel short of breath, but with many times in my life getting giant hives due to allergies/ blood transfusion ( secondary to my hemophilia), I feel this was a type of allergic reaction.  I&#39;ve never had the lip-tingling thing before with any other vaccine.  I&#39;ve had both pneumonia and both Shingrix vaccines and always get my influenza vaccine since I&#39;m immunosuppressed and work in a Doctors office daily.

I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

Then 02/01/21 exactly one week later had a strange feeling in my head not a headache not dizzy just felt an unusual feeling in my head of not feeling quite right especially with movement then 2 hours later had a ringing in my ears have no ear infection noting unusual im an RN and would report any other conditions. then  that evening i began feeling itchy at my injection sight but i was just iching it though my clothes and wondered why i&#39;m so itchy on my shoulder I really didn&#39;t think about the shot as it was 7 days later. The itchy feeling continued so I went to the bathroom took my shirt off and saw a rash which i will include pictures of the rash if I could. i was alarmed and concerned about the big rash and the papules sticking up.  It&#39;s now the next day 02/02/21 I still have a big rash on my arm it&#39;s about 6 inches long 3 inches wide red elevated.  I googled it and it said it was the covid arm or something.  I am willing to provide pictures

By 5:00, my eyes were itchy and burning like they were on fire, then my throat, nose, ears, and then my hands swelled up and itched and felt like they were on fire.  I also had chills.  I took Tylenol and Benadryl and also felt the need to increased my Flovent HFA 220 mcg from once a day to twice a day on Tuesday and Wednesday.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl when and as the symptoms reappeared.  I only needed Benadryl Wednesday night and woke up this morning with a bit of a headache.  Took Tylenol and went to work today.  I feel tired and my hands still hurt this afternoon(Thursday 2/4/2021) .

                                                initial symptoms started at ~ 8-12 hr post inj on FRI:  fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain (generalized), back pain from sacrum to occiput, through cranium to behind eyes, nausea, loose stools, exhaustion, arm swelling (6&#34; diameter) with bandaid indented becoming hard (feeling a little like cellulitis).  routinely measure pO2 and body temp--both spiked; resp rate went from normal pattern of 10-12 to 25; night time HR went from low 60&#39;s to the 100&#39;s; pO2 went from 96-98 to 89-91 (Innovo PulseOx)Treated with sleep (slept from 8PM night of shot until 48 hours after the shot), fluids, hot water bottles, arnica (I can&#39;t take NSAIDS), vit C, zinc megadoses;  by ~36 hours post injection I started wheezing and coughing deeply but non productive, both nasal passages were/are open, feels as though phlegm is stuck at bronchi.  By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

At no time did I have difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing or any other anaphylaxis symptoms other than the ones described.

                                                After receiving my shot on Friday, my arm began to get sore, my ears felt like they were on fire.  I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

Felt swollen, but dont think it was, burning sensation on lateral borders and tip of tongue,extremely dry mouth.  Felt as though it had also been burned, and had a few white spots on tip, reddened borders on lateral aspects also, very scallopededges. Note I do have a fissured tongue but this reaction was unlike any I had ever had from eating certain foods that trigger any tongue response, and had not eaten anything night before to trigger this. Lasted a few days and progressively felt normal after 3-4 days.

I returned to the vaccination distribution site - EMT&#39;s checked my O2, pulse and blood pressure which were all normal.  They check my blood sugar which was at 40.  I had eaten about 90 minutes before (egg, toast, coffee).  They administered glucose and rechecked 10 minutes later.  I was at 41.  I was oriented and by then the numbness and dizziness had subsided and has completely resolved. I experienced flu-like symptoms beginning in the evening of 1/22 and continuing consisting of tiredness, body aches, runny nose, sneezing, cough, stomach rumblings and diarrhea (mainly on 1/24).

                                                Tingling sensation in my lips and the tip of my tongue about 20 minutes after I got the vaccine.  I was given a dose of 25 mg of benedryl and asked to remain in the observation area for an hour.  The tingling stopped within the hour and I went home.  I was fine the rest of the day but experienced fatigue and a sore throat on Days 2 and 3 after vaccination.  I was told to get a COVID test and it came back negative.  I am fine now.  I will get my second dose on Feb 13th.

                                                I was woken up from sleep at 11:30 with swelling of my tongue.  It was getting hard to breath, so I got ice and sucked on it for awhile, then I put a cold cloth on my face, tried to relax and the swelling seemed ok.  I stayed up all night because I was afraid that it would get worse, At about 9:30a.m. it seemed to be getting back to normal with just a little swelling in the back of my tongue.  I felt terrible for the next three days and still don&#39;t feel great. Sore joints, got chills, headache.  I am not going in for the second shot.

                                                All three reactions were the same. I woke up feeling like my throat had a flap that was not allowing me to inhale. I had been snoring and work up abruptly because I couldn&#39;t breathe at that moment.  If I inhaled sharply or sniffed hard to try and clear my throat, my airway blocked. I had a fever and also swollen glands in my neck and under my jaw. Once I got out of bed, I drank a glass of cold water and walked outside in the cold. I felt like it was an allergic reaction; so I took a Benadryl and I tried to go back to bed, but when I laid down it seemed worse, so I spent the night in my recliner. The first reaction was the worst in severity and happened about two weeks after my first injection. The second reaction was less than two weeks later,  the last one happened 4 days after my second injection. All three incidents lasted about 12 hours, but I still feel like my glands are a bit swollen, and I have a hesitation when I swallow. I talked to my doctor today 3/1, he ordered a COVID test and ordered me to quarantine until I get the results.

It has remained elevated and very loud since my vaccination. (much louder than before my vaccination) . Before I barely heard it during the day, but mostly at night, but post-vaccine, I hear it all the time.  There is no treatment for tinnitus except to continue my daily dosage of Triamterene.  I will address it with my Dr. at my next appointment in April. I hope the outcome will be that my tinnitus returns to levels prior to the vaccine.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min. Within 5 mins, heat rose up to my head causing dizziness &amp; head spin. Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

                                                Hello, i took the Moderna 1/4 and am scheduled for 2nd shot 2/1. I just wanted to pass on some side effects and i did not go on the agency website which i should have to report them. I had a headache off and on the first week. the first day afterward i had a 100 degree fever as well. I never have sleep issues (falling asleep etc) i had insomnia and could not sleep and didnt sleep well for around a week. What i noticed most though is it really affected my stomach and i was awakened with acid reflux several times. the muscles of my stomach were sore like i had been coughing (but hadn&#39;t) and i had no desire for food, only fruit, light watery things. as soon as i eat anything i have stomach pain digesting. Since last weekend i sleep way too much, even if i set the alarm i turn it off and keep sleeping. I try to walk and get out.  when i wake up it seems my stomach has been really active, i have a horrible taste in my mouth and acid reflux liquid in my through.  Just letting you know; and I have the 2nd shot so fingers crossed i&#39;ll come through all of this. Take care as well. Thanks

                                                Adverse event: Face swelling especially the eyes (eye lids, tissue between nose and eyes and below eyes), lips and outside the lips (left upper lip and into cheek and lower right lip into chin). Note: I was not having any trouble breathing and I did not think my throat was closing up.  Treatment: Benadryl 50 mg immediately and again 4 hours later,  Allegra 180mg once daily for 7-10 days, Methylprednisolone 4mg Dospak 21S, Famotidine 20mg 1 twice/day for 10 days. Outcome: Spoke to MD about 8PM on 1/19/21; took first dose of Benadryl and Allegra about 8:20PM; MD called in other Rxs and I had to pick them up, so first doses of methylprednisolone and famotidine were taken around 9:05PM; around 10PM or a bit after MD checked on me and I said I thought the lip swelling was improving but it was hard to tell with the eyes; MD had previously instructed me to stay up to 12:30PM in order to take the second dose of Benadryl 50mg, which I did and then I went to bed. In the morning around 9AM, I thought the face swelling had gone down 40-50%. MD called me around 9:16AM and I reported to her that the swelling had gone down 40-50%.  At 10:36PM tonight as I make this report, my swelling as gone down more maybe by an additional 10 or 15%.

Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

I didnt have a fever but the chills went on for several hrs so I took 2 500mg tylenol and the chills ended around 5pm.  I developed a headache and still had to continue to drink plenty water because my mouth got that super dry feeling again.  I went home ate and relaxed until I fell asleep.  I had body aches and because my arm was hurting I couldnt lay on that side.  I took benedryl and tylenol before bed. Today I still feel very very tired, fatigued and my body still aches.  My arm is still really red, warm to the touch and has a nice knot at the injection site and the headache comes and goes.

                                                I received my shot on Friday Jan. 22,2021. Other than a sore arm no other symptoms until Monday morning at 10:30 when suddenly I had a very sore throat. As time passed it got worse and I had trouble swallowing and speaking but not breathing. I work for a dentist and he looked at my throat and my uvula and soft palate were very swollen and red. He referred me to my primary physician who saw me late that afternoon.  I had no other symptoms except pressure in my ears. My doctor gave me a steroid injection and put me on prednisone for 5 days and amoxicillin 500mg, 1 gram twice a day. About 3 hours later the swelling had gone down enough for me to eat some and talk better. By the next day things were much better. I really don?t know if this was a reaction to the vaccine or not but many people have told me to report it. My doctor wasn?t sure if it was that or a bacterial infection. He treated me for both to get the swelling down.

Later sometime in the middle of the night, I wasn&#39;t able to fall asleep as if I&#39;d had a stimulant, and had intense arm pain where shot given, some nausea, some intestinal discomfort, intense pain at temples and behind eyes, overall &#34;crappy&#34; feeling.  Sun., Feb 14, 3rd day after shot: Pains/symptoms same as above with the addition of a low grade fever (99.9), chills, fatigue, no appetite. Tylenol didn&#39;t help. Was able to drift in and out of light sleep. Later in the day, fever and majority of symptoms suddenly &#34;left&#34;,  gradually decreasing until I felt fine again by Sunday evening. No issues Monday, Feb. 15.

The following 24 hours I experienced total insomnia, chills, headache, body ache, shoot pains, extreme weakness, and nausea.  Insomnia lasted 3 nights.  The other side effects began to decrease after 24 hours, but still prominent enough to prevent from actively engage in anything for another 24 hours.  After the third night of insomnia, I thought I had turned the corner.  But I continued to experience headache (I basically never have headache), occasional nights of insomnia (I usually sleep extremely well), and low level of nausea, and fatigue.  Today, 8 days after the shot, after another night of difficulty in sleeping, I woke up with the same headache behind my right eye, nausea, weakness, and fatigue.  This is when I thought to report these side effects.

                                                Twenty minutes after receiving the vaccine I noticed my ears began to feel odd as I was driving home.  Within the hour after the vaccine I had significant tinnitus in both ears and felt pressure/discomfort in both ears and had trouble hearing at normal volume.  I expected this to be temporary and was not initially concerned.  About 90 minutes after the injection I developed a strong headache.  It lasted several hours and then was intermittent but ended at about 24 hours.  The morning after the vaccination I was surprised to still have tinnitus upon waking, along with pressure that at times was painful.  I also realized that I was having even more trouble hearing.  For example I had to turn my car radio, my television, and my other electronic devices up several levels and had a hard time understanding conversations in person.  It has now been 19 days and the ear symptoms have continued.

And eyes started feeling puffy especially my left one but when I looked in the mirror nothing was swollen.  About 30 minutes later I took a Benadryl.   It started feeling better but the sensation took about 24 hours to go away totally on my face and a few hours later for my eyes to feel normal.

This continued throughout the evening and night but not as intense as when it first began.  I awoke at 1:00 AM to a very intense sneezing and eye tearing, but on only the left side of my face and eventually both sides.  I took Allegra D and did get relief.  The sneezing (allergic rhinitis) reaction continued but after almost an hour of taking the Allegra D , it was not as intense.  My face also appeared swollen but only with respect of atypical allergic rhinitis intense reaction.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

                                                I felt anxious after the shot, but that night felt ok. Morning was another story. I woke up with pain in my muscles from the waist down and found it difficult to walk. My eyes started to hurt. I had blurred vision. Around 2:00 I went by the mirror and saw that my eyes were blood red. I laid down and rested. About 2 hours later I got up the most of the redness was gone but then I had a headache.  The next  morning a persistent cough and the sneezes started.  The headache would return every time that I coughed or sneezed. It was very painful- as if someone hit me with a hammer.  Even though the pain only lasted a few minutes, it hurt a lot. I sneezed and cough a lot. Finally, Sunday morning I was walking better; however, I felt I had the flu. Normally, I would have gone in and got ready for a sub, but I wasn&#39;t able to. I rested on the couch. Then took a 2 hour nap. Finally, I felt better around 6 pm except for the painful headache that returned every time I coughed or sneezed. It has been a week. I thought the worse would be over by now. I guess I will have to go in and talk to my doctor on Monday because the sneezes and coughs are still quite painful. When will it end?

                                                First I had a burning feeling on my face which began in the afternoon. By bedtime I was hurting all over, terrible headache and could not sleep. I developed a rash, pain, swelling and heat over injection area that was about 6 inches round. I also began to have ringing in my right ear and pain in the right side of my head. All of the symptoms persisted for over 48 hours and as of now four days later I remain with severe ringing in my right ear.

                                                Vaccinated at 1:20 PM on 1/26/2021. Approximately 15 min later I was in the waiting area, the nurse had been pre-notified to watch me for allergic reaction . In 15 minutes my symptoms were fast heart rate, lips burning, dark red facial flushing, ears flushing, and anterior neck flush, body tremors, a rapid response team notified to evaluate me. I was administered a 25 mg  Benadryl tablet per mouth.  I felt stabilized and chose to go to the ER within the building for further evaluation.  Remaining stabilized, had a 4 hour wait until I was seen by emergency staff. My treatment was Solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25 mg po. I was placed on a heart monitor and a pulse oximeter to check my oxygen levels the entire time I was in the ER. 4 hours prior to being seen by the ER doctors I had a CBC, a BMP blood work, and an EKG. After medications were administered I was observed approximately 1.5-2 hours. I was discharged with a 5 day medicine regimen to follow. Prednisone 40 mg per day; Pepcid 40 mg per day; Benadryl 25 mg every 6 hours. On 1/27 I chose to take the Benadryl 25 mg only because I had received the Pepcid and Prednisone the previous night late. On the 28th I took the medicine as prescribed but only took Benadryl every 12 hours. I felt Benadryl 4 times a day would not be handled well with my body. On 1/30 I was able to take the Pepcid and Prednisone but had to discontinue the Benadryl due to waking up with a spinning sensation upon opening eyes and a loss of equilibrium upon walking. I completed my medicine regimen on 2/1. Today 2/2 I woke up with symptoms of watery eyes, flushed face, mild facial itching, after drinking one cup of full caffeine coffee developed an increased heart rate and nervousness, was medicated with Benadryl 25 mg po at 10:00 AM along with my blood pressure medicine and potassium. Also at that time my blood pressure was 150/80. Three hours later my blood pressure had come down to 130s/60s but felt extreme weakness and felt the need to lay down and rest with legs elevated.  I continue with my day with increased heart rate with activity, so I have remained inactive for the rest of the day.   Also on 6:00 AM on 1/27 I was awakened with a heart rate In the 160s, I called 911, paramedics came 5 minutes later. On arrival my heart rate had instantly went down to the  112-120 range. The paramedics explained they have been treating COVID patients and have seen this a lot, we discussed going to the hospital but I felt I was stabilized and didn&#39;t need further treatment.   Also upon discharge from ER visit they had me get 2 epi-pens and I now have 2 epi-pens available at home.

                                                1) The right portion of my lower lip started to swell on Tuesday (Feb2) or Wednesday (Feb3); I don?t remember which day. It?s been getting a little worse every day, including today (Friday). I?ve been regularly putting petroleum jelly on my right, lower lip to relieve the discomfort. I?ve also been putting petroleum jelly all over my lower and upper lips, because both lips have become unusually dry since the swelling began.  2A) Part of my skin (near the needle?s point of entry on my arm) came off when I removed band-aid at end of my shower on Tuesday (Feb2) morning.  The narrow, skin-missing area on my arm is a little less than the size in length of the width of the band-aid that I removed. (I have a photo if you?d like to see it.) Although I turned shower water off before removing the band-aid, that raw skinless part of my arm started to sting and burn profusely, immediately after I removed band-aid. The steam (not water) from the shower stall is what burned so badly. When looking in mirror to investigate source of pain, I was puzzled as to why my skin was missing.   2B)Wednesday (Feb3) morning, my husband attempted to put Neosporin on that small portion of my skinless arm to prevent infection from setting in. But it was so painful, I had to stop him. The area burned for more than an hour. So now I keep the band-aid on that spot and don?t remove it. It?s still very sensitive, and I feel discomfort while taking a shower. But since I leave band-aid on, it doesn?t burn and sting like before. And It wasn?t until Thursday (Feb4), after looking online at missing skin, that I realized that my skin apparently came off when I removed the bandage. I also read, when looking online, that skin removal with bandages can happen more often with older folks like myself. I?m not sure if this is an adverse reaction to the vaccine or not but thought I?d report it just in case.

It started getting better after about 30 minutes. However, the left side near my jaw felt numb through the evening and my tongue was still tingly feeling. Today (the day after the vaccine) my tongue feels more like a burn. Worried about taking the 2nd dose after such a strange feeling  from this first dose.

This was  accompanied by a prickling sensations.  I got a sore inside my right nostril and a cold sore on right upper lip.  The mottling and vein prominence continue intermittently still.  Improving but not resolved entirely. Along with this, my eyes became intermittently  itchy as if I had an allergic irritation. This has also completely resolved.  I spoke with a relative who is a physician  and he felt that I may have had a hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis reaction.

It was a slight reaction, with no medical emergency and no lasting effects, but it was definitely an allergic reaction. My primary care physician, Dr  has advised me to not get the second dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Nearly  continuous headache behind the eyes since the evening of vaccine shot (11 days as of current date). Sometimes dull throb, sometimes sharp pain usually on left side (same side as vaccine shot). Sensitivity to light. When pain is sharper causes indigestion and nausea. Pain goes away if I take  ibuprofen, but always returns and persists overnight. I don&#39;t like taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen more than once a day or for continuous days. Acupuncture worked for a short time. Affects my ability to concentrate and work on computer or watch TV. What other natural treatment will help? How much longer will this last?

I didn&#39;t vomit, although I felt the slight urge.   I slept during the day and it helped.  The next day I was  fine. I thought the medicine was strong. This happened two weeks after the 1st dose.  I&#39;m waiting for the 2nd dose in two weeks, and I&#39;m thinking, is it safe to take after this happened?

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included two time cancer survivor . Concomitant medications reported included Carvedilol for high blood pressure, acetamide for cholesterol, potassium, multivitamins, zinc, calcium, Vitamin D.  On 05 Feb,  prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 031L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Patient was ok at midnight, but when they woke up, they felt very dizzy, were vomiting that day, and experienced extreme tiredness for 3 weeks, now they feel relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired, probably related to not been able to eat on account of having very limited appetite. They mentioned they had limited bowel function, and their bladder felt full, like they could not empty it. Patient states they had a dry mouth from  the beginning of the symptoms.  After a week of these symptoms, on Saturday, the patient went to a clinic and they did some bloodwork and found that the liver enzymes were elevated and 5 more values were not normal and that their kidney function was not normal.  They consulted with their oncologist and they believed these could be an extreme immune response to the vaccine, since the lab work conducted on the 23Dec2020 was normal.  Last Friday they have some blood tests and the values were back to normal.  Treatment for the events included paracetamol and ibuprofen alternating; and  Prednisone.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, dizziness, vomiting, fatigue, dry mouth were relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired.  The outcome events,  urinary retention,  decreased appetite,   and limited bowel function are unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I went to ENT doctor on 3/10/21 and was prescribed prednisone for 2weeks. That steroid had very little effect. I am able to function only if I take over the counter motion sickness pills every day. The tinnitus has not diminished but the dizziness is at manageable levels.

                                                I noticed tinnitus approximately 1 week after the first shot. It was initially soft but became more noticeable as the weeks progressed. After the 2nd vaccine, it became more pronounced. It is bilateral, pulsatile. Initially I did not associate it with the vaccine and I am not sure if it is coincidental. Are there other reported cases?

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  For the first 8 days, I experienced no reaction to the vaccine.  On day 9, I developed a rash on my right arm surrounding the vaccination  site. I was also flushed and my eyes were red.  And, I experienced diarrhea.  I began taking Benadryl 25mg  every 4 hours during the day (and took zolpidem only at night). In the subsequent 4 days, In addition to the rash, I experienced minor headaches and body aches (not unusual with my Fibromyalgia) so I added Tylenol 500 mg every 6 hours. The rash remained the same. Today is Day 5 and I awoke feeling better and the rash is the same size but not as vibrant. I used a cortisone cream on the rash today and only took Benadryl once when I began to feel lousy at the end of my work day.

Friday continued to feel the same sickness, nauseated, headache, off and on low grade temp and pain  in arms and upper back. I was taking 800mg Ibuprofen 3 times a day and it would ease off headache a little, but nothing  would stop for long.  I was just miserable. had heard the 2nd vaccine could cause such problems, but not the first...therefore, I am a little frightened of getting the 2nd vax. I tried to call the triage nurse at the VA to  ask her about it, but never could get thru to her.  Sent message saturday night to PCP, and was told to go to this website and put in info.

                                                Injection site pain a few hours following injection. About 7 hours after injection started feeling body aches and every bone in my body hurt. Teeth too. Felt like I had a sinus infection. Head and eye ached. Bad headache the next am. Took Tylenol at 10 am and felt better. Nothing more after that.  Just tested the remainder of the day.

                                                I woke up the next morning with numbness in my right forehead which later progressed to mild numbness in my right face. Later in the day, the soreness in my head worsened and extended back from my forehead to top of scalp on right side. I had ear pain which made it difficult to drink liquids as it caused more pain.  This morning, I do not have the ear pain. Still have mild numbness on the right side of my face and the scalp soreness is still there, but less. No facial or mouth drooping at all. Said in next statement that I have not recovered yet since I still have the numbness, although rather mild.

                                                When I first got the vaccine I was fine but as the day went on I felt soreness in my left arm with some stiffness in my neck. Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

We gave her ice for the back of her neck.  We checked her blood pressure, it was 230/130, pulse was within normal limits.  Pulse ox was low.  An ambulance was called.  She removed her mask and stepped back so that she could breath better and her oxygen and coloring improved.  She said that her lips felt numb, so we gave her some benadryl just in case.  We did not give an epi pen due to her increased blood pressure.  Her blood pressure did start improving but was still high when the ambulance came.  They took her to the ER for evaluation and she will be following up with her pcp also.  The hospital felt that it was just a fainting episode.

                                                The day following the vaccine I was fine until approximately 1:30 p.m. when I suddenly got very, very dizzy, had disequilibrium and began to feel nauseous, and had diarrhea.  The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

I also had a feeling of swelling in my upper lip. No obvious visual swelling, just sensation of fullness. I have a history of angioedema, but this has been a long time ago. I just stayed at site for @ 30 minutes. Sensations stayed for more than 1 hour. I took a antihistamine when I got home. This helped and it dissipated.

On the same day, I began to have difficulty with my vision , especially in the left eye, a headache and all my joints began to ache. I was also very tired. The symptoms progressively got worse  over the following two weeks and included a couple of episodes of heart rhythm irregularities . During the third week, the headache, eye issues and joint pain began to resolve but the tinnitus is debilitating and prevents me from mentally focusing or sleeping.

                                                Vaccine 3/4/21. 2nd day extreme tiredness for 2 days; then weak, dizzyish, tremors, blurred vision right eye which is near legally blind, poor concentration, generally poor feeling.  These symptoms went on for 2 weeks, until I had to do my routine lithium level on 3/18/21.  I was toxic at 1.7.  Have been on lithium 40 years and have never been toxic.  My doctor sent me to ER, where they gave me fluids and potassium.  When checked in ER, my BP was 214/87.  I never have high BP - 120/80 is normal.  On discharge, my BP was 194/79.  Saw my doctor ASAP on advice of ER.  My doctor put me on amlodipine for BP which I started today.  He said I had essential hypertension and heart rate is irregular.

The tinnitus has persisted and is intermittent but occurs daily for long periods.  I also have experienced a noticeable hearing loss.  I have difficulty hearing  what people are saying and all sounds are muffled.  I did not have this problem or the tinnitus prior to receiving the vaccine.

                                                On Feb 15th, I started getting very dizzy and couldn&#39;t hear out of my left ear. with extreme ringing and cricket sounds. The dizziness got so bad, my husband and daughter called 911 early Feb 16th to have an ambulance take me to the hospital. There, they took a cat scan of my head, and I was released that afternoon with Meniere, Tinnitus and Vertigo. I have a follow up ENT appointment with a Specialist on May 19th.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

It hurt to roll over in bed.  I lost my taste and smell. It lasted approximately 24 hours.  I had Covid in June, 2020 and had all of the exact symptoms, 100 times worse than when I had Covid.  9 days later, I had fever above 102 again, chills, shaking for approximately 6 hours again.  Is this a normal reaction?

She was noted to have significant nongranulomatous anterior chamber reaction (2&#43; cell). There was no hypopyon or keratic precipitates. She was symptomatic with pain and light sensitivity in the right eye only. (Of note, the left eye was quiet. It had undergone cataract surgery and recently discontinued postoperative steroid drops). I discontinued the Tobradex and start Durezol drops every 2 hours. Of note, she has no history of uveitis. I saw her again 1/12/21 with complete resolution of the inflammation. She is currently tapering down on the topical steroid. I will see her again on 1/26/21 while taking Durezol 1x/day. This should be about 3 days from her second vaccination

By abour 6:30 swelling was increasing, Visited facility and Urgent Care where I was given Dexamethasone 10 mg injection IM. Prescribed Predisone 20 mg tablet x2 daily for 5 days. Most swelling resolved by Saturday morning, but slight swelling is presisting so far.

                                                Became light headed within approx 5 min. It got worse and walking to observation room felt faint. Pulse rate elevated but attendant said not &#34;critically high.&#34; Breathing was normal. After about 20 minutes I started feeling better. Oddly, while sitting in observation room, my sinuses cleared up, and I detected an odd taste at the back of my throat. Developed  frontal headache about same time; took acetaminophen and it went away after 12 hours.

                                                about 7 hours after injection, the site was sore and tingling. Throughput the evening, the tingling sensation progressed up the left side of my neck and my ear.  My ear felt similar s to Novacaine wearing off after a dental visit. During the night my throat got a similar sensation and created the need to try coughing it out. By 24 hours after the injection I was tired, with sore joints and muscle aches. By 36 hours I was still sleeping it off and at 48 hours I feel pretty well back to normal.

Had some tingling in lips and tightness in chest, felt light-headed.  Paramedics observed and checked vitals.  Pulse ox was good, chest clear, BP high.  Gave me choice of getting IV or going to drugstore and purchasing benedryl to begin immediately.  Started oral benedryl.  Went home and took 2nd dose.  Redness is subsiding, BP reduced. Still mild light headedness.

I then went outside and in 10 minutes my lips began to tingle and become numb.  In several more minutes the left size of my lips were very numb and the right size somewhat numb.  In just.a couple of more. minutes the location under my entire left jaw became somewhat numb and then I felt like I had something small in. my throat.  I asked  my husband to look at my face to notice and swelling, drooping, or was I slurring my words.  He said no.     I could breath and swallow ok so I sat in the car in case I got worst and needed to go back inside the health department.   I waited outside for one hour and 15 minutes (until 5;00) and during that time I improved significantly.    The next day a area under my left eye switched several times. Then 10 days later I had pain in my left eye and for the next two days my eye was sore.    I need help in knowing if I should take the next shot or can I wait for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and take it.

                                                On the way home from vaccination (1/29/21), felt like something stuck in her throat but resolved within hours. One week later (2/5), woke around 2am with same feeling, but at time of report (10:0am, 2/5), she has taken Allegra and using throat lozenge and feels throat symptoms are improving. She reports that she does battle environmental/seasonal allergies, has been experiencing post nasal drip and some intermittent itchy eyes and scalp this week so this could be related to allergies. She also c/o red &#34;rash&#34; at injection site about the size of 50 cent piece which she first noted today - denies pain or swelling.  Writer advised she continue daily allergy medicine, consider using Benadryl as directed on the day of 2nd vaccination, and at any time between now and following administration of 2nd vaccine, if she should have worsening symptoms to seek care immediately. Also recommended 30 minutes observation period following 2nd vaccine - due 28 days from 1/29/21. She verbalized agreement with all.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the shot, my upper lip started tingling. Then both upper and lower lips were tingling. I could drink ok, so no problem swallowing. They took my blood pressure at the time and it was 104/55. I have low blood pressure but that was lower than normal. I stayed for 30 minutes and the tingling would come and go. They did offer to call an ambulance but I declined. I got up this morning and have 2 welts on my forehead and the left side of my lips are still tingling, and occasionally the right side. I will call my doctor tomorrow morning.

Mid-day, the right side of my tongue became numb.  But not so numb that I could not eat or drink. By evening I started feeling prickly sensation as one does when novacaine is wearing off. Slept throughout the night. Woke on Saturday, February 27, 2021 with less numbness and prickly sensations. Sunday, February 28, 2021, slight numbness near eye, nose and mouth.  I had Bells Palsy in June 2000.

Called 911 on way home. EMTs said allergic reaction. Oxygen sat was 97 percent. They said to go to ER if symptoms continued. Went to ER, where I received injections of Benadryl and steroids. Released after a period of observation. Today I am still flushed and tired from vaccine but am otherwise okay.

                                                RN was staffing a Covid clinic at HS. One of our other nurses gave her the 1st Moderna vaccine at 1:45 PM on 2/12/21. At 1:55 PM, the nurse who had given her shot noticed that patient was pale, and said she was not feeling well. Her BP was 179/110, and she said she usually has low BP. She c/o of &#34;feeling hot and was having difficulty breathing.&#34; She was seen by our medical director. After 30 minutes, her BP was 120/82. She said she ?felt a little better and called her sister to pick her up.? Later that evening, patient texted me saying I didn?t feel well when I got home, had trouble focusing literally and had a crying jag and felt shaky on the inside. I kept hydrating, took 25 of Benadryl and slept for 2 hrs., now feel close to normal. It was definitely a reaction to the shot-just weird!? Patient texted me on 2/13/21 that ?the FDA thinks one vaccine may be enough for 80?90% effectiveness, so I might not get the 2nd dose? On 2/15/21 patient texted, ?My PCP thinks what I had was a side effect &amp; recommends taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Tylenol before the 2nd injection, and doesn?t seem to be worried about it!?   On 2/19/21, I received a text from patient at 5:28 AM as she was scheduled to staff a Covid clinic that day, beginning at 7:30 AM. She said, ?I have been up for a couple hrs w/severe eye pain and can?t hardly open my eye but it hurts to close it too! At 10:37 AM she texted, ?I just got home from eye doctor and was prescribed drops 4X/day. Apparently, there are pin holes in my sclera &amp; cornea which hurt so bad I had lavender cold pack on all day &amp; couldn?t stand the light. It is a corneal abrasion &amp; I have no idea why that would happen suddenly?. The following day, she texted me a picture of her L arm injection site which she said was ?very itchy and hot! Not painful-? It was about 6 inches in diameter, red, inflamed,  delayed cutaneous rx.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:30AM. Around 4:00PM that day I started having severe dizziness. About 40 minutes later I had severe pain in my neck, back, and shoulders. I have had 3 herniated discs in the past and the pain from this was much worse than that pain.  About the same time I felt a headache coming on that just got worse as the night went on. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep, however, the pain was so great that I could not lay down flat or sit up. I spent the night walking the floor. During the night I vomited several times. I also developed jaw pain, earaches, and a sore throat.  But the worse part was that during the night I started to feel the sensation of pins and needles being thrust into my legs, ankles, arms, and hands. I never did however have a fever. I finally was able to fall asleep at about 5AM and slept for several hours. When I woke up the pain was mostly gone and I was just left with no energy at all so that I could hardly lift my head off the pillow. I stayed in bed the entire day and the next day I was fine.

                                                Post vaccine 2/9/21, I experienced drop in O2 Sat over a period of several weeks as I log my daily vitals (blood sugar, BP, Temp, Pulse rate and O2 Sat in percent).  I have O2 concentrator that I use as needed via nasal cannula.  I do have SOB with exertion due to Sarcoidosis of the Lung.  I notified my PCP on 2/19 of a morning sat of 89 which came up with O2 and breathing exercises, I also took a 20mg. Lasix and Mucinex chewable which usually helps with congestion.  With O2 and rest, my O2 Sat improved and extra O2 was stopped.  Then again my O2 steadily dropped over a period of a week, I coughed more (always have come cough), SOB. On March 7th, getting ready for bed, I became severely SOB, O2 Sat now 82, I called 911.  Was alert, oriented when Paramedics arrived, but needed 100% O2 and transported to Hospital, SOB was severe, gasping/drowning, loss of awareness, apparently resp. arrested, was intubated.  STAT CT with Contrast, and Echocardiogram, R/O PE, Lung collapse, etc.  (No PE/or collapse). MY supposition is that I had a slow moving allergic response to Moderna Vaccine (I am a former healthcare worker of 20 years) and currently work in healthcare medical devices in Ultrasound.  I closely watch vaccine development and read research articles on Sarcoidosis, vaccines and COVID. I participated and continue with a Sarcoidosis Study). I think I experienced cytokine storm with my ultrasensitive immune system. I use oral steroid (QVAR 40mics inhaled daily) which I doubled after taking the vaccine for a few weeks. I have had a MMR vaccine last June 2020 and Quadvalent Flu vaccine last August 2020.

                                                Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss in left ear. Symptoms began Friday evening Jan. 8, 2021. Sounded like muffled sound in my ear, water running, ringing. Then on Saturday Jan.9, 2021 my left ear felt like it had to pop and I felt my hearing was impaired.  By Sunday evening Jan. 10, 2021, I could barely hear out of my left ear. I called MD immediately Monday morning, Jan. 11, 2021 and was seen that afternoon. I was examined and had a hearing test. I was diagnosed with SSHL and started treatment of a series of steroid injections directly into my eardrum to save my hearing immediately. I have had 2 injections and hearing test since then. The doctors feel this was a side effect of the COVID vaccine due to my compromised immune system, but not an allergic reaction, but a side effect. I had the same condition about 15 years ago from a virus.

                                                Fever, chills, body aches, tiredness, loss of taste, headache, redness and tenderness at site of injection approximately 3x1.5 inches oval shaped, some slight numbness in whole arm  Redness, tenderness, numbness began within a few hours of injection.  Flu-like symptoms began at about 30 hours post injection and continued for at least 10 hours at which point I slept.  All gone like magic the next morning, except for the redness and tenderness at the injection site, which continues as of this report, but is much less.  No treatment except rest and fluids.  I submit this report to help with your statistical analysis.

                                                Developed  extreme facial redness which was very warm to touch. Also lips were tingly and somewhat numb feeling. I felt very anxious which is not typical for me, I have had several other vaccines with no reaction in past. I had left the facility following 15 minutes of monitoring and took off my mask in the car. I looked in mirror because my face felt so warm. My husband was with me and symptoms did not worsen so we went home which only took 10 minutes and after another 30 minutes it did not subside so I took a low dose of liquid Benadryl. This eventually relieved my symptoms. I took another low dose at bedtime also. I slept through the night and had no further problem the next day. Thus  I did not contact a physician or the facility.

My huband checked my temperature and it was almost 101; so he gave me some tylenol. It did not help. Between 1 and 2 pm I became nauseous and started vomiting. My husband called the Dr&#39;s office but could not reach anyone nor was he able leave a message to report that I was sick and my temp was now 102.  I suffered through the night with tylenol and sips of water, gingerale and tea. On Saturday morning still having rather mild chills and low grade temp of 99.7 and feeling really tired but by evening I could eat soup and crackers which stayed down and drinking sprite,  ale and tea. Sunday,  still feeling tired but moving more and keeping fluids down. I noticed that I was hungry but food had no taste. Fever broke early Monday morning, still feeling sluggish but much improvement.

A few days after that my blood pressure was going lower than normal and I felt dizzy, so I reduced my blood pressure medication and kept an eye on it. I also had a huge a lump in my arm and my whole arm was sore. It was red and hot to the touch.

By the time that she looked in her rear view mirror her face was swelling up.   Her face started to burn, fast heart beat, and dizziness.  Her neck started to burn as well.  She looked at the side effects.  She called her doctor and took 2 Benadryl as she recommended, and took a nap.  Her doctor told her to continue taking the Benadryl and to call us to report the reaction.  She still has the swelling and the burning sensation in her face, and is still getting a little dizzy but it comes and goes.  The fast heartbeat comes and goes as well.

We gave her a bottle of water to drink and crackers and she said she felt better. The tongue tingling went away as well before the 30 minutes ended. Her blood pressure was retaken before she left and it remained in the 140s/100s. She said this is higher than her normal but it could be due to anxiety.

Remain isolated from others due to age- so it?s hard to believe it?s a cold bc of lack of exposure to others.

Nurse took BP reading of 148/93 (high). Gave me a bottled water to drink. Tongue began to feel tingly. Repeated BP at 10:30am 160/109. Arm was tense and could have been a false read.  Repeated BP at 10:35am 140/111.  I became chilled and shaky and asked for crackers since I hadn?t eaten that morning.  Was given  and ate 6 small peanut butter crackers and felt a little better. At 10:57am I left Meijer with a BP reading of 144/107. Went home, ate breakfast of scrambled eggs and toast.  Laid down and rested  most of the day. BP at 6pm 139/90.

                                                First two days after vaccine- tired. By day three began experiencing back pain. By Wednesday, January 20th severe back pain and chest tightening. I went first to Urgent Care. Dr. said EKG ok but I should follow up with Dr. or ER. That evening I went to ER at Hospital. By then it felt like my back and chest were in vice. It did not feel like regular back pain- more searing and deep spasms. Had a gnawing kind of feeling in my stomach and esophagus. Pain in upper part of my body....sometimes waves of pain in shoulders and down back half of my arms. ER Dr gave me shot of pain meds and sent me home after a few hours. Vice like feeling subsided but deep muscle pain in back continued.It was not as severe as the previous day. Over the next week it continued to go from severe back to mild.I visited my primary care Dr/PA and tried changing GERD meds from Famotidine to another- no help. Tried muscle relaxers- I just slept on those. About a week after first visit I went to ER again after a bad night of the vice like feeling in chest and back. ER Dr. did CAT scan of heart and lungs. No sign of pneumonia . Since then I have had an endoscope, seen a cardiologist, and an orthopedic Dr.  After second dose, reaction came back, but less severe than the first time.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

She tells me she has &#34;a heart condition&#34; and is followed by a cardiologist. She tells me she was in her usual state of health and took her COVID-19 first vaccine today.  Approximately 30 seconds later she noted chest tightness/burning that has been constant.  It is rated 9/10 at maximum and improved to 5/10 after about 10 to 15 minutes.  She also states, &#34;my eyes feel funny.  I feel cold.  I am dizzy.&#34; She endorses palpitations and dyspnea. She denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, diaphoresis, headache, cough, rash, or syncope. She does have a history of seafood allergies and had similar reactions after eating seafood. She tells me 3 years ago after a flu shot she fainted.  She tells me the past 2 years after her flu shot she had nausea or vomiting. She tells me she fell yesterday and hurt her hip but she did not hit her head.  No LOC. She tells me she takes baby aspirin nightly. Family history: Mom and dad both died at age 82 from lung cancer.  They both had heart disease.   She was sent back from the vaccination area to urgent care to be evaluated after her reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA   Wednesday I had the vaccine.  Later I had thought I had bit my tongue but could not remember doing that.  Thursday - I still had the feeling of bitten my tongue.  Looking at my tongue to see the damage, no cut tissue but, there was ~ 3 bumps on the Left side of my tongue on the &#34;side&#34; of my tongue. Friday there were about 6.  Saturday they started to disappear there were 2.  By Sunday they were gone.  Do not know if this was from the vaccine but it was a strange thing to happen and the timing made me think there may be a connection.    I HAD MY SHOT IN MY LEFT ARM.   IT WAS MY 1ST SHOT.

My upper lip started swelling until big and swollen.  I could feel tingling in my face and itchiness and pain from the swelling.  I took Benadryl at home and went to sleep.  The next day, Thursday, my left lip had swollen over the night and my face also swelled, particularly on my left cheek.  It persisted throughout the day.  I continued with the Benadryl.  The net day I had an appointment with Dr., a dermatologist previously scheduled for something else.

The right side had more rash than the right, and both sides wrapped around to the back, about 2 inches, on both sides. Less going down the rest of the torso. Took Benadryl, 2-25 mg, 4 hours apart, for a total of 100 mg. 1:00PM, Feb. 26, rash faded significantly.  Also had a dry mouth and a bit of a racing heart, right after being given the vaccination &amp; again when the rashes appeared. However, this could have been anxiety. Both times it went away after walking &amp; deep breathing. Lasted for about 15 minutes each time.

                                                Began not feeling well about 8 hours after my shot. That night I developed a fever (under 100 degrees) and chills. Had some heart palpitations. Next day I still had a slight fever, general malaise, soreness from shot in arm, a few occurances of heart palpitations, sore back. On third day, no fever, but still felt under the weather, with a sore arm plus some hardness in the injection area. Had some palpitations that evening. By the 4th day, felt better in general, but began feeling a very slight numbness on lips and surrounding facial area. Arm still sore with hardness. Better on 5th day. Day 8 &amp; 9 had pains in lower shins. Day 9 I noticed tiny small bumps on upper front and back shoulders and upper arms. They were not hive like and some were itchy. Took some Benadryl that night which didn&#39;t reallly help. Days 10-12 - still have tiny bumps some slightly pink, mostly skin tone, spreading to neck area. Saw my internist on 2/25/21 Day 14 to ask if symptoms related to vaccine shot. He didn&#39;t think the rash was related because it didn&#39;t start away after shot. The continuing ever so slight numbness in lips and surrounding area may be just from anxiety, he said. 3/1/21 - still have occasional slight numbness off and on of lips with &#34;grainy&#34; rash still present.

                                                About one hour post inoculation my speech became jibberish. Cognitively, I could organize my thoughts and knew exactly what I wanted to express to my husband and our waitress, but when I opened my mouth to speak, only jibberish came out.  I couldn&#39;t say anything meaningful.  It lasted about 2&#43; hours and hasn&#39;t reoccured.   That night when I went to bed I was extrememly light sensitive.  We had the usual degree of light in our bedroom but with my eyes closed it felt like all the overhead lights in the room were on.  I had to block out the alarm clock, but that was the only adjustment that could be made.  Drapes were closed and no other lights of any kind were on.  That was bothersome for the first couple of nights. I&#39;m still having a difficult time falling asleep when I go to bed and staying asleep all night.  My &#34;fight or flight&#34; response is highly charged.

                                                Within an hour after injection, my face, around my mouth,  felt a tingling and slightly numb.  Inside of mouth felt strange.  I did not have trouble breathing or swallowing.  Symptoms gradually went away and later in the day I had a headache.

                                                Symptoms started on Saturday morning (1/16/2021)  following the shot having been administered the previous day (1/15/2021) at 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon.  Initially, I had a slight, constant  headache and &#34;medium&#34; fatigue.  I dismissed it as not important because it was relatively minor. and I am generally fatigued at the end of a work week.  The headache lasted all day but was fairly low level. I did not sleep well that night but was able to function during the next day (1/17/2021)  without a problem.  I don&#39;t remember if the headache was present that day.  However, on Sunday evening (1/17/2021) (around 6:00 p.m. or so) chills started to go up and down my body and my hands were very cold.  I had no fever.  I added more garments to keep warm and ignored or was distracted by my activities of the evening. Monday (1/18/2021) during the day the chills continued to go up and down my body  intermittently-- not really staying in one place -- but my hands remained very cold.  It should be stated that I prefer colder temperatures; i keep my house between 60-62 degrees in winter and I am able to stay comfortable with a shirt and sweater in that environment.  So, on Monday, the fact that I had chills was remarkable to me. The chills were intermittent. Tuesday (1/19/2021) I worked from home all day and had an electric heater going focused very closely on my body all day.  I was cold but don&#39;t remember having chills.  Tuesday evening the chills returned, along with a significant headache that circled my head (not focused in one spot), my body ached, my eyeballs ached; I had intestinal cramping .and I simply could not get warm due to the constant &#34;full-body&#34; chills. I went to bed with a heated mattress pad on,  flannel sheets, a comforter an d a thick wool  blanket. I could not get warm.  I was not able to sleep at all the entire night due mostly to the (major) physical discomfort and (minor) worry as to what was going on. I DID NOT have a fever. Around 8:30 on Wednesday morning, I was able to fall asleep as the chills had diminished and I was worn out. The body and eyeball aches were still present as was the intestinal cramping. Later that afternoon the symptoms started to diminish and I was able to sleep Wednesday night. I did not eat anything on Wednesday as I was not interested in food due to the discomfort of  the intestinal cramping. I was able to smell food and had not lost my sense of taste.  Thursday morning (1/21/2021,  I finally felt like I could eat and had  some food which tasted delicious to me.  I was able to get warm, had slight headache, cramping was mostly gone, ..I still had (reduced levels) body aches and eyeball aches.  I had no chills.  I was able to consume and tolerate reduced amounts of food.  Friday (1/22/2021) I was tired but able to function and felt as if I was returning to feeling like myself.  Today, Saturday(1/23/2021, I am feeling about 95% myself and relieved to have this behind me.  I am very concerned about how I might react to the second dose of the vaccine.  I am going to consult the local hospital and my PCP there to inquire about the advisability of getting the second dose.

                                                High fever with chills, aches all over body, especially in places an injury occurred anytime in my life. Injection arm tender &amp; sore to touch from elbow to shoulder &amp; was slightly red around the injection site.  It felt like my body had been cut up into pieces &amp; scotch taped back together with all the pain everywhere. Thirsty , mildly nauseated.  Thursday morning I ate 5 bites of cream of wheat made with water. I was mostly bedridden until Thursday 18th night; I was able to eat broth &amp; noodle soup.  Continued in bed most of the time, began eating solid food Fri., mashed potatoes, crackers &amp; vegetable salad. Still very tired. By Fri. 2/19/2021 I was beginning to regain my strength to more normal levels. I still needed 2 hour naps &amp; slept 9-10 hours nightly. Still seemed I&#39;d get a low fever, then break it for several days.  I started sleeping on the sore arm side, cuz it was so painful on the other side &amp; on my back after several days in bed. My arm stopped hurting after 5 days3/1/2021 Today is my best day yet.  Happy to have the vaccine, no regrets!!! Thank you so much for that.

The very first symptoms, about 4 hours after the vaccine was heavy thirst, neck ache, and loss of appetite. Besides the above symptoms, starting about 12 hours after vaccine, was severe nausea. Only able to drink water and some apple juice. Could not get out of bed the day after vaccine without getting chills, breaking out in cold sweat and nausea. This is now the second day since vaccine and I have no severe symptoms. I am only feeling weak.

                                                About 5 minutes after the injection, my throat began to feel tight like it was swelling. When it did not improve in about 5 more minutes, I took a benedryl, which l carry with me in my purse. When the time was up that l was supposed to wait (15 min.), l pulled out of line but did not leave the parking lot. I parked behind the EMS  on duty to wait a while longer to be sure the symptom improved rather than getting worse. EMS talked with me to be sure l was ok, and to check for a rash, which l did not have. After about 10 more minutes my throat had improved to the point where l felt like l was going to be ok &amp; could drive home. I did experience tingling around my mouth, tooth pain, &amp; a metallic taste in my mouth . My drs. Office suggested l report these symptoms to you.

                                                Had history of delayed reactions to allergy shots in past and staff administering vaccinations were concerned about whether that might possibly occur with the COVID vaccination. Many of the delay had been 48 to 72 hours.  I didn&#39;t feel like going to the Farmer&#39;s Market and by 2 pm started getting a migraine headache which had be concerned.   I had not had any fever but had had arm pain that I had used a heating pad for.  I ate Saturday.  I started noticing neck stiffness and some difficulty moving my head right and left.  I had migraine headaches from age 13 - 50 with an increase during pregnancy so I knew what they were and  what I had started to experience as the night went on into Sunday was more than I had ever  experienced in my life.  Flat on my back, ice, no intake, tylenol/codeine, nothing did anything and and the intensity kept coming.  I vomited some Sunday evening which usually helps release the pressure, but nothing helped.  I continued to have more difficulty turning my neck from side to side, visual difficulties and excruciating pain.  I had a virtual appointment with my endocrinologist and she was concerned about what was going on and gave me some guidelines lines about managing my blood sugars and suggesting that I be on the Farxiga if I went in the hospital.  I made it through another virtual meeting basically holding my head in my hands.  I canceled all my dental and doctor appointments because of the unrelenting pain and my concern for my driving. I began having some spastic jerking of the head and neck, which with the mask on forced my teeth into my front gums and lacerated the wholes front inside of my mouth. On 3/23 my husband died unexpectedly, I canceled Wednesday&#39;s Funeral Home visit because of my concern regarding driving and the extreme degree of pain.  I could barely move my neck past center.  I was also having mobility issues and my right side was working as well as it should.  Typing and writing were difficult.  My pain level was off the chart.  I had spoken with the doctor and once I did the required things at the funeral home, I took myself to the emergency room.  My pain was coming off the right lower part of my neck, affecting my vision, my appetite, my balance--basically neurologically going downhill on a fast slide since Saturday night. I told the nurse that my pain level was 20&#43;. The Spinal Tap in the ER was negative across the board and the fluid was clear.  IV&#39;s were hung to help with hydration.  Solumedrol and methacarbornol were given IV to deal with the inflammation around the vertebrae and the pain muscle spasms. Ice packs were applied to the front and pack of the neck to not only help with swelling, but with to relieve pain and help with neck alignment.  Blood sugars were a real struggle with all the prednisone on board but were helped some with the arrival of my Frixiga from home. It was the new Neurologist in the practice that looked at my posture, listened to my history and said, I am going to get some X-rays which took all day to do.  The X-rays showed that there had been swelling and shifting to make CI and C2 put pressure on the nerve. There was also a problem with L3.  A second neurologist added a morning dose of Topomax (50mg) which began to show some effect on Tuesday after being in the hospital for 5 days.  These 2 neurologist, along with the one in the ER could not rule out that what I experienced was a delayed reaction to the Moderna Vaccination, particularly as I have had delayed reactions to allergy shots in the past. It was suggested by the radiologist that a MRI be  one for a more definitive brain study as well as a spine study but the doctor on originally was doing much and didn&#39;t pick up on that. I have had to wean off of the prednisone at home which has meant wonderful monitoring of blood sugars. I have had to continue to wear the neck collar and slowly ween out of it.  I have been exhausted--the doctors think some of that may be from the muscle spasms and the fact that it took 4 days before there was a significant decrease in the intensity in the headache.  I still have to focus on posture and my right had gets very tired of the board.   Signatures are still not as  neat as they were but better than they were when I was admitted.

I felt not myself after reaching the lobby and sat a little while there. Once home took tylenol and rested for while woke with horrible headache including the next day.

                                                I spoke to my sister on the phone an hour or two after she got the vaccine and she was slurring her words.  The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

                                                Received the vaccine and about 5-7 minutes she felt like somebody put there thumb on the right side of her throat and pushed really hard.  This got worse and worse for about 10 minutes and stayed that way for about an hour.  She was kept for 45 minutes.  Later on it got less and less and by that evening the sensation was gone.  On day 29 2/20/21 of the vaccine she started having really crazy dizzy spells, off balance, blood pressure was going up and having the shakes.  She went to the ER 02/21/21, which they did a lot of testing, and everything was fine.  They did not know if it was due to the virus.  She saw her PCP today 2/24/21 and she said that it could be from the vaccine, but again not sure.  She called the health dept and told them that she was canceling her appointment and advised that she call us to report the incident.   She has also had pressure in her chest, generally overall not feeling well over the last 3 days.

                                                About 1 hour and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine I became dizzy.  3 1/5 hours later I developed chills which lastly briefly. The next day I had  huge area on my  left eye on my pupil which lasted for 5 days. I have blue eyes and right at toward the end of the blue I have white deposits.  On  2/24/2021 I went  see an eye doctor Dr. He diagnosed me with &#34;whiss&#34; ring around both of my eyes, and seen spot on my lenses on my left eye.  I started starburst with my left eye, this did not develop until after I received the vaccine.  I have a dot on my right eye now. On 02/26/2021 see another eye doctor Dr., he also said I have deposits around my cornea, acknowledged the starburst effect on the left eye, and noticed the &#34;whiss&#34; ring.  Since I took the vaccine my eyes have become very light sensitive.  The doctors have told me this conditions are permanent, if it gets worse they will have to scrape the eye and have a laser surgery.  I do  not remember when it started but it 2inches by 3 inches, red patch which started at the injection site and went diagonal.

March 7th right hand went numb again and had vision problems with right eye, cleared up in about 15 minutes.  March 9th right hand and right side of face went numb.  Went to hospital and was examined and told I was having a stroke.  I was admitted to hospital for two days.  MRI showed that I had a stroke and now have some brain tissue damage.  I and now going to occupational therapy to regain use of right hand.  The Doctors thought that it was pretty coincidental that my first stroke symptom (transient numb right hand on the 6th) started just a couple days after I got the second dose of the moderna vaccine.

Into the night I began vomiting (which lasted all night)  I became feverish, had chills with body shaking, extreme nausea. (temp 102) This persisted to the next day and I went to the ER.  There I was given  multiple liters of IV fluids,  IV Zofran and IV Tylenol.   I felt better after treatment but still had the intense headache and ringing in the ears.  The next day, I&#39;m now gradually beginning to feel better, just weak.  I can eat today, two days after the injection and slowly beginning to feel better.   This reaction was terrible for me.

I also had ringing in my ears. I felt like I was going to pass out. It scared me.  I put on my brakes and started to pull over but by the time I started to pull over, the dizziness was slowly starting to clear up.  I had a &#34;foggy&#34; feeling in my head for about a half hour after so I went to my friend&#39;s house and sat down and drank some water. Then I went home.  I have had no incidents since then.

The nurse advised her to take benadryl which she did and then the numbness went away. About 8 days post vaccination, patient reported a rash around the injection site area of her arm as well as ear canal itchiness on the left side. She has been taking allertec as advised by her doctor. The rash as subsided somewhat but the ear itchiness is still present. She said that it flares up off and on.

I have never had one but it appeared to be migrane.  Eyes felt the size of tennis balls and couldn&#39;t open eyes.  Could not stand any noise or any light.  Could not pick head up off pillow.  Constant swallowing like going to throw up.  Day #2 same thing.  Day #3 same thing but eyes felt like golf balls.  Eyes blood shot.  Day #4 (today) still some head ache and swollen eyes.  No energy.  Am scheduled for March 8 to have second shot.     WILL NOT.  Getting on plane on March 10 and will not take chance of this happening again.  Husband read that second shot has worse effects.  I sincerely feel like a &#34;lab rat&#34; since no one knows what happens to people after vaccines.  Would be really great if someone will contact me to explain reaction to shot.

                                                I wanted to report that the pharmacist that administered the vaccine gave my mother the 1st dose of the vaccine 2 times in under a minute while being distracted.  This was a horrifying and careless mistake.  My mother is experiencing a headache that has been intense for 48 hours now, a very large visible lump at the injection site along with a red rash.  She has had  dizziness and lightheadedness.  She also has ringing in her ears.  The main reason for filing this report is because of the error made and the concern of what other effects getting a double dose of the 1st shot will cause her.

                                                I was perfectly fine after the vaccine, except for a sore arm. On day 3 I noticed my tongue starting to swell and lips tingling. It got a little worse and I felt it moving towards my throat, and then it stopped. This only lasted maybe a couple of hours, and not more than three hours. I had not eaten anything since the day before, so knew it was not food related. I didn?t associate this reaction to the vaccine until I searched online, and found that tongue swelling and facial paralysis could be common. I was also tired that day. On day 4 I had none of those symptoms but was very tired and did not feel myself; little energy, somewhat lethargic.

At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

                                                I had my first Covid vaccination on Saturday, January 16th. After waiting the obligatory 15 minutes and feeling no side effects, we left to drive back. It was then (about 25 minutes after the shot was received) that I started to feel tingling in my upper gum/lip area. It felt as if I often fo after dentist visit where I&#39;d had Novocain. It lasted about 4 hours and that was the sum of my reactions.   The vaccination was Moderna Lot 041L20A which has been temporarily suspended.

                                                About 3:30 in the morning I woke up and I was really cold. I started having chills. when I checked my temperature it was in the 99s (the highest my temperature 101.9. When I checked my heart rate in the morning and it was in the 90s, and that&#39;s higher than normal for first thing in the morning. My heart rate went high and I had achy muscles. I sat around all day, but I didn&#39;t feel that bad in the morning, I took an extra strength Tylenol and I didn&#39;t have much have an appetite. My heart rate stayed in the 90s-130, so I called my cardiologist and he recommended I alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen and drink lots of fluids. By dinner that night I had no appetite, and then I had nausea and dry heaves, so I took 25 mg of promethazine at about 8 and the dry heaves got better within an hour. I got the COVID tongue. I had a white coating on my tongue and I couldn&#39;t get it off and a weird metallic taste in my mouth, I had a mild headache. The next day I felt much better. I called my PCP and they didn&#39;t think it was necessary for me to come in for a cardiogram because I was feeling better.

I left the waiting room at 11:55.  One hour later, I had an extremely dry mouth &amp; needed water.  It resolved after drinking a bottle of water.  At 4:30pm I started itching in my hands, feet, &amp; entire body - itchiness was like prickles, not normal itching.  Took Claritin which kept itching under control.  I have taken Claritin 10mg daily for the last 5 days to keep itching under control. Today I am more itchy than yesterday.

                                                5-10 minutes after I received the vaccine I had a headache. At first it wasn&#39;t bad, however, that afternoon it worsened and did not improve with Tylenol or Advil. The next day was worse than the first because the headache became very bad and I was unable to do anything besides rest on the sofa. The following day I felt somewhat better but the headache persisted along with eye irritation, burning, and pain. That continued for 2 more days. My headache worsened on Tuesday, February 16. I awoke with a pounding headache in the back of my head. It caused me to become nauseous for several hours which improved by the afternoon.I&#39;ve have never had a migraine but think that&#39;s what this was.  I rested the entire day. Today, Wednesday, February 17, I awoke with a mild headache which worsened during the day. Along with this my eyes ached and I noticed reading words and numbers was difficult because they were blurry. I decided to hold off on taking any pain medication to see whether or not the headache would calm down and it hasn&#39;t; it tends to move around my head during the day. Hopefully, the Tylenol will help today.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the Maderna vaccine my head started hurting which I reported to the doctor on site. She talked to me and said I was ok to go. My headache pain persisted all day and into the next. For the pain I took Tylenol and Advil. The pain has not let-up since the day of my vaccination. In addition to the head pain, I started sneezing and had terrible eye irritation with burning and watering. These side effects are still persisting. The worst, however, is the severe head pain which only settles down when I sleep. I am sleeping only 3-4 hours at night now. I wake up for a bathroom break at 3-4 A M and can&#39;t go back to sleep. My head pain starts after I get up every morning about 1/2 hour to an hour. My doctor recommended taking Extra Strength Tylenol and Advil alternating them and an antihistamine. Functioning day to day and making decisions has been very difficult. But, the pain is the worst!!!

On 04/19/2021 developed redness and swlling nose bridge and forehead, went to see (dermatologist) thinking this to be from the Juvederm injections.  In office diagnosed herpes/shingles, in meantime a pustule/herpetic lesion developed on forehead (picture available). Patient contacted Kaiser and went to Urgent Care, seen referred to dermatology prescribed Valtrex. see page 2Dermatology and seen: diagnosed with varicella zoster .   Also referred to Ophthalmology and seen, diagnosed with Right Herpes Zoster Conjunctivitis.  Prescribed Valtrex PO and Erythromycin opht ointment.   Of concern is that patient received Zoster vaccine in 2009 (?Zostavax, and one dose Shingrix  2018.  Has to her knowledge never had shingles or zoster.  There is no other underlying morbidity specifically no autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or Sjogren disease.  No known contact with persons with shingles or herpes zoster.   The concern is development of zoster and herpetic conjunctivitis  after recent COVID vaccination and Juvederm treatment, while having been vaccinated with Zoster vaccine and Shingrix, without known previous or apparent underlying autoimmune conditions.

That subsided for a minute or two, then started again with a flush feeling down my body.  Nurse took blood pressure 140/80.  Breathing fine. Heart rate fine.  Flush feeling started again, and blood pressure dropped  to100/70.  I was then given 50 mg of Benadryl and an ambulance was called.  My blood pressure stabilized but I was very shaky.  It was recommended that I go to the hospital for observation for a couple of hours, which I did.  I only had the flush feeling once at the hospital.  I was released after two hours.

This started shortly after the injection, It subsided after about 15 to 20 minutes. This is similar to reactions that I&#39;ve had to flu vaccines when I last had one nearly 25 years ago.  It is also similar to my reaction to numbing shots where epinephrine is in the shot.

I took some Benadryl and the symptoms resolved.  I woke up around 6AM on 1/24 and the symptoms were back.  I took more Benadryl and the symptoms resolved .  Around 1:30Pm on 1/24 symptoms reappeared took more Benadryl and decided to go the ER at 2:30PM.  When I got there the symptoms had resolved again  The Doctor determined that  my Asthma had been exacerbated by the Vaccine.I was treated with intravenous steroids and Benadryl.  I was also treated by the Respiratory HCP with Albuterol - 4 puffs at 3:30PM and again at 6:00PM with 2 puffs of Albuterol.  I was given a prescription for Prednisone 50mg  for 5 days. I was released at 6;30PM.   I felt fine after coming home.  I saw my healthcare specialist on 1/25.  It was a scheduled appt.  and I told him about my side effects and he told me to please report them to you and to my Primary healthcare provider.

Both the nausea and severe migraine lasted for 54 hours after onset.  The first evening I also experienced teeth-chattering chills.  Finally saw an improvement around 2:00 a.m. on Monday morning, February 1, when I woke up in a total sweat.  By daylight on February 1, the nausea and migraine were  gone, but I experienced mild dizziness and blurry vision.  By Tuesday morning, February 2, I am more or less back to normal, although my vision is still a bit blurry and the dizziness still present if I move my head too quickly.

Then recovered and it lasted 3 days and woke up feeling dizzy in head.  Sudden raise for blood pressure which kept fluctuating during 2 days, reaching at worst 199/103! Finally came down with doctor&#39;s help and adjusting some existing medication and adding Tylenol to the mix.

                                                Came home after vaccine, and felt bump in her arm where the injection was.  Didn&#39;t think too much of it.  The next morning her cousin came over and compared notes, and verified she had the bump.  She kept rubbing it and massaging it to break it down, and got a little sore, but nothing severe.  No sickness, a little pain over her eye.  Then on Friday 1/29/21, noticed a small spot on her arm, by Saturday got bigger, and today it has started moving to the bottom side of her upper arm.  Is applying ice and it&#39;s getting better.   Has been exercising it and stretching it as literature she found to do that.
