                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

                                                After sitting  for about 10 minutes, I noticed my tongue was swelling up in the back of my throat. I noticed my airway was narrowed and tongue felt very tight, but I was still able to breath. I told the man at the doorway assigned to help people find a seat after their shots. He said, &#34;We all have different reactions,&#34; brought me water, and I drank it.  After another 10 minutes, the symptoms were the same, not better not worse. After 10 more minutes the symptoms were better. And after another 10 minutes, I left.  When I made it back to my car, I noticed tightening across my forehead. This developed into a frontal lobe headache which continued off and on for the next 3 days. Also noted for the next 2 days was waking with swollen lips, face and extremities, and occasional ringing in the ears lasting 1-2 hours.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

She put eye drops in eye when she got home and ate with no difficulty.  She spoke with her doctor today.

                                                At approximately 3:30 pm the next day (27 hours later), I noticed significant tearing from both eyes, while outside walking. When I returned home, and checked in the mirror, I noticed significant puffiness around the eyes (though not to the point of closure or impaired vision), especially in the inner corners (L&gt;R). I contacted my PCP at 4:45 pm and was instructed to go to the Urgent Care. I was seen there and evaluated, then was discharged without any treatment plan. I had no other symptoms and felt great, and even felt the puffiness had subsided a little bit by the time I left the clinic. Today, 1/8/2021, at 7:30 am awakening, the eyes are quite puffy again, and my nose actually appears a bit swollen on the sides near the eyes. I hear clicking sounds in my sinuses and have a small amount of sinus pressure. I applied ice packs to the eye lids in an effort to reduce swelling, which seems to help a little.   Please note that I had botox in my forehead and around the outside corners of the eyes, and dermal filler under the eyes (12/7/2021), this being the first time for the filler.

All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Walked in the bathroom had pain in stomach, was very hot and freezing at the same time, was shaking. Head hurt was hurting so bad. Tried standing up from toilet, was passed out. Eye, half of face is bruised and swollen , eye shut for two days. More than forty minutes passed before she could call her husband. Does not remember anything because she was passed out. Husband came in and grabbed her, to get her back into bed. she could not stand. Went to ER at  Hospital. Had CT scan, blood work , EKG, chest xray. Was still kind of out of it but was able to communicate with nurses. Face is still black and blue. Last night got up at 4:00 a.m. something was wrong with her throat. Felt like a walnut was in her throat. Went to doctor this morning. They said it was a reaction from the shot. Got an EpiPen, prednisone. Call them in 2 days to let them know how she&#39;s doing and also wear a heart monitor because they do not know how to take care of her, Has had vision blurriness in both eyes. Has not felt well at all.

                                                Waited at the vaccine location 30 minutes and felt fine, driving home started to feel tingling and numbness on lips, face, face was puffy, mouth was dry, hard to swallow. Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

However, I could breathe easily so I just remained to relax and slowly swallowing my salia over and over again. Once home took a benedryl and was able to drink water without any problems. My throat is still somewhat scratchy after 2 hours.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

On March 19, 2021 she was on the floor laying beside of the bed and my father noticed blood looking stuff on her shirt and bed covers. She was really confused and lethargic. She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

                                                Upon awakening the morning after the vaccination, I experienced swelling in my ankles, feet and fingers I also experienced swelling in my face where I had received filler injections six months ago. I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

                                                Started with itching and rash at injection site. Went away in 2 days. Next day palm of hands and soles of feet became very itchy. Then progressed to whole body itching. Unable to sleep for two nights. Went to urgent care next morning. Was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg. Itching went away that night and was able to sleep. Next day bilateral hands had numbness and tingling and general dizziness so stopped taking hydroxyzine. Went to family practitioner and was prescribed methylprednisolone dose pack. After starting steroids, by 2nd day (today - 1-21-21), hands continued n/t. Bilateral feet developed n/t. Dizziness continues when standing but goes away when sitting. Balance and gait are unsteady. Difficulty walking from weakness, balance issues, and dizziness.

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

                                                After receiving my shot on Friday, my arm began to get sore, my ears felt like they were on fire.  I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 I felt a little strange.  Just not myself. A little dizzy.  Went to work overnight.  Got up at 5 am Friday, Jan 8, 2021.  Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

Felt swollen, but dont think it was, burning sensation on lateral borders and tip of tongue,extremely dry mouth.  Felt as though it had also been burned, and had a few white spots on tip, reddened borders on lateral aspects also, very scallopededges. Note I do have a fissured tongue but this reaction was unlike any I had ever had from eating certain foods that trigger any tongue response, and had not eaten anything night before to trigger this. Lasted a few days and progressively felt normal after 3-4 days.

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

                                                The afternoon after I developed chills and had goose bumps all over.  I didnt have a fever but the chills went on for several hrs so I took 2 500mg tylenol and the chills ended around 5pm.  I developed a headache and still had to continue to drink plenty water because my mouth got that super dry feeling again.  I went home ate and relaxed until I fell asleep.  I had body aches and because my arm was hurting I couldnt lay on that side.  I took benedryl and tylenol before bed. Today I still feel very very tired, fatigued and my body still aches.  My arm is still really red, warm to the touch and has a nice knot at the injection site and the headache comes and goes.

And eyes started feeling puffy especially my left one but when I looked in the mirror nothing was swollen.  About 30 minutes later I took a Benadryl.   It started feeling better but the sensation took about 24 hours to go away totally on my face and a few hours later for my eyes to feel normal.

                                                Approximately 20 to 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I had what appeared to be a seasonal allergic reaction, in which I could not stop sneezing and my eye tearing.  This continued throughout the evening and night but not as intense as when it first began.  I awoke at 1:00 AM to a very intense sneezing and eye tearing, but on only the left side of my face and eventually both sides.  I took Allegra D and did get relief.  The sneezing (allergic rhinitis) reaction continued but after almost an hour of taking the Allegra D , it was not as intense.  My face also appeared swollen but only with respect of atypical allergic rhinitis intense reaction.

On the 12th I noticed a raised area in the injection site. I took an Advil .  On the 13th my arm started getting hard near the injection site with some redness. On that day I took a Benadryl once and Advil BID. Today the arm is very hard, red and is warm to the touch. My temp is 100.2. I took 80 mg ASA and a hour later took an Advil.  I reported all my Sx w/ Moderna. They recommended that I call my PMD for Tx. I contacted my PMD and the health department for treatment and they referred me to CDC. No treatment was suggested or given

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included two time cancer survivor . Concomitant medications reported included Carvedilol for high blood pressure, acetamide for cholesterol, potassium, multivitamins, zinc, calcium, Vitamin D.  On 05 Feb,  prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 031L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Patient was ok at midnight, but when they woke up, they felt very dizzy, were vomiting that day, and experienced extreme tiredness for 3 weeks, now they feel relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired, probably related to not been able to eat on account of having very limited appetite. They mentioned they had limited bowel function, and their bladder felt full, like they could not empty it. Patient states they had a dry mouth from  the beginning of the symptoms.  After a week of these symptoms, on Saturday, the patient went to a clinic and they did some bloodwork and found that the liver enzymes were elevated and 5 more values were not normal and that their kidney function was not normal.  They consulted with their oncologist and they believed these could be an extreme immune response to the vaccine, since the lab work conducted on the 23Dec2020 was normal.  Last Friday they have some blood tests and the values were back to normal.  Treatment for the events included paracetamol and ibuprofen alternating; and  Prednisone.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, dizziness, vomiting, fatigue, dry mouth were relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired.  The outcome events,  urinary retention,  decreased appetite,   and limited bowel function are unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                When I first got the vaccine I was fine but as the day went on I felt soreness in my left arm with some stiffness in my neck. Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

On the same day, I began to have difficulty with my vision , especially in the left eye, a headache and all my joints began to ache. I was also very tired. The symptoms progressively got worse  over the following two weeks and included a couple of episodes of heart rhythm irregularities . During the third week, the headache, eye issues and joint pain began to resolve but the tinnitus is debilitating and prevents me from mentally focusing or sleeping.

                                                I received the vaccine yesterday 1/6/21.  Today, 1/7/21, I went for my walk this morning and felt off balance/swayed to the right a bit at one point. I don&#39;t think lightheadedness precipitated this, but it unnerved me.  I steadied myself and finished the walk without a problem. I checked and surface/pavement was uneven. My temp is 97.5 and I feel fine now but am just a little nervous that is a possible reaction to the vaccine. I had a reaction to the second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine 10 yrs ago, I fainted in early morning hours after getting up to go to bathroom.  I had received the second dose at about 11:30a the day before, and developed flu like symptoms by afternoon with a fever and ended up dehydrated which I think contributed to my fainting at about 3a when I got up to void.  I had a concussion and was treated with IV fluids at the local ED.

She was noted to have significant nongranulomatous anterior chamber reaction (2&#43; cell). There was no hypopyon or keratic precipitates. She was symptomatic with pain and light sensitivity in the right eye only. (Of note, the left eye was quiet. It had undergone cataract surgery and recently discontinued postoperative steroid drops). I discontinued the Tobradex and start Durezol drops every 2 hours. Of note, she has no history of uveitis. I saw her again 1/12/21 with complete resolution of the inflammation. She is currently tapering down on the topical steroid. I will see her again on 1/26/21 while taking Durezol 1x/day. This should be about 3 days from her second vaccination

Pulse rate elevated but attendant said not &#34;critically high.&#34; Breathing was normal. After about 20 minutes I started feeling better. Oddly, while sitting in observation room, my sinuses cleared up, and I detected an odd taste at the back of my throat. Developed  frontal headache about same time; took acetaminophen and it went away after 12 hours.

Throughput the evening, the tingling sensation progressed up the left side of my neck and my ear.  My ear felt similar s to Novacaine wearing off after a dental visit. During the night my throat got a similar sensation and created the need to try coughing it out. By 24 hours after the injection I was tired, with sore joints and muscle aches. By 36 hours I was still sleeping it off and at 48 hours I feel pretty well back to normal.

While driving home my face became warm, after arriving home face/cheeks extremely red/flushed.  Have a picture taken at 3:54 for documentation. Not sure if from anxiety, but felt jaw tightness and a thick tongue.  No itching, swallowing problems etc.   lasted approximately 15 minutes. By 4:57 pm redness had faded.   Picture documentation. 9:15 pm had right ear pain and mild reddened of right cheek.   Picture documentation.

                                                Headache after the inacoulation on Tuesday 12/29. Two days later I started hearing a ring in my right ear. The ring went away on Wednesday 1/6. However on Friday morning 1/8 I woke up with a headache and body aches more pronounced in my waist and abdomen. I took my temparture and it was 98.8 F. I started taking Tylenol 500 mg. every 6 to 8 hours. On Saturday 1/9 the chills came back around 8 pm. I continued taking 2 Tylenol every 6 or 8 hours until now Sunday 1/10 at 4:30 pm. I am still experiencing sore abdomen and joins.

After sitting down I experienced visual disturbance in my right eye of blurred vision and corona of bright lines that zigzagged. These symptoms slowly resolved over the next hour, but left with extreme fatigue.

                                                Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss in left ear. Symptoms began Friday evening Jan. 8, 2021. Sounded like muffled sound in my ear, water running, ringing. Then on Saturday Jan.9, 2021 my left ear felt like it had to pop and I felt my hearing was impaired.  By Sunday evening Jan. 10, 2021, I could barely hear out of my left ear. I called MD immediately Monday morning, Jan. 11, 2021 and was seen that afternoon. I was examined and had a hearing test. I was diagnosed with SSHL and started treatment of a series of steroid injections directly into my eardrum to save my hearing immediately. I have had 2 injections and hearing test since then. The doctors feel this was a side effect of the COVID vaccine due to my compromised immune system, but not an allergic reaction, but a side effect. I had the same condition about 15 years ago from a virus.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

                                                Patient is a 69 y.o. female with history of multiple medical problems as indicated below including rheumatoid arthritis.  She is a non-smoker.  She tells me she has &#34;a heart condition&#34; and is followed by a cardiologist. She tells me she was in her usual state of health and took her COVID-19 first vaccine today.  Approximately 30 seconds later she noted chest tightness/burning that has been constant.  It is rated 9/10 at maximum and improved to 5/10 after about 10 to 15 minutes.  She also states, &#34;my eyes feel funny.  I feel cold.  I am dizzy.&#34; She endorses palpitations and dyspnea. She denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, diaphoresis, headache, cough, rash, or syncope. She does have a history of seafood allergies and had similar reactions after eating seafood. She tells me 3 years ago after a flu shot she fainted.  She tells me the past 2 years after her flu shot she had nausea or vomiting. She tells me she fell yesterday and hurt her hip but she did not hit her head.  No LOC. She tells me she takes baby aspirin nightly. Family history: Mom and dad both died at age 82 from lung cancer.  They both had heart disease.   She was sent back from the vaccination area to urgent care to be evaluated after her reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                Within 1/2 hr. of receiving the vaccine, the left side of my face went tingling/numb.  By evening it became very painful.  Pain running from behind my left ear over my left checks, including upper and lower jaw on left side.  By morning, I had blisters on top of my palate and part of my throat and in my sinus&#39;.   Pain became increasingly worse over next few days.  Now on medication for it. I am hesitant to receive the second shot as I don&#39;t want to go through this again.  Please advise.

The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

                                                Passed out; Unsteady; Slurring her words; Fell into a deep sleep; Tingly in her upper right arm; Feels like equilibrium is off; Legs feel heavy; Fatigue; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 71-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced passing out (loss of consciousness), unsteadiness (gait disturbance), slurring words (dysarthria), fell into a deep sleep (hypersomnia), tingly feeling in her upper right arm (paraesthesia), felt like equilibrium was off (balance disorder), legs felt heavy (limb discomfort), and fatigue.  The patient&#39;s medical history included epilepsy.  Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included clonazepam.  On 03 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient was slurring her words and fell into a deep sleep.  It took three individuals to wake her up.  The patient wondered if she passed out.  She felt tingly in her upper right arm and it felt like her equilibrium was off, and legs were heavy.  The patient was very fatigued.    Treatments of these events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, passing out, unsteadiness, slurring words, fell into a deep sleep, tingly feeling in her upper right arm, felt like equilibrium was off, legs felt heavy and fatigue, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71 year old female subject, with history of epilepsy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness after first dose of mRNA1273 (Lot# unknown). Concomitant medication included clonazepam. Very limited information has been provided at this time. Further information has been requested.

                                                About 1 hour and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine I became dizzy.  3 1/5 hours later I developed chills which lastly briefly. The next day I had  huge area on my  left eye on my pupil which lasted for 5 days. I have blue eyes and right at toward the end of the blue I have white deposits.  On  2/24/2021 I went  see an eye doctor Dr. He diagnosed me with &#34;whiss&#34; ring around both of my eyes, and seen spot on my lenses on my left eye.  I started starburst with my left eye, this did not develop until after I received the vaccine.  I have a dot on my right eye now. On 02/26/2021 see another eye doctor Dr., he also said I have deposits around my cornea, acknowledged the starburst effect on the left eye, and noticed the &#34;whiss&#34; ring.  Since I took the vaccine my eyes have become very light sensitive.  The doctors have told me this conditions are permanent, if it gets worse they will have to scrape the eye and have a laser surgery.  I do  not remember when it started but it 2inches by 3 inches, red patch which started at the injection site and went diagonal.

                                                Neurology consult note 2/16: The patient is a 72-year-old woman, who states that last Friday she began to notice a strange fullness and numbness and perhaps a mild degree of weakness in her right leg and came to  Emergency Room.  She was seen by ER doctors.  Diagnosis was unclear.  She was offered admission to get physical therapy, but she did not wish to stay for the weekend and returned home on Friday the evening only to come back to the ER on Sunday, 2 days later with progression of further right leg weakness, right leg numbness and a hint of new left-sided symptoms that had not begun before Sunday.  None of her symptoms involve the arms or face and everything was below the waist.  There was no significant pain.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday and has lost the ability to void.  Her MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine was reviewed by me on the computer monitor and was unrevealing except for mild DJD.  Thoracic MRI scan shows possible spinal cord infarction versus myelitis occurring within the thoracic spine at the dorsal surface of the cord at the T5 and T6 vertebral body levels to the right of midline.  This was a faint finding and not clearly infarct or myelitis and could be artifact.  It appears that she has hydronephrosis on her scans too and now is using a Foley catheter.  She does have a history of high cholesterol for which she takes a statin at home and was taking a baby aspirin a day when the above symptoms occurred. In summary, the patient has a 72-year-old woman, who presents with progressive right lower extremity weakness and now evolving left lower extremity weakness.  This may be related to an autoimmune process such as myelitis or less commonly cord ischemia.  Normally, I would start her on Plavix, but I think she may need to undergo spinal tap tomorrow if MRI scan of the brain and cervical spine are unrevealing.  Patients with mild hyperglycemia can develop a diabetic amyotrophy or lumbosacral plexopathy simply related to diabetes, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Speaking against this would be that her reflexes are intact at both knees at 2&#43; to 3 and slightly brisk, 1&#43; at both ankles and 1&#43; and symmetric in the upper extremities.  We will hold aspirin for today.  Consider LP for tomorrow, but have not ordered as we will try to avoid and hopefully the imaging studies I have ordered will be sufficient.  We will continue to follow.  While admitted to this facility, she was treated with IV dexamethasone 2/14-2/21  She was admitted to an inpatient hospital 2/14-2/23 and discharged to an inpatient rehab unit at a different health system.

March 7th right hand went numb again and had vision problems with right eye, cleared up in about 15 minutes.  March 9th right hand and right side of face went numb.  Went to hospital and was examined and told I was having a stroke.  I was admitted to hospital for two days.  MRI showed that I had a stroke and now have some brain tissue damage.  I and now going to occupational therapy to regain use of right hand.  The Doctors thought that it was pretty coincidental that my first stroke symptom (transient numb right hand on the 6th) started just a couple days after I got the second dose of the moderna vaccine.

Into the night I began vomiting (which lasted all night)  I became feverish, had chills with body shaking, extreme nausea. (temp 102) This persisted to the next day and I went to the ER.  There I was given  multiple liters of IV fluids,  IV Zofran and IV Tylenol.   I felt better after treatment but still had the intense headache and ringing in the ears.  The next day, I&#39;m now gradually beginning to feel better, just weak.  I can eat today, two days after the injection and slowly beginning to feel better.   This reaction was terrible for me.

                                                Moderna Shot on February 23, 2021. Tired, sluggish and headache along with some ringing in the head.  March 22, 2021 I had second Moderna shot. My arm was very swollen, fatigue and bad headache with loud ringing in the head. My blood pressure accelerated  to nearly 200/88 and had to be admitted to the ER three days after shot. I was in the hospital for two days and had a series of CAT scans and ultrasounds.  Loud ringing in my head has not stopped. Never had a history of high blood pressure, but now they put me on high blood pressure medication along with the baby aspirin. I was a relatively healthy woman until I had these vaccinations.

I left the waiting room at 11:55.  One hour later, I had an extremely dry mouth &amp; needed water.  It resolved after drinking a bottle of water.  At 4:30pm I started itching in my hands, feet, &amp; entire body - itchiness was like prickles, not normal itching.  Took Claritin which kept itching under control.  I have taken Claritin 10mg daily for the last 5 days to keep itching under control. Today I am more itchy than yesterday.

Hospital admission that evening. 2/26 Steroid treatment stopped headaches and eye pain. 2/27 released from hospital after BP was &lt;160.  Diagnosis-migraines possibly triggered by vaccine.  Pain/nausea elevated BP and decreased food intake which caused low blood sodium levels. IV treatments to increase sodium and lower BP. Dizziness from low sodium and high BP created fall risk, so bed had alarm.  Bed confinement necessitated daily injections to prevent blood clots.  Twice daily blood tests done to monitor sodium and potassium levels &#43; kidney function.
