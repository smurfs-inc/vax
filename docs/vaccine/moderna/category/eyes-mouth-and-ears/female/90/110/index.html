By Monday/Feb 1, pain was severe and she could not chew anything . I was able to get an appt with the dentist on Tuesday/Feb 1 at 930am. We treated at home with Tylenol, very soft foods and rest/heat/ice. Pain, discomfort was gone by Tuesday Feb 1.  I did not realize this could be a side effect of the vaccine, but since it came on after receiving the shot and disappeared 3 days after the shot, believe it was a reaction to the shot.

The patient has prior history of irregular heart beat . Her relevant concomitant medications were cholesterol medication, Crestor and medication for irregular heartbeat. No information on allergies.   On 28-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received her first of two planned doses of COVID-19 vaccine intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30-JAN-2021, 2 days after her vaccination, she developed arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, some visual problems (light bothered her for some days) and mild chills. After one week she felt like no more symptoms ongoing and felt good again. She visited her physician for arrhythmias, and he said, she should keep an eye on it, but no medication yet. She is concerned about her second shot.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.  The outcome of the events, arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, visual problems and chills were resolved at the time of report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of irregular heart beat are considered risk factors for arrhythmias.

                                                Today around 3pm I administered a first Moderna shot to a patient.  She had a long list of allergies to various medications and eggs.  I advised her that I would like her to sit for 30 minutes after her shot to be monitored due to this.  At about 3:27pm she informed me her upper lip felt tingly. I then offered her 25mg of Benadryl which she took.  She waited another 20 minutes and her symptoms felt about the same and she wanted to go home.  I offered her another dose of Benadryl or if she wanted me to call EMS.  She denied both and bought some Benadryl to take home.  I advised her to take another dose if symptoms did not improve or to call EMS if they worsen.  She left the pharmacy about 355pm.

No fever, no aches, arm didn&#39;t hurt, no nausea, was able to continue working so no change in mental status.  Lasted until 1/23/2021 and stopped completely. Is asymptomatic now.

The retinologist instructed her to go to the ER.  My mother was admitted for futher evaluation.  Her protime in the ER was 1.7.  MRI of head was otherwise negative for changes.   Her protime had been stable between 2.0 and 3.0 for years.  At her follow-up  appointment with her doctor, her protime was 1.8.  Her Coumadin dose has been adjusted,

                                                My mom received her first Moderna Vaccine on 1/22/21. Late on 1/23 her face began to swell so the staff called the ambulance to come take her to the hospital for what they thought was an abscessed tooth. ER doctor said there was an infection and that she needed to be seen by an oral surgeon. On 1/25/21 I took my mom to Dr., her oral surgeon and after the examination he advised that there was no abscess but an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He suggested Benadryl. I gave her benadryl and the swelling started subsiding. From this point on her gums and teeth hurt. Her eating habits started to decline. She received her 2nd Moderna vaccine on 2/19/21 and from that point on she could no longer chew or brush her teeth because the pain was so severe. She passed on 3/19/21.
