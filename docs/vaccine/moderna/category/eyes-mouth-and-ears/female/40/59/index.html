                                                I took the Moderna Covid vaccine on 12-28-2020 at 1420. After getting the shot, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and drank some water then waited 20 mins. When I left to go back to my department, I started getting dizzy and coughing. I sat down in my department and could not stop coughing so I went to the ER department. My eyes were swollen, I had a rash from my arms and legs all the way down my body. I had hives on my face and my eyes were swollen. I was coughing and wheezing. the ER RN started an IV and I was given steroids, diphenhydramine, ondansetron and IV fluids. I was also given some cough medicine. I was monitored for a few hours and before I left - they gave me hydroxyzine for the hives and itching. The PA also ordered meds for me to take at home.      - per patient report

My tongue was still numb but not getting any worse so i felt it was ok to leave. I decided to go home after those 2 hours and i took 10 min of zyrtec and about 5 hours later i still had a little numbness and tingling on the right side of the tongue but the rest of the tongue and lip had resolvedf. Had fatigue and myalgia for the rest of the day.

I sat with her and she had progressive tingling, worsening throat tightness and some facial swelling under her eye.  We then moved her to a room and laid her down.  I discussed the use of the Epipen and a dose was given at approximately 400PM.  We also called 911 at that time.  Vitals were taken and EMS arrived and by the time they were taking her away her symptoms were improving.

                                                Update: Already made one report on January 13th describing how right hand and upper lip was numb. Right hand numbness lasted 4 hours then returned to normal. Upper lip numbness lasted 10&#43; hours and resolved sometime during that night when I was sleeping. On 14th when woke up (numbness gone) but had about an inch redness around injection site with a 7mm× 7mm lump under skin where injection given sore to touch.  On 15th site reaction still there and felt low on energy. Today 16th then redness seems to be a bit better and taking on more darkish hue (maybe turning into bruise?) And lump feels slightly smaller and not as sore. So site reaction might be on the way towards healing. However today I have been fatigued and drained feeling, low on energy. ( Dr notified of numbness post injection, and pic of arm via online portal. (No reply from Dr as of this date).  Seem to be on mend other than increasing fatigue, low on energy.

                                                Had Moderna 1st shot on Jan 7. Eye infection that night and the next day. Then, Saturday the 16th, a tickle in my chest.. soon produced a dry cough in relief/response to the tickle. Next day, I was hoarse (Sunday the 17th). Still hoarse. Sore throat off and on. Headache. Body aches. Incredible arthritis-like ache at the tops of my shoulders, upper back, and neck. Runny nose. Spitting mucous - was clear, now some thick solid white. Chest pain in the middle that comes and goes. Chest pain on left center side - it feels like in the area of my heart. Ache in my lower left side. Today, aching in my jaws mostly left side, but both. Ache on upper right front (lung area?). INCREDIBLY tired. It&#39;s so hard to stay awake.

                                                I was vaccinated on 12-30 after 4 pm.  By 3:30 on 12-31 my neck quickly swelled up, my throat becoming sore, glands swollen, headache, and fatigue were my first symptoms. An unusual symptom occurred from day 2-6. My facial skin did not hurt unless I applied pressure. When I applied pressure it felt bruised and highly sensitive but didn&#39;t hurt unless pressure was applied.  I also developed a small sore along my gum line on the bottom right front of my mouth.  Both of these symptoms disappeared after day 6. 7-8 days after receiving the vaccine my neck, jaw and shoulders became extremely stiff, including a runny nose. This symptom has persisted and is the worst of all symptoms (jaw and neck stiffness and sore throat). On day 12 in addition to the ongoing sore throat,  and stiffness in my neck and jaw I developed white spots on my right tonsil.  3 days after the white spots disappeared, but the red sore throat is current. On day 20, I developed 2 more sores on the right side of my mouth. One on the bottom gum line and one on the top right gum line (this feels like a canker sore). Today I have a slight earache in my right ear.   NOTE: I tested positive to COVID June 2020. I ended up taking 1 month off work due to persistent symptoms. I still cannot properly smell and taste, and I can smell water.  Occasionally, the brain fog from COVID comes up but that is more rare.

                                                I waited the 15 min at the clinic and felt okay. As I got a few minutes down the road (at about 4:00) my lips began to feel tingly this then spread to my teeth and face. I could feel my throat begin to tighten. At that point I call the clinic and they suggested I go to ER to get looked at.  Got to ER and Tingling and numbness continued, throat had started to loosen up some but felt thick and heavy. I also had a headache that was more like pressure all over then stabbing and my teeth and jaw ached. Doctor saw me between 4:30 and 5 sometime gave me diphenhydrAMINE 50 mg by mouth, famotidine 20 mg by mouth and dexamethasone 10 mg by mouth.  By 5:45 symptoms were dissipating and I started to feel more normal. By 6:45 I felt much better (just very fatigued from the medications and slight headache still), and was discharged from E.R. sometime a little after 7. Through the night I had headache and hot flashes. Next morning some face swelling  and tongue swelling still as well as tightness in throat (mild) continue to take Benadryl as suggested by E.R. doctor.

                                                Went out to car around 25 min after with only mild throat discomfort.  Shortly after, was having difficulty swallowing, felt dizzy &amp; face swelling.  Took quick release (dissolve under tongue) prednisolone 20 mg (have for peanut allergy).  Symptoms didn&#39;t initially improve, used albuetrol inhaler and returned to hospital.  Swelling symptoms started feeling better.  Blood pressure when first checked was very high, still at 170/118 at 21:54.  Sent to ED.  Wheezing and constant throat clearing in ED, used inhaler again &amp; symptoms improved.  BP still high for me at 138/80 at 21:54 with patchy confluent erythema over anterior chest that blanches, non-pruritic &amp; 3-4 hives on abdomen.  Given Benadryl 50 mg, famotidine 50 mg &amp; dexamethasone 10 mg at 22:22.  At 23:09, chest rash resolved, but pruritis &amp; mild urticaria to back and arms.  At 23:41, urticartia resolved &amp; discharged.  After second dose of Decadron was delayed the following day, itchy hives returned on chest, stomach, back and left shoulder.  Same occurred on the 3rd day, along with wheezing (resolved by other meds &amp; inhaler) and more steroids were prescribed.  This resolved the remaining symptoms.

Cried for my husband. Dripping sweat gave me a cold rag and foam large diarrhea began. Still 10/10 pain in abdomen. Felt like my lower abdomen was getting ripped out.  About 45 minutes or so later still 10/10 wanted to go to ER. I could not stand. If I stood my legs and body felt like I wanted to curl in a ball on the floor. He called an ambulance.

                                                With in 5 mins of getting my shot I started to get sweaty and my heart starting getting bad palpitations.  I could feel myself get super flush, I could feel my whole body warming.   I had a hard time swallowing and my tongue burned and felt swollen.  My throat would just get super tight. Each episode lasted under a minute This happened on and off it for about 30 minutes.  Each time it happened it was not as bad as the time prior.  I was dizzy when I tried to stand up and I sat and was monitored for an hour.  They administered  Benadryl.   I have some edema on my upper chest when I got home.  I was super tired too. The next day still the edema and I have a sore throat .   I explained the best I could to the pharmacist when it was happening .  I refused to get EMT because it was not constant and it was getting less intense each time.

                                                On Wednesday, Feb 17, I experienced an earache in my left ear and an eye twitch in the left eye, which continued to Thursday , Feb 18.  On Feb 18,  also experienced extreme fatigue and a jabbing, throbbing pain behind my left ear that came and went all day.  I also noticed when I brushed my teeth that I had a hard time swishing water in my mouth, especially on the left side.  On Friday morning, I woke up and noticed my left eyelid was drooping and my smile was lopsided.  As I have a history of hemiplegic migraine, I assumed I was experiencing a migraine, although this was not the usual course of these migraines, and I had not had one of these types of migraines in many years.  The left side of my head, behind my ear, and wrapping from my neck to my temple continued to hurt (but not as painful as a normal migraine).  Thinking I was in a chronic migraine state, I took 40 mg of Prednisone, as I have done before to &#39;cut through&#39; the migraine.  When the facial weakness did not resolve by the next day, I suspected this was not migraine and instead suspected Bell&#39;s Palsy and consulted my physician.  Looking back in time, I also realized that I had experienced some adverse tingling/taste sensations on part of my tongue as far back as February 8, that felt similar to burning your tongue from drinking too hot liquids that I realized later could have also been part of the Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                5 am - sore arm - a little swollen. That evening of the second day at about 7 pm - I had body aches and a low grade fever.  The third day, I felt back to normal and my arm was back to normal. The following week, the day after I tested positive for COVID, so that was January 7th. The arm was itchy and burny. It had a big rash on that area. (January 6 My upper back was hurting really bad and I had a fever. I wasn&#39;t feeling good at all. Had shortness of breath. So I went for a COVID test.) The rash lasted for about 48 hours and then it was gone. I didn&#39;t take anything for it. My other COVID symptoms lasted for about 6 days. I still didn&#39;t have taste though. I got that back on about day 10. I had the shortness of breath (feeling out of breath) which lasted a week and a half longer than when I felt better from the other COVID symptoms.  I treated COVID symptoms with VIT C; Vit D3 and tylenol.

Fatigue,  severe muscle aches, joint pain, headache,  nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, chills to point shaking still come in waves.  This is day 7 and I could barely put one foot in front other after work to get in bed but vomited first.  Today, odd pressure in my face developed and headache came and went and again, the fatigue, muscle and joint pain are intense.  I&#39;m still working, but have had to take time off, go in late, etc.  Brain fog is a thing.  It feels like it did when I &#34;didn&#39;t have COVID-19&#34; before but had every symptoms and I was going to die, but in waves.  I was dizzy, saw stars and black spots in my right eye today on and off and vision in my right eye honestly seems to have significantly decline.  I&#39;m really just concerned that it is day 7.

She also stated that her friend described her as flushed. This occurred for almost one hour and then resolved on its own. This numb tongue sensation is not abnormal for this patient as it has occured when she eats seafood.

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) &amp; 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), &amp; 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable. Injection arm a little sore, no redness or swelling at site of injection. Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl. Did not have complete resolution of swelling but did improve. Mild hives, swelling of hands and feet. 1/2/21 All joint pain is gone, and injection site pain is only noticeable if someone bumps into my arm. 6a 25mg Benadryl &amp; Pepcid 10a 25mg Benadryl 2p 25mg of Benadryl 3:30pm felt fine all day with only mild swelling and redness to hands, ate chicken nachos. Face became very hot (like my face was too close to the oven when I open it), redness from eyes down, lips swollen, mild itchiness too the tongue but nothing too concerning. 4p 25mg Benadryl I strongly believe the exacerbating factor is eating as all times the symptoms increased in intensity I had just eaten. After discussion with Dr. will be cutting out chicken (chicken was eaten before all 3 instances) and all other meats until complete resolution of symptoms and will avoid any inflammatory foods such as nuts, berries and shellfish. 7p 25mg Benadryl &amp; Claritin taken 7:30p ate a banana, no reaction 8p Singular taken 9:30p put Vaseline on my lips, face &amp; ears flamed hot and swelling and redness followed. 9:45p took 25mg Benadryl 10:25p tongue thick feeling 11p took 25mg Benadryl tongue still feels thick 1/3/21 Fevers 101.6 and chills started in the night Face and lips are permanently swollen and red despite all the meds I?m taking.Lymph nodes are all swollen. I?m too afraid to eat for fear of more swelling while my face is already so swollen.

Within about 60 seconds of receiving it, my heart started pounding hard and rapidly and I let a nurse know. She took my vitals and my heart rate was very high, as was my blood pressure. My O2 was fine. I had some tightness and heaviness I my chest. I felt flush in my cheeks, but did not have hives. The nurse said my color was very pale. I was warm, given an ice pack, and then a bit later cold. At one point they wanted me to go to the Emergency Department, which I refused (perhaps stupidly). I&#39;m not sure I was thinking clearly. I was trying very hard to stay calm and relaxed. My blood pressure was very elevated for about an hour and a half. They finally let me go home when I was 140/95 (my usual is 110 over 70 ish). I had some tongue tingling at home, very briefly.

                                                About 10 minutes after the shot, my chest felt very hot and spread to both my left and right arm down to my elbows. Simultaneously, I experienced a weird taste in my mouth that was not metallic. My heart rate increased. I sought help immediately. My chest was a bit painful. That subsided a bit and then both arms felt tingly from my elbows to my wrists. That subsided and came back, milder each time. This lasted for about 50 minutes before I was allowed to leave and go home. I am typing this 7 hours later and my tongue feels a bit swollen (not unusual based on my food allergies and am not concerned to go to the hospital), and my chest still hurts a bit. I am wondering if it&#39;s anxiety at this point. My breathing and speaking have been totally fine. I got home with no trouble. I rested for several hours just to make sure I did not overexert myself.

                                                I waited 15minutes at the facility and then began walking home. Approximately 30minutes after receiving the injection, my throat started swelling a bit and the back of my tongue seemed to swell, too. It was very hard to swallow. I removed my Covid mask and continued to breathe normally. Approximately 40 minutes after receiving the injection, I took 2 Benadryl tablets. The throat swelling eased but it was still much more difficult to swallow than usual. About 4 hours after my first dose of Benadryl, I took 1 more tablet of Benadryl. I fell asleep and woke up feeling completely normal with normal swallowing. Note: at no time did I have a rash, I did not wheeze, and my blood pressure and heart rate seemed normal. I have no history of allergic reactions beyond possibly reacting to penicillin when I was age 2.

My tongue was tingling and numb, they gave me something, I believe it was Benadryl, twice, 2 shots. I can&#39;t recall. I was like in shock, maybe after 4 hours later I started feeling a little better and returned to work.  The next day my eyes and lips were swollen, a little bit puffy. I kept taking more Benadryl and I felt like I was hit by a semi truck for a week afterwards, it was awful. I was beyond exhausted.  Mid week last week I finally started having my energy back.

Pt described that symptoms had &#34;mostly&#34; resolved by time she left the ED after midnight and that was completely resolved when awakened from normal sleep at 7:00am today.    This RN obtained patient&#39;s visit note from the 01/18/2021 event.  Summary as follows:  Pt presented to Emergency Department with complaint of perioral paresthesia and earlier in the evening that sides of mouth &#34;drew up.&#34;  Pt feared stroke and presented to ED.  Mild paresthesia persisted.  Neurological exam was negative. No unilateral deficits. Speech intact. NIH Stroke scale was 0.  MD&#39;s note states patient was advised that the symptoms could be associated with hyperventilation syndrome or could be early manifestation of Bell&#39;s palsy with the recent vaccine administration (five days earlier).

Pt was reminded to take BP med as prescribed due to patient stating had not yet taken evening med dose.

                                                On 1/8/21 I had pain in my left ear and a feeling of fluid like an earache, also had a pressure type headache behind my eyes and felt fatigued. I stayed home from work and reported it and was told I could return to work on 1/11 (my next scheduled day) by workplace health. I felt fatigue and eye pressure headaches on and off since. I also felt like I was having vision changes. On 1/14/21 I noticed a small, raised, red area at the injection site. Over the weekend it continued to spread over my arm. It is warm and very mild tenderness to palpation but does not itch. I am also feeling tight muscle pain in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.

                                                Severe headache, nausea and cold sensation occurred within a few hours of receiving the vaccine.  Arm discomfort and fatigue quickly followed.  Low grade fever noted approximately 8 hours post vaccine.   I took acetaminophen.  Headache, fatigue, and fever/chills resolved within about 48 hours.  Nausea and arm discomfort persisted for about 5 days.   After approximately 48 hours, I noted vision changes, blurry up-close vision.  This change might have occurred sooner, but it was not until this time that I felt well enough to really read.  The change in vision led me to seek further evaluation in the emergency room on 1/16/2021.

I lost feeling on the left side of my face and my tongue became numb. The symptoms remained for well over five hours until I took two Benadryl.  Then the symptoms subsided.  I have had a terrible reaction to the drug Compazine in the past which resulted in loss of motor control in my face.  While I never lost control of my motor functioning after receiving the vaccine, the loss of feeling in my face was similar to my past reaction to Compazine.

                                                Within first 15 min my throat started to feel like it was closing up. My tongue also felt like it going towards the back of my throat and I was dizzy/lightheaded. It lasted. About 5/7 min. It felt like was easing up so the school nurse told me wait an additional 15 min to be sure I was ok. She also took my blood pressure and said was normal. Dr. a pharmacist brought me orange juice a d said maybe was just low blood sugar. I said it felt similar to when my epidural during last delivery was up too high and my throat closed up and I couldn?t breathe.  About ten min later it began again.  I tried to get up and walk around some and I felt a little better at first but then started to get significantly worse. I felt like I was struggling to breathe and tongue was swollen feeling and stuck to back of mouth as if it was paralyzed.  I say back down and my blood pressure was high (just told bottom number was 106). I was moved to another room to lie down and pharmacist mentioned using epi pen or benedryl shot. I had to sit up and almost passed out. I was having difficulty breathing. Not because of my lungs but my throat and tongue seemed frozen. He decided to give me a 25 mg Benadryl shot but had me drink it. It had a horrible bitter taste and made my throat and tongue numb. At this point it was about 12:30. My administrator called a coworker to drive me home. I decided to leave about 29 min after I had the benedryl.  I could still feel that my throat was somewhat tight but it had improved enough that I didn?t think I was in danger of not being to breathe again. I went home (15 min drive) and by then my throat felt a lot tighter. I took 25 mg more of benedryl and it felt better. About four hours later it became tight again and I took 50 mg of benedryl. Through out all this I had severe pain at site of injection in my left arm, dizziness, nausea, and headache.

This is typical for me when I am starting to fight something off.  I was managing okay until around 1pm when I started to low grade fever at 99.8.  By around 4pm, my body was really starting to ache and I was getting chills.  After the training, I took some Thera Flu, but I couldn?t really move from the couch to the bed because my body was so sore.  My fever fluctuated between high 99?s to low 100?s.  I felt like I got hit by a truck.  I managed to fall asleep around 8:00pm and was able to sleep until 1:00am.  I took more Thera Flu, water, and was able to fall back to sleep at 3:00ish am. 1/23/21:  I woke again at 11:00am and my aching was still there but not nearly as bad as the previous day but now I felt heavy congestion in my head and chest.  I also had sneezing, and a stuffy then runny nose off and on throughout the day.  I was also very, very tired and had no energy to do anything but lay there.  Today is when the diarrhea started 1/24/21:  Body aches at this point are still tolerable but I?m sore.  My arm injection site is bruising and starting to itch and still slightly warm to the touch.  I have sneezing, a dry cough, and an off and on runny nose and diarrhea  1/25/21:  Body aches are mild today, dry cough is here, post nasal drip mucus I am assuming as well.  All I want to do is sleep.  I?m so tired.  No diarrhea today so far but I haven?t had anything to eat yet.

Then my legs started to feel heavy and numb, then my face felt numb and then my arms. I could barely pick something up and I could not stand. Then my jaw started to shake and so did my legs. I went to the ER and they said I was having a shock/panic attack response to the vaccine. On Monday 1/25 I woke up in extreme stomach pain and went back to the ER and they said I needed to have my appendix out. I went to a hospital where they tried to just give me antibiotics, but still had to have my appendix out on Wednesday 1/27.

Upon trying to drink water, she started to feel sick and dry heaved (never vomited) then she said she had problems trying to swallow.  She did not report trouble breathing.  I called 911, they had me ask her a series of questions.  As soon as she said her throat was bothering her again, I administered the EpiPen at 12:10. We also called her emergency contact person.

Saturday 2/20, 24 hours after getting the vaccine my tongue started to swell up/ was splotchy/ had bumps allong the side and my throat was scratchy. My breathing/asthma was also triggered and I increased use of my albuterol.  I took benadryl with minimum results, but symptoms did not get severe enough to go to the ER.   The next day, Sunday 2/21 my tongue was still swollen and my jaw/ face were also sore and had inflammation. This was in addition to the sore arm/joints.

The right side of my face tingled and was a little numb and red; including part of my tongue, my check, and up my temple. Tingling subsided after a few hours. Then about 30 hours after the shot, a few hours after the tingle, the right side of my face got really hot, red, and slowly started to swell. It felt a little numb, including part of my tongue. I took benadryl, went to sleep, and woke up fine. I had a cousin and aunt with similar symptoms after their second moderna shot, I don&#39;t have their specific symptoms, but I do know their faces tingled, one 40 hours later the other a couple hours after the shot.

                                                Approximately two minutes after I received the vaccine I had a strange feeling in my right arm (where I received the injection) that went away after about 30 seconds. About two minutes after that, I developed a bitter taste on my tongue that later spread to the rest of my mouth. Several minutes later, my lips began to tingle and swell, then my mouth (i.e. my soft palette) began to swell as well. About forty minutes after I received the vaccine, I began developing shortness of breath and spiked a fever.  The on-site doctor administered an Epipen and I was transported to the ER. While at the hospital I had a blood drawn, a COVID test, a chest X-ray, and multiple EKGs performed. I was discharged about 2.5 hours later.

                                                Slight swelling of the back of the throat and tongue. I waited 30 minutes and was able to leave to take a Benadryl for the swelling. 15 minutes later I coughed a couple of times and then felt my throat constrict and had a hard time swallowing. My breathing became labored so I used my emergency inhaler and while trying to use my inhaler I started coughing and could not stop. Hard coughing. I work at a school that has a nurse on site and she helped the front office stabilize me after 30 minutes of coughing and not being able to swallow well. My pulse ox got down to 90 with a pulse of 122. I had a rash covering my throat and chest. I did take a Benadryl as well. An ambulance was called but by the time they got there the coughing was slowing down and my throat was opening back up. I was sent home to rest.

I?m now allergic to soy, yeast, wheat, coffee, casein (dairy) peanuts, green beans/ legumes, eggs, onion and celery. I?ve had a huge rash that broke out on my left arm that started at the spot where I received the injection.  Now I?ve been experiencing my mouth and tongue swelling to the point that my throat has closed up. I?ve been hospitalized as air wasn?t going through my body. I had to inject an Epi-pen in my leg, and be taken to the hospital. I?m currently on high dosage prednisone, Benadryl and several other meds to address the swelling in my tongue that happens daily. I am desperate to find out if there is anyway to stabilize anything that vaccine had in it to see if this condition will get better.

                                                On 2/25/21 I received my first Moderna vaccine.  Later that day, I started to experience some brain fog and fatigue. this resolved itself after approximately 4 hours. On  3/3/21 I took my dose of Humira that I use for Crohn&#39;s Disease and about 3 hours later experienced extreme fatigue. I have been on Humira for 3.5 years and I have never experienced a reaction to the Humira like this. On 3/4/21, the next day after taking my Humira, I once again experienced extreme fatigue, a very bad headache and horrible brain fog to the point where the things I was reading on my computer and things people were saying to me was not making sense. I was also very nauseated and had severe diarrhea. I was tested for Covid just to be sure and I was negative. I went home and fell asleep and slept for 6 hours. I did feel better upon waking up.  Approximately one week later I experienced a sever migraine with visual disturbances.  On 3/15/21 I began having  a Crohn&#39;s flare. I had been in remission for 3.5 years with my last colonoscopy in October of 2019 showing  this and that my Crohn&#39;s ulcers had improved. I went to the ER on 3/16/21 in severe pain, was found to be in a flare with inflammation and swelling in my small intestine and a partial blockage. I was admitted to the hospital for 2 days where I received IV steroids and fluids. I was sent home on oral prednisone and now have to add additional medication to my Humira regimen for my Crohn&#39;s.  I am sure that some will say that none of this is related to the Moderna vaccine I received, but I have had no issues with my Crohn&#39;s in 3.5 years until I had this vaccine. All of my issues this past month coincide with receiving the vaccine and I have never had any side effects whatsoever from the Humira. In fact, it&#39;s always made me feel better when I&#39;ve been due to take it, so I know that my symptoms are not from the Humira. I cannot say for sure if the vaccine caused my issues, however, it&#39;s pretty coincidental that I was feeling good and otherwise healthy until I had this vaccine.

                                                A little over 24 hours post vaccination (09JAN2021), I started to experience some tongue numbness/tingling along the lateral edges and the tip of my tongue.  This is ongoing as of time of this report.  This is not interfering with function, but it is a new symptom that I did not have prior to receiving my vaccination.  As additional medical history in the last 30 days, I had dental work done for a broken filling on 21DEC2020 (multiple numbing injections during this visit - two molars grounded down to prepare for placement of two crowns of left lower molars).   2 crowns placed on 06JAN2021 (1 numbing injection at this visit). Additionally, I also started with symptoms of inner ear infection on 03JAN2021, was evaluated by medical provider on 05JAN2021 and diagnosed with suspected inner ear infection, for which I am currently taking doxycycline and sudafed for.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

I began taking Benedryl and continued to take Benedryl every 4-6 hours over approximately the next 48 hours. Also, I originally had no injection site reaction, however, on Jan 9th, my right arm began to itch. Upon assessment, I noted a 1.5&#34; diameter red, warm area where the vaccine had been administered. This lasted for three days, and now, January 12th it no longer itches, and looks more like a bullseye that is approximately 2.5&#34; in diameter around where the redness was. I have also noticed that since the vaccine I feel cloudy or like I have a constant mild headache.

                                                About 8 minutes into my 15 minute observation time after receiving my first COVID vaccine, my tongue started tingling.  The observation nurse gave be a Benadryl and water.  within the next minutes my whole body started tingling, I felt nauseas, and felt like I was going to pass out. The nurse laid me on the ground.  I asked her to take my BP and pulse.  For me it was high 145/98.  My pulse was also reported t be high.  I was able to swallow and breath.  I continued to have waves up and down my whole body of tingling, nasusea and cold sweats.  The nurse called my husband to come.  I was able to sit up after about 20 minutes.  The waves of feeling sick continued for about an hour.  After having some food and drink about 2 hours later I was able to drive home.  I was exhausted, nauseous, and had a headache the next 2 days.  I am concerned to get my second vaccine.

Patient experienced a metallic taste in her mouth, nausea, headache (slight), slight shaking, and dizziness. She also described a warm, tingly feeling on the side of her neck. She was seated and monitored by pharmacist on duty for at least 30 mins before deciding that she was ok to leave. She decided that she wanted to walk out herself. Her daughter did come to pick her up so she would not have to drive herself. She was instructed to go to the ER if symptoms worsened. I will check back with patient on her condition before end of business today.

                                                Had the injection Friday evening. Very quickly had my heart rise and felt shaky (like when you take an inhaler). Heart rate stayed up for about 30 min, shaky for about another 1 and half.  but left factily after 15 minutes, as I was shaky, but ok.  About 20 min after shot, the tip of my tongue and lips got tingly/numbish. Not swollen, just tingly.  (They were very slightly the same way the next day). I went home and contacted  hotline. She suggested I call a dr. I called a dr who told me to take a benadryl.  I ate some food and took the benadryl. I fell asleep and slept for 14 hours (definitely not normal). That next day (Saturday) I had a headache, upset stomach, lowgrade fever (below 99.9) and pretty good pain in the injection arm. Stomach was settled by that evening, headache was gone Sunday. Off and on low grade fever (highest was 100.3) still ongoing (Tues 3/2, but highest today is 99.1))

                                                Starting on Sunday Feb 28th I was very fatigued. I woke up on Monday after sleeping more than 12 hours with my head feeling tight and hot. My eyelids were burning, the skin around my neck felt irritated and my lymph nodes in my neck were swollen. The burning in my eyelids and neck pain went away by Monday evening. However on Tuesday I woke up with a visible rash on my neck. In the last few days it has stayed even though I have applied cortisone and neosporin on it. It is now warm to the touch and itchy. I also have a rash on my eyelids and my cheek which are hard to see in pictures because of my skin tone. I called my Primary for a virtual consult when I woke up this morning Saturday March 6 because I am feeling itchy all over especially on my back. Additionally, the skin of my elbows and knees (in the joint crease area) are now super warm like my eyelids were before the rash appeared. I also have neck pain again which started yesterday (March 5th) afternoon. It is not a muscular pain. It starts at the base of neck and radiates up to the crown of my head. It has not gone away with either Tylenol or Advil. My chest is also tight--not my lungs but my chest itself.

                                                Felt a burning sensation in my hands right after getting the shot.  Went home,  took 2  Aleve and iced my arm for 5 minutes at a time on and off about 4 times.  Hours later,  about 8 pm I was laying down on the couch on my left side for at least 20 minutes.  When I was getting up my upper left arm was very numb and I had a strange sensation on my left side like my blood had pooled over there but it was very numb in the area.  I never have felt anything like that.  The sensation did go away over the course of a few minutes.  Soon after I was having shooting pain in my hands.  It felt like arthritis pain.  This did not last too long but came back here and there.  My lower back started hurting a little bit out of nowhere.  And then when I went to bed I started having random body aches all over.  Like brief shooting pain in different parts of my body.  I did have some dryness, weird sensation in my throat at times. The body aches kept me up until 2 or 3 am.  It was resolved by the time I woke.  I never felt that I had a temperature.  And I was not sick prior so I felt it was a cause and effect from the vaccine.  I took 2 Aleve and I went to work.  Temperature checked at work and I was 97.1,  normal.  Wore a mask all day,  social distanced at work and I had mentioned to my manager upon arrival that I had symptoms/reaction? after my shot.  I did still have some residual,  arthritis type pain in my hands during the day and more so when I got home.  I also felt fatigued when I got home from work but I was half awake most of the night before due to the body aches.  Felt pretty good,  normal on the second day after the vaccine.

                                                I had a swelling and my arm got hot at injection site ( small allergic reaction- a red line). It felt like when I used to get allergy shots for cats.  It got better by that Wednesday  (01/13/2021). I had taken a Benadryl that date for my itchy nose and dry eyes (I thought it was seasonal allergies.) Today one week and a day after injection my arm swelled up again and is hot . A large red bump appears at the injection site.   Again it feels like when I used to get my allergy shots.  My  throat feels itchy as well, breathing is normal.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after injection I became itchy; the itchiness covered my body from the top of my head to just above my knees. About 5 minutes after that my face became tingly and my breathing became shallow. At this time my blood pressure, pulse ox and pulse were taken. They were all normal, however my breathing was still labored. I used my rescue inhaler, was given a double dose of allergy medicine and 800mg of ibuprofen. Within a couple of minutes my breathing had returned to normal.  Approximately 20 hours after injection I suffered from a headache that lasted around 6 hours. I also became very tired; the day of the injection I slept 10 hours and the following day I slept 12 hours. On both occasions I woke up to an alarm, so I have no idea how long I would have slept on my own accord.  Final thing to note which may not be related, but merely a coincidence: since receiving the vaccine, I have been unusually thirsty.

                                                at 15 mins post injection started to get extremely hot from Right side to left. Then like half of my body was cut head to toe in half and the left side of my body went numb and tingly. I could barely move my extremeties. Tounge began to burn like a 9volt battery was being held on it. I was taken to the ER and was told I had a rash on my chest neck and chin. I was treated with Epi IM, Benedryl, famotdine, then had epi again because my tounge felt fat and like a 9volt battery again. Epi went IV second does and had extreme pain with that. Had IV tylenol . Along with IV fluids. For the next 5 days I have had pain in my right harm , shoulder , neck into my head to the tip of my nose. The first 4 days were so bad that I could barely move and would get nauseated and throw up if I moved just right. each day the pains in my right arm,shoulder, neck and head did get better by about 25 percent each day. You could feel it getting better with each day I woke up.  I was also having ear pain that seemed to be worse on 1/19/21. A PA checked my ears and said they were clear.Today, 1/22/21 is the first day I have been able to turn my head without being so sore and feeling nauseated. I was also very fatigued until today, 1/22/21. My hips and lower body are sore today and upper body seems to be less sore by 75%. I still am numb at times in my feet and fingers but can turn my head a lot better today.

On 1/21/2021 I went to visit the optometrist and was immediatley referred to the  opthamologist for a same day appointment. I was told it looked like a herpetic keratis (HSV 1 virus) by both physicians. I have a left corneal transplant. I have never had an HSV virus affect my eye in the past. The last fever blister I had was &gt; 5 years ago.  Treated with maxitrol qid, Acyclovir five times a day, Cyclogel bid. Severe light sensitivity resolved after about 24 hours.  On f/u appointment on 1/26/2021 he said that the herpatic lesion was looking better. Eye pain resolved. I am continuing medication.

She had a nurse check her blood pressure and it was 101/65 and her heart rate was 138 bpm.  She felt presyncopal so she went to the ED for evaluation.  By the time she got to the ED, she felt her throat was scratchy, and when she would lie down flat she felt her throat was occluding.  She notes that she is s/p tonsillectomy in 12-2020, and considered whether that was playing a role in her symptoms, but she had not had any of those throat symptoms for 1 week prior to getting her COVID-19 vaccine.  In the ED, she was given IV medications and IV fluids.  ENT was consulted.  Her symptoms got better with medications, she is still experiencing some throat dryness but otherwise is feeling back to her usual self.  She never had any rash, flushing, itching.  She had a little tenderness at the injection site only.  She never had any difficulty breathing, lip/eye/tongue swelling, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, vomiting/diarrhea/abdominal pain.  She did have nausea when she felt vertigo.

I wear an Apple Watch and notice my heart rate was steadily climbing. I asked the exit secretaries to be seen by a nurse and as they were getting a nurse my heart rate reached 169 and I was feeling faint and beginning to shake. When the nurse came she noticed how white my hands were and my breathing was becoming labored. The nurse called a code white and an ICU nurse and respiratory specialist arrived to assess me. I thought I would pass out and they had me lay on my back with legs up. They tested my blood sugar and were assessing my vitals. My breathing was fast but I was still able to breathe. My heart rate started to slow down but remained somewhat high. they helped me into a wheelchair and escorted me to the emergency department. I was assessed for cardiac concerns and labs were taken. After a couple of hours in the ED the dizziness started to subside but I had excessive thirst and dry mouth and slightly swollen tongue. I had feeling of butterflies in my stomach off an on. My heart rate stabilized and I was cleared to go home after four hours.

                                                After about 5 mins after the shot, I started feeling &#34;foggy&#34; with my vision and mental clarity. After about 20 minutes, I grabbed my water bottle and both arms felt weak when I lifted them and they felt like they were floating. I had a sudden urge to cry when this happened that lasted for 30 seconds.  I was not anxious or nervous to take the vaccine but my body may have overreacted to the sensation of my arms but it didn&#39;t feel like a panic attack that I had a few in my earlier 20s after the birth of my child and undiagnosed thyroid disorder.

                                                Within 5 minutes after shot my lips were feeling tingly. at 15 minutes out a co-worker sat by me and I told her about my lips and she commented that I had a large red mark/rash on my neck. I went to the nurse and she asked if I was nervous - which I was. She told me that I should take a Benadryl. I took a single Benadryl.  I went home and was still feeling the tingling sensation and had the rash which had spread onto my chest.  I took another Benadryl about one hour after the initial shot. This reduced the rash and tingling sensation. as it wore off about 4.5 hours later the rash, tingling lips and facial swelling started to appear. I took two more Benadryl and called the on call doctor at my physicians office.  He advised me to continue taking Benadryl until 48 hours after the vaccine, I did this every 4-5 hours including waking during the night to keep up on it. I was also taking Advil at this point to try to help with the swelling and a dull headache that had set in. I should note that I have never had any facial injections or anything like unto it. For 40 hours post vaccine I did this. After 48  hours the symptoms seemed to go away. I did start feeling a metallic taste in my mouth that night and the following night so I took a single Benadryl at bedtime those nights and that seemed to resolve it. I have had a slight cough and congestion on days 3-6 when I woke up in the morning, but that would resolve itself within an hour of being up. The doctor on call that I spoke with the first night did advise me to still get the second dose, but to take some Benadryl ahead of time and to make sure that the clinic has a current EpiPen on site.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA:  Around 4pm, began having normal side effects of fatigue, headache. That night at 12:30am, woke up with temp (99.9) and had chills. Was shaking so badly from them, i was having uncontrollable hand tremors and couldn&#39;t use my finger to type on my phone. Was awake for the rest of the night. In the morning had a 101 , also had loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, nausea, headache, weakness.  But the adverse event I&#39;m reporting is blurred vision. I think it began around 12pm on Wed, so almost 24 hours the shot. It was primarily my left eye. There was also a great deal of pressure from behind the eye. It was difficult to read. After about 2-3 hours it passed. It returned briefly again in the evening, although more mild. Today (2/4/21) when I woke up, my vision is fine and the pressure behind the eye is gone.

                                                I got after the first dose what some people are to experience after their second dose.  This could be because I had Covid in November and probably have circulating antibodies already.  My right arm had 10/10 pain starting around midnight waking me up and was persistent with any movement which extended up into my neck and down to my elbow area.  Ibuprofen and tylenol did not help with the pain. Currently on post-vaccine day 3 I still am unable to get full ROM to my right arm due to pain but it is better than yesterday.  Other symptoms I had was the fevers, chills, headache, extreme hypersensitivity to my skin, and bone pain with movement especially to my hips and back with walking which seems to be subsiding.  whole body aches/pain which seems to be subsiding as well.  What I don&#39;t see mentioned in a lot of the expected side effects is TINNITUS.  I am experiencing moderate tinnitus.  I have experienced this previously in my 20&#39;s when taking a full dose of aspirin and I avoid aspirin products because of that.  I did not see anywhere that there is aspirin products in these injections.  It has not subsided yet at this time and I am wanting to report this.  Not sure if others are experiencing this as well.

                                                The first shot I received on December 28th.  I have fatigue and a headache for about three days and my arm did hurt for close to 2 1/2 weeks,  the second week it was red, 3 inches in diameter, raised, also it itched very badly for 4-5 days.                I received the second maderna vaccine on 1/28/21 about 5:45 pm. I had noted about 8 pm mild burning to the lower part of my legs and bottom of my feet that evening.  Later I started to have mild nausea about 9 pm, but it resolved, and I went to bed.  I woke up about 3:11 with diarrhea and my body and mainly &#34;my skin&#34; started to hurt, as if someone was taking a wire brush to my legs, and slowly pulling out each hair, but at one time. After another hour or so, I started to have severe chills with increased nausea and more severe severe body/bone/joint pains. I took Tylenol at this time. I noted that the bottom of my ribs or rib cage hurt with breathing, also I had upper abdominal pain, severe lower back pain and a headache. The next morning I stayed in bed all day and took a few baths, I had multiple episodes of diarrhea. I was nauseated, but no vomiting.  I still had chills, bodily shaking, fatigue, muscle and joint pain.  I tried to sleep off and on through the day.  That evening I did have a temperature of 101.4 with using Tylenol and Motrin.  It did come down later that evening, but I still had severe pain of my body and my skin hurt, even the hair on my head, during the night about 2:45 am I took a bath and that did help with my body.  on Saturday evening I was able to start getting up and moving around, but a severe decreased appetite. I&#39;ve noted a drastic change in taste since having the vaccine and have lost 9 lbs in the past week.  I am able to taste, but everything has a different taste.  I have had two covid tests PCR&#39;s in order to return to work.  I also have had the continued bilateral leg burning from the calves to the bottom of my feet.  The sensation is if you are cold outside and come back in and run your hands or feet under warm water to warm them up and that pain you feel when they warm up is how they feel, but on a milder level than that pain.  I also have had post nasal drip that has started in past 5 days and while at work in the ER on Tuesday I had a PA look at my ears and I had a large amount of fluid behind both ears.  I had a zpack that I had at the pharmacy that I had refilled and have taken that for the past four days with some relief.  I still feel fluid in my ears, but mildly better.  The headache and fatigue is getting better each day.  My appetite is still very diminished as well as how things taste in my mouth, it is way different than anything I have ever experienced before.  I also had an Issue on Monday 2/1/21 when I was working, I felt in my brain, as if it was just not as sharp, cloudy. I had an issue with typing on my right hand for a few hours (upper row on rt side) that has since resolved, but it was a truly &#34;off&#34; day.  It has taken me this entire week to start to feel even a bit more back to human.  So what remains- the bilateral leg to bottom of feet weird burning sensation, decreased appetite,  taste alterations, post nasal congestion with bilateral fluid in ears, shortness of breath with activity, mild burning in lungs with activity (working out/running in the cold weather).           this was just a side note that was copied to the bottom.       I was unable to touch my arm right arm due to swelling and pain for about three day, which I know is to be expected and actually wasn&#39;t as sore as long as the first shot.  I did take a few doses of Motrin 800mg but tried to stay with Tylenol and Zofran, and hydrate.              I noted that warm baths helped the most and the use of a heating pad on my lower back and an ice pack on and off my head for the headaches.   Thank you

But worst is inability to lift left arm, severe left arm pain, even joint pain in left wrist. Could barely lift L arm on day 2 after (Sunday) and again unable to lift it day 3 after (Monday).  First dose, I had arm pain, trouble lifting it 1 day, pain for a week and mild soreness for the whole month. Pre-existing joint pains from autoimmune were worse for a week, but this second dose - it only seems to be vaccine side, including left jaw, left eye pain, left collarbone pain near a previously affected injury.

They said that I was getting red and flushed. All within a minute. They said my eyelids were starting to swell - upper and lower eye. They had me leave with an ambulance to go to ER. In the ambulance, they started an IV and they gave me Benadryl through IV and they took my blood pressure - it was elevated. I started feeling better. I could breathe. It took 10 minutes to get hospital. The swelling in my face went down. At ER I felt fine. I asked the paramedics ambulance to drive me home but they said that I would just discharged after we arrived. They gave me Pepsid and something else - antihistamine at ER. I had gotten off medication for the immunologist visit which was already scheduled prior to vaccine - but after the vaccine she just got me on higher doses of the medications. February 11th, second dose of vaccine was taken.

When I woke up the next morning, the site was raised and swollen more than the night before. It had the appearance of cellulitis. It was still hot to the touch. I marked the edges of the rash and it progressively got bigger over the course of 48 hours. I still have a mark on my arm where the rash was. I also had severe jaw and neck pain. I felt like my wisdom teeth were pulled with no lidocaine.  I has boughts of nausea and was very tired. I tried to put ice on the area of my arm that was swollen, but it did not help.

                                                As a prophylactic measure after my reaction to the 1st dose. I took 50mg of IM Benadryl prior to receiving the vaccine. . My vaccine appointment was for 9:40AM. I waited 30min at the vaccine site and felt ok so I went home. Got home around 10:30 and laid down. Felt drowsy because of the Benadryl. I woke up around noon feeling my lips &#34;buzzing&#34; and my tongue numb. Called my PCP who sent a RX for another IM Benadryl 50mg. I was able to take it around 3:30PM and that made the feeling on my tongue and lips go away. Around 9PM I started feeling chills, general malaise. And it went on through the night. Next day I felt really fatigued and slept most of the day. I went to work that night and it was a struggle. Took a Tylenol during my shift and next day once again slept throughout the day. At night I was feeling much better.

                                                On my way back to home I looked at the clock it is 10:38AM when I saw my face really flushed in the mirror and started feeling that I could not feel tongue, inside the mouth was also numb and tingling, my gums and tongue and cheeks and lips. Got home and went to bed  around 11AM and woke up at 2PM feeling worse the numbness now was going down my throat, like it was swelling. Took 25 mg of Benadryl and called my PCP who advise to go to the ER. At the ER they did a CBC  and a CMC or a CMB not sure. They also gave me 15mg of IV Benadryl and 8 mg of IV Decadron. About 15 min after receiving the IV meds at the ER I started feeling relief.  Around 8PM I was released to go home.  No symptoms next day.

                                                Slight nausea and about 2:00 am -woke up with an excruciating headache - worse when I was lying down. Sensitivity to lights. Fatigue throughout the day as well. I called clinic at 8:00 am (where I work, too) - spoke with a nurse through triage. They told me to rest and that I should stay on schedule for my second dose (didn&#39;t think it was from vaccine). Told me I could take 600 mg Ibuprofen about noon that day and finally started getting relief from headache. I did take another Ibuprofen when I went to bed. On the 13th,I was back to 100%. I don&#39;t usually get migraines - it was really weird because I felt worse when I was lying down.

From the time of injection until current, chills, intermittent low grade fever, headache and body aches different from my normal aches. Worse GI issues, memory issues worse than normal, feeling of disorientation at times, little difficulty catching my breath (only used rescue inhaler once). I felt a bit better about a week and a half post injection. But, then, started to feel worse, including vaccinated arm feeling heavy and sore again - February 27, 2021 - noticed reddish/ pink abnormal circle around injection site this is new, delayed, overall worse malaise, I felt a general feeling of yuck. I know it?s not a great descriptor, but, it kind of fits. Basically, lupusy, but worse.

                                                2am woke up with severe chills and a severe migraine. At 10am severe migraine progressed to skin on scalp feeling like it was pulled too tight. From there I began to feel an internal tremor in my head, almost like if you ran a jack hammer all day and then stopped, that shaky, off-kilter feeling.  I used the bathroom that morning and had massive diarrhea, experience a vaso/syncope episode and passed out.  All week I felt like this and experienced nausea, dizziness, heart palpitations, severe migraine, internal tremor, severe anxiety and severe thirst.  By Friday, 2/26/21, it got so bad and my blood pressure dropped to 112/50, that I was taken via ambulance to the ER.  They gave me IV fluids, ran labs, EKG, etc.  Blood pressure went up to 137/91.  Released to rehab at home.  2nd ER visit to Hospital on Sunday where they repeated labs, EKG, gave me fluids and treated symptoms. Both trips I was labeled Tachy.

                                                At 3pm, I started to have a small allergic reaction.  Symptoms started with sweaty palms, my tongue  felt strange, my body felt weird particularly from my  knees to my toes and I was easily winded moving around.  Symptoms slowly progressed until I went to the dr and was prescribed prednisone and benedryl.

Next day, sore arm and still have a strange feeling in my tongue and lips.  Teeth feel a little numb or swollen.  Feels like I have lost some of my sense of taste on my tongue.

Around 10:30 am I began feeling extremely flushed (no fever although my temperature was elevated for my normal temp - usually 97.6 and it was 98.7) and nauseated. My whole body started to ache around 11 am and I had a hard time staying awake. When I left work around 4:00 pm I went home and slept for the rest of the day and until 11:30 pm that night. I got up and had a snack and then went back to bed. Slept all day January 16th due to a horrible headache and fatigue. Woke up feeling a bit better Sunday although I still had a headache and some fatigue. Monday I was doing better. Later in the day on Monday, January 18th my right eye started hurting and feeling irritated. Then on Tuesday, it started getting a little pink. On Friday I had a puffy red eye. I saw a doctor online on Saturday, January 23rd and I was given eye drops for conjunctivitis.

The redness And swelling decreased slowly but continued for about five or six days. As the redness went down itchiness increased. By the seventh or eighth day there?s no longer any sign of redness or symptoms. On the morning of January 19 the redness at the vaccination site returned and by the evening redness warmth and swelling had increased. After a telehealth visit I was advised to take Benadryl that night which I did. The following morning after a cup of coffee which I have ervery day, I had the onset of intermittent palms and soles of my feet sweating and later in the morning had jaw/mandible and tongue tingling.  This tingling lasted about 10 to 15 minutes. On January 21 the redness and swelling started to go down and in the evening I had three hives appear, one at a time on my back and buttock. They only lasted a short period of time and we?re gone by the time I went to sleep. On January 22 I had one more short episode of tingling of the mandible which lasted a short period of time . Over the next several days the redness and swelling went down and as that happened the itchiness returned and is still mildly present today January 24. There is no longer any redness or swelling though

                                                About 30 min after I received the vaccine in my left arm I began to have swelling on the left side of my mouth and tingling throughout my left arm. Took Claritin and eventually the swelling and tingling went away within an hour -hour and a half. That following Tuesday night around 7pm I had the swelling in my lip on the left side again and throughout my chin. This time it took longer after Claritin I felt it still even as I went to bed around 9. When I woke the next morning at 5:30 the swelling was down but the pressure in my chin was still present but did go away completely through the morning.

Pt admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation secondary to angioedema from Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. Pt presented with a chief complaint of tongue and facial swelling approximately 10 minutes after receiving first dose of the vaccination. She did not respond to Benadryl or IM epinephrine. She was admitted to ICU and intubated. She was started on IVsteroids, famotidine and diphenhydramine. Swelling gradually improved and she was successfully extubated.  Her hospital course was complicated by steroid-induced hyperglycemia requiring insulin.

The headache got more and more extreme The next morning people at work noticed I was slurring my words. Felt like crap full body aches and extremely tired.

My throat did not close, but it clenched or got tight and my tongue seemed to tense.  Before I had time to think about that, I had a surge of adrenaline which left me a bit startled.  The tongue and throat tightening happened without an adrenaline surge approximately 4 more times.  I lost feeling in my left arm and felt lightheaded.  This lasted about 30 minutes, after which I felt fine.  I experienced sharp stabbing pains in hands, feet, pelvis and fingers, which are still present 48 hours later.  At 24 hours post-vaccine, I felt chills and developed muscle aches and a low fever, which are still present at 48 hours post-vaccine.

                                                Lip swelling, numbness and slight discomfort. I took diphenhydramine 25mg with no effect. No other signs or symptoms of allergic reaction (no hives/rash, no swelling in any other areas). At the time of this reporting , the swelling has improved  a lot.  I read a possible correlation with lip filler recipients. I did receive lip filler approximately 1 to 1.5yrs ago.

But I noticed the next day that I had better control of my facial muscles on the left side. The night of the shot, I also felt some numbness/mild pain around my left ear and on the tip of my nose and on my cheek and a new sensation (numbness) on the left side of my brain. Also that night though, I sang a short song and had a loss of control of the tune--like my voice was really changing (unusual). Now, I feel some barely perceptible numbness on that same side of my face sometimes but really feel fully capable of everything and like this doesn&#39;t really matter except to let others know that it can happen.  I am very happy to be vaccinated and want the second shot if it&#39;s okay!!!

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 20 Jan 2021 at 18:00, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection, the patient began to have tongue swelling. She was given diphenhydramine and epinephrine by epi pen. She went to the emergency room where she displayed symptoms including a fast heart rate, wheezing, and shortness of breath with an angioedema or anaphylaxis like appearance. She was given more epinephrine, famotidine, scheduled diphenhydramine at 50 QAs intravenously (IV), IV steroids, was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She was on the ventilator for approximately 18-20 hours following admission. She eventually responded to a high dose of dexamethasone. She was also given duonebs for her shortness of breath, regular sedation for the ventilator, and a dose of ketorolac. Consent was given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events were unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred approximately 10 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration.

                                                Mild dizziness started within 5 minutes. Within 20 minutes my tongue started to swell, but only the front to middle part, not the back part. I was still able to breathe. After 25 minutes, I was unable to stand and nearly passed out twice trying to get to some place safe.  I could not verbally communicate and was lacked strength to move. I started drinking as many fluids as possible with the assistance of family. Symptoms began to subside after 3 hrs. After 4 hrs, I regained strength and was not dizzy if I stayed in place. I continued to push fluids and rested. I needed to be careful not to drink anything too cold as i would develop the chills. The next day, there was no dizziness but I was very groggy. I continued to push fluids. I would develop a headache if I did not drink at 16 oz every hour. The following day, I was still groggy, but was functional and felt okay to drive.

                                                My left arm, where I received the shot, began hurting after a few hours. Approximately 12 hours after receiving the shot, fatigue began. Approximately two hours later, I was unable to walk, I collapsed on the floor, my heart was racing, I was sweating, my entire body went numb, and there was ringing and static in my ears. After about 20 minutes on the floor, I got back into bed. My fingers and hands wanted to curl up and not open and that lasted throughout the night. My arms and legs stayed numb all night long.  At around 24 hours post vaccine, the numbness started to subside, I could open my fingers and hands, and regular flu symptoms were present (fatigue, body aches, low grade fever). I could not work the day after receiving the shot. I slept all day. I was not able to drive until around 5PM the day after receiving the shot. The second night and throughout the following day (so 36-48&#43; hours post shot), I had cold sweats. It is now 3 days later and I still feel terrible. I am worried about getting the second Moderna shot.

                                                After taking the shot I had a very mild metallic taste in my tongue.   After about 45 minutes later the metallic taste became much stronger.  My lips felt like they were drying out, my tongue felt like it was swelling and drying out, and it felt difficult to swallow.  The strong sensation only lasted a couple of minutes.  It is now 7:48 PM and I still have a &#34;very mild&#34; case where my lips feel they are either itchy or mildly burning and my tongue still feels weird and has a very mild metallic taste.  I did not have any issues with tasting anything.  I also have a very mild headache.

                                                I had Covid-19 in December 2020. On the following day of my first vaccine, in the middle of the night, I experienced chills, body aches. At 7am the next day I woke up feeling light headed and passed out. When I woke up I had thrown up on myself and started to hear a whooshing sound in my ears and I went back to bed. At 9am my symptoms started all over again. I live with my house maid and since I did not look well, she took me to urgent care. My BP had dropped and I was super dizzy. I got an IV drip for an hour, anti-nausea medication. My blood was also drawn and found to have underlying anemia. My urine test was negative. The pulse oximetry was fine and by the next day I slowly started to feel better.

Day 2: residual headache (50%), tiredness, weakness, sweating if doing things, residual knee joint pain, sense of smell/taste returned and heightened. Day 3: residual headache (25%), still not 100%, residual knee joint pain. Day 4 (today):  residual knee joint pain (comes and goes). I realize that these are not symptoms of an allergic reaction, but severe side effects.

Upon waking the next day(1/5/21) , I felt like I had a migraine on the left side of my face.  Head, ear, and jaw on the left side was painful.  Used  Aleve . The pain was still present, although a little less intense the following day (1/6/21). Arm is also sore but much more manageable than the head pain.

Pt. evaluated by their in house medical team who administered a Benadryl injection to the right arm, unknown dosage. The pt. told me the nurse on staff measured her SPO2 at 86% and wanted to call 911 for transport to the ER. Pt. reports she refused and left work to come to the urgent care clinic where I evaluated her. She is concerned that she could be having a panic attack vs. allergic reaction. Her itching arm and metallic taste has resolved but she feels chest pains on the left side of her chest and her left arm feels heavy.

No initial side effect.s By the evening of 1/18/21 started to develop arm soreness at injection site and body aches. By the morning of 1/18/21 body aches worsened and then developed under eye swelling. No redness, just swelling and soreness. 5-6 months ago I was treated with Juvederm Volbella Filler for tear troughs under the eyes. I have read that there have been reported cases of post vaccine swelling in people treated with fillers. My filler treatment for the past 5 months has been perfect. Now 12-16 hours post 2nd COVID vaccine, I developed under eye swelling. I took Benadryl, Claritin and now starting a Medrol Dose pack.

                                                The day I received my vaccine, I was also exposed to Covid. I ended up developing  Covid Symptoms on 1-30-21, on that same day my bottom lip began swelling.  The first day it was just the left side of my bottom lip. This lasted about three hours. The next day the right side of my bottom lip began swelling and very itchy. I took an antihistamine, swelling went down in a little over an hour, itching continued for a couple more hours. The doctor informed me that they are not sure if it is a reaction to the vaccine, covid, or a combination of both. They told me to report the reaction on this website.

                                                Within 40 minutes my arm started to ache badly.  About 15 minutes after that while I was driving my head started to feel strange - almost lightheaded.  Within a couple of minutes my eyes involuntarily went to the left and the right and then my vision went black (this all happened in a matter of seconds).  I stopped at a store and felt light headed and confused/brain fog.  That continued at home for around 2 hours.  The pain in my arm continued to get worse.   I woke up several times throughout the night with pain in specific sites.  Today I was unable to go to work because of the full body muscular and joint pain, muscular weakness, headache, pain behind the eyes, and feel like I have fluid in my head (kind of like when you have a cold).   I had a significant reaction after the first dose as well (1/5/21 Moderna Lot 026L20A) but it was completely different - mainly arm pain, fever, chills, extreme fatigue, and what feels like fluid retention.  I gained 9 pounds without changing anything diet/exercise following the injection. On day 10 a large red welt appeared on my arm at the site of the injection.  On 2/1 my Endocrinologist sent me for lab work and urinalysis.  Those results are not back.   I likely would not have reported any of this if it wasn?t for the visual occurrence with the mental confusion and lightheadedness. I have never experienced anything like that in my life.

Approximately 12 hours after injection, noticed overall feeling of overwhelming fatigue, body aches and painful injection site. Resolved by 48 hours.  Moderate headache began about 18 hours after injection and lasted intermittently for 36 hours. Advil 400mg and Tylenol 500mg administered for all aches and pains every 6-8 hours for 48 hours.  Fatigue lasted 4 to 5 days post injection. Unsure if related, 2 days after 2nd dose experienced episode of dizziness, feeling ill and light-headed which lasted for an hour. Also happened 3 days after 2nd dose, but lasted only 30 minutes.

                                                Patient waited approximately 20 minutes after receiving vaccine as is standard. Patient began to drive home when she started to notice tingling in her lips, feeling flushed, and then as though her throat was closing. She contacted 911 and they responded road side.  Patient was initially being monitored only, then her BP dropped. Decision was made to transport patient to ED. En route she received epinephrine and was placed on O2 by way of non-rebreather mask.  Upon arrival to the ED patient continued to be dyspneic. She was given solumedrol, benadryl, Pepcid, and mag. Patient was stabilized and no additional epi was required.  Patient was admitted to hospital in observation status.  She was stable overnight. She did have one episode of itching and nausea, she was given diphenhydramine and Zofran and these symptoms resolved. Patient was monitored until around 1PM the day after event and was released to home in stable condition.

                                                Within about 45 minutes of receiving the vaccine I started getting mild hives spreading around the injection site and across my belly. I had mild wheezing and feeling of loose fluid in my brachial area of my chest. Now at 24 hr out, hives are head to toe, and I took diphenhydramine at bedtime in addition to my loratadine each AM.  I&#39;ve used my inhaler twice to see if that helped - it doesn&#39;t, so it&#39;s not a regular asthma attack.  Today I have intermittently dealt with mild sweats, moderate chills, mild nausea, shakes (might be the inhaler as that sometimes makes me shake), headache fluxing between mild to moderate, eyes watering and lids swollen slightly with hives, injection site soreness, swelling about the diameter of a softball (interfering with ROM on left arm - I am an interpreter, so this interfered with work a lot today!), left arm from shoulder to elbow is hot to the touch, and I have had mild disconnects with my ability to focus/breaks in completing thoughts today.    I am keeping my EpiPens close, just in case.  I live 3 miles to the nearest ER, and someone is here with me just in case I need to go.

We contacted pharmacy I received the vaccine from and they said to go the fire station across the street.  The symptoms lasted for approx 3 minutes and then subsided.  We went to the fire station and they took vitals and released me, advising me to take Benadryl and go to an urgent care if it came back.  As we were driving home again, I experienced the same thing again.  (Approx 1 hr 25 min after vaccine).  It lasted for 2-3 minutes and then subsided again.  I had lingering numbness of my lower jaw and tip of tongue.  I took 2 Benadryl pills and it relieved all the symptoms.  I slept for 11 hrs.  Upon waking, the numbness of the tongue has persisted.

During the night, I experienced chills and excessive sweating.    The next day (02/26/21), I experienced body aches, joint aches (especially in my fingers), headache, chills, and a fever (highest 101.7).  Drank lots of fluids and took 400 mg of Tylenol every 6 hours.  Noticed around noon that I my taste buds were off, meaning I had a loss of taste even when consuming salty food.  Fever rose to 101.7 and experiences chills and excessive sweating during the night.    Today (02/27/21), I woke up with no fever and little body aches.  Joint pains and headache are gone.  Left arm (near injection site) is still tender.  Around 11:00 am, I had a low grade fever (99.9) but no other symptoms bu continue to experience a loss of taste.  It is now 3:45 pm, and I still have a low grade fever and a loss of taste.

Approximately two weeks after the vaccine shot, on 4/4, I lost feeling and went numb on my entire right side, from my head to my feet.  I had no pain other than dizziness, my face did not droop but my tongue was numb.  In the ER they took my blood pressure, and it was 251/112 or so. It was extremely high.  Also, my numbness was intermittent, it would last about 10 minutes and then slowly go away, then a couple of hours later, it might come back.  Saturday 4/3 it occurred about 4 times, on Sunday 4/4, it occurred about twice while in the hospital. I was released to home the evening of 4/4. On Monday it occurred about 1 time.

I got super hot, my stomach cramped up, my lungs tightened, my tinnitus was exacerbated, I had an instant headache and a feeling of dread. I left my car and walked to the outdoor drive-through tent to tell the med staff that I was not okay. I was crying and felt like I was going to faint. After 10-15 minutes my symptoms subsided and I drove home alone 45 miles.

Headache has lasted throughout the next few days and has finally gone away on day 7 post injection.

The patient&#39;s eyes were sore and tender for the duration of the timeframe mentioned. Also, the injection site was completely pain-free on the day of the injection.  However, the following 5 days after injection, the site became very sore and tender with no redness or swelling present.

                                                One week post-vaccine injection, sharp pains began on and off on the left side of my face. These moved from cheek to jaw to lip to left eye and at the nasal base. There was also stabbing pain in the left eye.  I thought this was due to just being tired from long days at work, but I was also aware it might have been related to the vaccine. Therefore, I took 1600 mg of acyclovir I had on hand to prevent occasional cold sores and went to sleep. The following day, unfortunately, these sharp pains persisted on and off throughout the day. I retook acyclovir and went to work. I reported this to my PCP, and she thought it was unrelated to the vaccine. I spoke with surgeons in my office, and after examination, they both clearly said it was a reaction in my 5th cranial nerve. They both recommended prednisone or methylprednisolone, but my PCP didn&#39;t agree, and therefore, I did not receive a prescription for prednisone. I retook acyclovir, and by the following afternoon of  Friday, January 15, I was no longer experiencing sharp pains on the left side of my face.

It proceeded to feeling like I wanted to vomit. I got a tingling sensation on the back of my tongue. The nurse wanted to give me Benadryl but I had driven myself. I took Benadryl once I got home.  By then, I had an aspirin taste in my mouth and change in taste along with the other symptoms. I slept through the evening with the Benadryl.  The next day the injection sight was very sore without movement or touch. I also had diarrhea. No other symptoms since.

                                                About 20 minutes after vaccine my tongue swelled about 1 and 1/2 times it?s normal size. My eyes became slightly swollen, I developed a (non-itchy) rash on my cheeks and across my nose, and a fever. My tongue also was partially numb. After about 1 hour, the tongue swelling significantly decreased and the rash began to calm. About 3 hours after the vaccine I developed severe nausea (no vomiting), body aches, and a headache. My face was also partially numb. Today I woke up with severe body aches, fever, headache, nausea, diarrhea, very sore arm.

                                                Fatigue hit within a couple of hours; So tired and this was fall in to bed and be out. I slept for awhile - I rested all day the second day. I was getting dizzy and; muscle pain; a lot of joint pain (normally I&#39;m not in a lot of pain and never this tired). I needed a cane to walk I went to work on Wednesday and I had to leave early (11:30). Wed - horrible diarrhea Started getting a little confused and  still had dizziness and joint pain was bad. Couldn&#39;t take care of patients. Went to work on Thursday and I had to leave earlier yet that day - by 9:00 am - Started having chills  but didn&#39;t have fever and still had other symptoms and was getting confused.   Had an excruciating headaches and nausea (no diarrhea but extreme nausea) and that day started light and sound sensitivity - so bad. Was getting scared driving home - and had very slurred speech. Couldn&#39;t drive for a week after that(. My sister was on the phone with me helping me stay alert and drive safely on the way home from work on that Thursday.) Thursday when I got home. - had Telemed visit - Set up appt for a rapid COVID test - and a flu test so my sister drove me and I slept the whole way there. My sister said my speech was slurred; confused in my speech and I felt like that for three days. Both (Covid and flu) tests came back negative. Times when my sister couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying and I slept more than I was awake (Thursday - Saturday was like this). Took Imodium for diarrhea when I had that. For joint pain - I treated it by tramodal 50 mg and I can take it as needed and I usually don&#39;t need it but took it consistently during this time.  What scared me the most was I could feel my Hip Implant  - ball and socket joint from bone all the way to my femur( I had Right implant on Hip on May 2019) - which is healed completely but I felt it at this time. I still can&#39;t lay on my right side without pain - like a deep bone pain.  I was going to call my surgeon today.  January 4th visit with my Dr - for check-in - He gave me a clearance to go back to work on Wed the 6th. I work two days a week; I&#39;m on disability and so have been able to work since then. Right hip pain is still  a lot and bouts of dizziness and still have joint pain. Have to take a minute and a couple of breaths to stand up. Some days I do have to use may cane. Chills are gone.

                                                1.  Out of concern for potential autoimmune reactions to the vaccine, I had some blood tests taken on 12/23/2020 prior to the first dose and repeated blood tests 3.5 weeks after dose 1.  My ANA test has been checked 2 times prior to vaccine and both were negative.  On 1/19/2021, 3.5 weeks after dose 1, my ANA is now positive at 1:80. 2.  On 12/30/2020, the left side of my lower lip began to fasciculate, have paresthesias that were constant from 12/30-12/31/2020.  On 1/1/2021, 2 blisters appeared in the area of the twitching.  I have not had problems with hsv on my lips in the past, so it was very odd to have this occur 2 days after vaccine.    I had concern for hsv reactivation and its association with Bell&#39;s palsy given the reports of Bell&#39;s palsy in study participants so I called my doctor, discussed my concerns, and asked for and took Valtrex  tid and Prednisone  qd for 5 days, starting on 1/2/2021.  The blisters resolved by 1/3/2021.  The fasciculations improved greatly, but I have had 2 episodes of my lower lip feeling heavy/numb for a few hours since then.

She was not verbally responsive and appeared to be apneic with her head shaking in her arms flailing rigidly in an up and down motion.  Symptoms lasted approximately less than 2 minutes and patient was not postictal.  She was not incontinent.  Blood sugar is in the 180s and her rectal temp is normal.

I had severe muscle aches the day after the shot and the night of the shot. I had stomach cramps and threw up once. I was very tired and slept the entire day following my injection.

                                                Covid vaccine time line 1st Moderna vaccine on 1 2 21 (Sat) given at PMH at 5:10pm.  Tired x 3 days with some cognitive issues noted (very slight..like forgetting things I never do?was slowly resolving but never completely went away.  I did not even mention this to anyone because I was not sure it was the actual vaccine, or just my brain.) 2nd Moderna vaccine on 1 30 21 (Sat) given at PMH at 2:40pm.  Immediately had more pain in L arm, swelling in upper arm and redness, fatigue. --Sun. 1 31 21:  woke up with a low grade fever, increased fatigue, chills, nausea, diarrhea, headache, body pain, joint pain (it hurt to even shower).  Fever got higher?max 100 (I think, as I was taking Tylenol at this point) and fatigue got worse by nighttime. --Mon. 2 1 21:  Called out of work due to reaction but fever was lower around 99 and less fatigued (ie I could get off of the couch, clean a bit, take care of my son).  Still rested a lot, had diarrhea, nausea, headache off and on t/o day. --Tues. 2 2 21:  Had a planned day off anyway.  Same symptoms as Monday and same energy level.  Felt positive about going back to work on Wed. --Wed. 2 3 21:  Woke up feeling the best of the past days and went to work.  Still fever of 99 and I noticed I was ?off? all day.  Example:  I forgot my schedule book and Id tags at home (I NEVER do that).  Made weird ?forgetting? mistakes.  By 1pm I was EXHAUSTED and having diarrhea, nausea, chills, and headache.  Called the Employee Exposure Line and my manager.  Went and got COVID test at request of EL and contacted immunologist and primary MD.  Immunologist is on vacation x 2 weeks and covering MD deferred to whatever primary said.  Dr. covered for my primary MD, Dr.  She asked me to touch base with her on Thurs after results from COVID test, but she recommended that  I rest ?and let my body adjust to the vaccine?. --Thurs:  2 4 21:  Up at night from 2:30am on and off with nausea, diarrhea, chills, headache, weakness, shaking, brain fog, sweating.  I am also having some anxiety at this point.  COVID test negative.  I did send a message in MyChart to Dr. as requested.  She called me later in the day and instructed me to drinking fluids and rest.  She ordered blood work which I did go and do.  Also contacted Urgent Care though MyChart and spoke with a CRNP about my symptoms.  She felt that they were a reaction to vaccine and my anxiety. --Friday:  2 5 21:  Called out of work again due to all of above symptoms.  Diarrhea has resolved and no longer any fever, however fatigue, lightheadedness and dizziness,  headache, ?brain fog?, and cognitive symptoms remain.  I am off balance and have difficulty concentrating  and reading.  I did communicate with my neurology office and they stated that it is ?just a reaction to the vaccine?. --Sat:  2 6 21:  Called Employee Exposure line to report same symptoms as above.  Same headache (almost migraine?  Having an aura?)  I am not sure why I feel so foggy.  Did have some ?clearing? of my head in the afternoon. --Sunday:  2 7 21:  Woke up feeling worse immediately.  Horrible headache, lightheadedness, off balance, difficulty focusing and concentrating.  No fever.  Called Employee Exposure Line to report symptoms and they recommended that I call the Urgent Care MD again.  Called urgent Care MD through MyChart again and tried to go into see her at Healthcare, however it was snowing hard and I slipped 3 times so I called the Healthcare and made apt for Monday 2 8 21 for 10:30am. --Monday:  2 8 21:  Headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty with multitasking as of this AM.  Went to Healthcare and saw CRNP.  She wrote for Augmentin for possible sinus infection and I filled at the pharmacy.  She instructed me to see my neurologist regarding possible neuro symptoms from COVID injection reaction.  I communicated with workers from comp team.  I am allowed to see the neurologist from the Dr. office.  I called their office and office manager tried to refer me back to primary.  I insisted that I see the lady as I was referred from CRNP at Worker?s Comp.  They were agreeable to a telemed appointment as soon as I get my claim number.  I am exhausted, have a headache, and difficulty focusing at this point.  Sore throat started this AM and is way worse tonight.  B swollen glands near carotids.  Started Augmentin. --Tues: 2 9 21:  Cont headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty concentrating, difficulty with lights and sounds.  Trouble reading.  Saw neurology this AM at 10am in the office as opposed to telemed visit and had a MRI at 12pm.  She diagnosed a fair amount of things including vaccine reaction possibly causing intractable headache, migraine, dizziness w/o vertigo.  Wants me to start to Propanolol for the headaches.  Need to pick up from the pharmacy.  Out of work until 2 15 21 and then a partial return to work?  Not sure how that works.  Hopefully just feeling better and can go back full time.  I have to contact the neurologist through portal at the end of week to update on progress. Health care called me and wants me to have a visit with a vaccine specialist.  I need to fill out CDC form for vaccine incidents.  Bad headache tonight that started behind R eye and is now whole head.  Need to call ENT tomorrow to discuss MRI results.  Left the neurologist a question on portal about MRI.  --Wed. 2 10 21:  Woke up with light headedness, fatigue, dizziness, off balance, feeling ?off? cognitively.  Pressure around R eye and R sinuses.

When we arrived the patient was found sitting in an upright position on a chair; she was conscious and alert. We were informed by medical staff on scene(EMT) the patient had developed some redness on her chest and had been given 50 mg Benadryl prior to our arrival. Patient informed us she has a history of adverse reactions to vaccines so she was expecting something to happen. She said she had initially gotten a feeling of warm/flushing from her feet and up into her body and then developed the redness. She also said her tongue had been feeling numb but she denied any shortness of breath or chest palpitations associated with her symptoms. According to the patient and provider on scene the redness was improving after the Benadryl. Patient also said her tongue was feeling normal again. The patient did not want to be transported to the hospital as she said she was feeling better. Health department staff on scene was going to be sending Benadryl with the patient in case she needed more. Patient signed medical release and ED cleared.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after receiving the second dose I experienced itching at the injection site on my arm, sore arm, nausea, body aches, chills, high temperature  up to around 103, fatigue and restlessness,  my heart was racing, and I was experiencing Pulsatile tinnitus in my ears where I could hear whooshing sounds that I assume were of my heartbeat.  This lasted for two days and started to get better around the 3rd day.

                                                Two weeks after my first covid vaccine, I experienced weak muscles., light headedness, brain fog and general malaise. It was alarming due to being so far after the foretold reaction time. I tested negative for covid twice because the symptoms lasted two weeks right up to my second dose.  My doctor stated that this far of a delayed response was uncommon but hoped it wasn&#39;t unusual and to keep hydrated.  On 2/25, one week after my second dose which was administered 2/17, I experienced acute blurred vision followed by memory loss. Events that I participated in had to be told to me with my having no recollection of them. I was told that I spoke of feeling dizzy &#34;like  being on a boat&#34; and feeling brain fog before falling asleep for hours. I wake up with no memory of any of the events. This has happened three times since.  2/25, 2/26 and 2/28 so far.  It is very alarming and concerning and I wonder if it is normal to have these side effects although they are not mentioned on any website I have visited when researching side effects. I have once again contacted my doctor for further advice.

                                                2.5 hours after injection I started feeling weird, clammy cold sweats, nauseous and it felt like my eyes were bulging or like an intense pressure behind my eyes, blurry eyesight, extreme headache.  I have not ever had any issues with my blood pressure only my diabetes.  It had recently been slightly elevated but controlled mostly. I knew it was high and it suddenly just came on even after not eating at that time. I proceeded to flush with alot of water and some walking to bring it down. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure of how high it got because I don&#39;t normally have to bring my tester to work with me. However as soon as I got home I tested it and even after heavy flushing and exercise my glucose level was down to 500. It has never been that high ever. I continued to flush and monitor and not eating due to nausea and headache I was taken to the hospital. At that time my glucose reading was at 400. I was given 10 units of novolog as well as 1 full bag of fluid thru an IV.  And before I was discharged it had come down to 192.  I have only had to have insulin 1 time since 2008-9. Since then my sugar is refusing to come down below 250. My vision is still not clear and I am now attempting to keep it down with 15 units of a fast acting insulin multiple times a day. I will also be starting metformin again as of tomorrow morning to also help bring it down to a more healthy level due to the possibility of another life altering stroke.

Soon I was feeling more scattered numbness and tingling on R side of face. After about 15 min, was sort of slurping while talking, like after getting numbing at dentist. No noticeable drooping of R side of face. This more or less resolved after 20-30 min however in the past many days, I feel occasional numbness or tingling - very minor. Worried about 2nd dose but do plan to get it.

                                                Within 8 hours of shot administration, I was running fever and experiencing chills.  Ran fever (as high as 102.7) for the next 48 hours.  Lethargic, no appetite, muscle and joint aches, severe headache.  The symptoms experienced in the 48 hours after vaccine were vastly more sever than the symptoms I had when I had COVID.  Fever broke during the night on 1.21.21.  Felt much better on 1.22.21, but was still very tired and had headaches.  On 1.25.21, I awoke with a SEVERE headache on the left side of my forehead and temple.  My eye was bothering me.  When I looked in the mirror, my left eyelid was swollen and red.  The left corner of my mouth was drooping.  My doctor diagnosed me with Bell&#39;s Palsy on 1.25.21.  Symptoms are worse today.  She prescribed a steroid dose pack to help with the inflammation of the facial nerve.  Steroids were started today, 1.26.21.

The best way to describe it is that my &#34;face meat&#34; felt numb.  So, not the surface skin, but deep down in the muscles. Almost like when you are numb from dental work.   I am still feeling the face numbness today. Not in the roof of my mouth so much, but in my face meat.

                                                Within 1 hour of the vaccine, pain in the injection site worse than the first dose.  By 6pm on 2/21, I experienced fatigue and minor arthralgia / myalgia.  By 9pm on 2/21, the arthralgia/myalgia worsened.  The pain in the bones was severe enough for me to not be able to feel comfortable in any position.  I chose not to take any NSAIDs at the time.  By 1am on 2/22, I awoke with chills and a fever of 103.   I was shivering and sweating.  At that point, I did take ibuprofen.  I woke up at 7am on 2/22 in terrible muscle and joint pain.    I had still had a 101 fever.  I worked for 4 hours that morning.  At 1pm, I went back to be with the same symptoms.  Fever went back to 103.  I had brain fog and unable to concentrate.  It was hard to climb stairs.  I experienced shooting pains at times.  Continued fever and pain through the night.   Injection site pain also.  The morning of 2/23 I woke up with the fever still at 7am.  I took my second dose of ibuprofen.  I was able to work that evening.  My fever broke at noon on 2/23.  On the evening of 2/23 I notice a delayed reaction at the injection site.  I developed red blotches that were hot to touch and painful.  The blotches went from my deltoid to my elbow.  My muscle &amp; back pain had resolved at that point however I developed a soreness at the base of my skull from ear to ear.  I was unable to look up at the ceiling with limited range of motion.  I developed a runny nose and a slight cough.    My soft palette also felt swollen at 11pm on 2/23.   I woke up on 2/24 with the neck pain resolved.  The arm was still red and warm to touch.  My  other symptoms resolved I just felt worn out.  On the evening of 2/24, I developed a metallic taste in my mouth.  The metallic taste resolved by the end of day 2/25.  As of today, 2/26 I am feeling 90% better.

                                                Approximately 7 minutes after being vaccinated I started to feel slightly woozy, then my heart starting beating hard and fast. I felt like my throat was tight and I felt pressure on my chest like I couldn?t breathe. My vision started to fade and I felt light headed. My hands started to feel numb and were tingling, and I felt nauseated . I told the attendant I felt sick and a nurse listened to my heart which was beating at 130 beats per minute, and took my blood pressure (153/94) .After noting my elevated heart rate and blood pressure I still couldn?t catch my breath and was given oxygen by EMS and taken to the local Emergency room.  In the ER my heart rate returned to normal after a few hours, and my blood pressure returned to normal as well.

Symptoms returned again at approx 39 hours and returned to Emergency Department again for more IV medications. Asthma attacks - started in the Emergency Department on first day and have continued to today 3/3/2021. Prior to vaccination, I used inhaler approx 1x every 60 days at most.  Have gone more than a year without using one.  After vaccination, used inhaler the same evening and then 12 times the next day, and several times before going to ED again, and have had to use it daily since.  This morning 3/3/2021, woke at apprise 2:30-3:00 am with an attack that needed 2 doses to subside, and then again at 8:30 this am about 1.5 hours after waking.  Burning on tongue with sores on outer sides, metallic/burning/no taste - began 20 minutes after vaccination continuing to today. Rash on face - began in Emergency Department on first day and continues to today. Began using Cortizone yesterday 3/3/2021.

                                                Immediately after shot: I felt some pain &amp; burning at injection sight. In general felt a little off, but nothing significant. After observation period, on the drive home, I began to &#34;taste&#34; the shot, as did my husband who received vaccine right after me. Then, my face felt a little funny, and my jaw felt tight, but no visible swelling. Then I felt a rush of burning sensation throughout my chest and abdominal region. After arriving home, 20 minutes later, I felt a little nauseated, but not bad. An hour later, I was unable to eat dinner, as I felt ill. I felt like I had a mild fever and I was shivering with chills. While trying to sleep, the chills continued. I then experienced unusual frequent urination, every 2 to 3 hours. I had no consumed abnormal amounts of liquid, but my urine was nearly clear, which was odd. After returning to bed after the first time urinating, my heart rate became very fast and I felt like I had a hard time finding my pulse in my neck, which is unusual for me.   The day after the vaccination I experience headache, a lot of tenderness around injection sight and arm muscle pain making it very painful to make certain movement, like putting on my top and reaching for objects. That evening I experience some muscle aches.   These symptoms have improved now that it is day three after the vaccination. I still have a mild headache and pain at injection sight.

Can smell coffee, candles etc. if nose is held close. Cannot taste coffee, oranges, toothpaste, salt, mustard, etc.  Had no symptoms 1/30, 1/31, or 1/1. Starting 1/2, had a migraine (including nausea) that persisted until 1/8. As patient (me) has cluster migraines, its difficult to say if this was related to vaccine, but feel it should be noted this was an especially intense migraine week (also was with menstruation so likely &#34;normal&#34;)  Other than that, feel generally tired.

                                                Within a couple of minutes my heart started racing and my lips and tongue was also tingling. My arm where I got the shot was also tingling. For a few seconds I felt nauseous but that quickly passed. There was no swelling, no rash,  and I never had any breathing problems. I was monitored for almost an hour. My heart rate  returned to normal.

                                                I am an RN and was working a Covid 19 vaccine clinic for first responders. I took my own 1st administration of Moderna at approx 6:20 then went out to vaccinate/data entry. I noticed I was a little bit shaky and more jittery than normal but I attributed that to getting first vaccination clinic off the ground and problems we were having with computers and login. When I was leaving approx 2 hours later and all settled down I went to my car and noticed small area near front of tongue in R side. I also had small feelings of tingling or what felt like small electric current around edges of my tongue. My throat was sore but I had thought that was from talking to so many vaccinated first responders and having to talk over my n95 mask.  Upon getting home approx 12 minutes later I noticed my tongue had swollen. I was not having trouble breathing. Throat was red but no swelling noted. I took my Zyrtec early and then. 50 mg of Benadryl and it was relieved within 40 minutes. I did not need to seek any medical care and over the counter meds remedied the issue.

                                                About 15 minutes after the vaccine, the top of my tongue became tingly (like when your hand starts to fall asleep).  No swelling, trouble breathing, or throat swelling, just a tingling on the top of the tongue like it was on my taste buds. But I could still taste things.  I did not take anything for it as I wanted to see what was going to happen. It never got worse from when I noticed it, and it got better as the day went on. It took about 8-9 hours to be completely gone. I am not sure if this was a possible side effect or a reaction.

                                                Body aches; Fever 99.8F; Chills; Entire left arm muscle is in pain on movement; Choking in the throat; Facial Flush; Blurred vision; Dizziness; Confusion; I had no emotions; A spontaneous report was received from a pharmacist concerning a 48-years old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced choking, flushing, vision blurred, dizziness, confusional state, emotional disorder, body aches, pyrexia, chills and limb discomfort.  The patient&#39;s medical history included migraines and a hysterectomy. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included sumatriptan, naratriptan hydrochloride, and galconezumab.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A) in the left deltoid intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   A pharmacist called stating she received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 02 Jan 2021 at 9:45am in her left deltoid. Immediately after receiving the vaccine, she had facial flushing, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion and choking in the throat that lasted 20 minutes. After a few hours, she stated confusion would come and go, and she had no emotions. The next morning, the confusion was gone. On 03 Jan 2021, she reported having body aches and a fever of 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. She reported chills, body aches, and a lot of pain in the left arm. If she tried to move her left arm, the entire muscle in the left arm hurt.  Treatment for the events included acetaminophen and an antihistamine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was withdrawn.   The events, choking, flushing, vision blurred, were considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events, confusional state, emotional disorder, and dizziness, were considered resolved on 03 Jan 2021. The events, body aches, pyrexia, chills, and limb discomfort, were not considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 48 year old female patient with medical history of migraines, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Choking, non-serious unexpected events of Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, Confusional state, Emotional disorder, Pain, and Limb discomfort, and non-serious expected events of Pyrexia and Chills. The events of Choking, Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, and Confusional state occurred immediately after administration of their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A). The event of Emotional disorder occurred on the same day when the patient received mRNA-1273. The events of Pain, Pyrexia, Chills, and Limb discomfort occurred on the next day of mRNA-1273 administration. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I woke up the next morning (about 6am) with nausea/chills/fever (100.9)/headache/eyes were burning. I had to go to ED after getting to work(at 7:30am) due to SOB/elevated heart rate of 145-150bpm/101.6 temp (upon arrival to ED)/chills/nausea/headache. I was given IV fluids (2 liters), Zofran for nausea, Toradol for pain/headache, Tylenol for fever. I was in the ED for about 4-4 1/2 hours. My right eye has a large &#34;blood shot&#34; area that wasn&#39;t there until I took the vaccine also. I was found to still have a count of &#34;34&#34; on my Covid antibody blood test. The ED physician stated that was probably the reason I had the reaction was because I still had antibodies. I tested positive for Covid on Sept 19, 2020 and took the vaccine #1 1/11/2021 (almost 120 days from positive Covid test). If I had known I was going to have any type of reaction because I still had antibodies, I would have waited a few more weeks/months to get the vaccine. This should really be looked into. I am now very scared to receive the 2nd vaccine because of the side effects that has been reported after the 2nd vaccine. I really need good advice about what to do about 2nd vaccine.

                                                This may be a duplicate report, as primary care notes state the process has been initiated. However, out of an abundance of caution, and as the facility the event was reported to, I wanted to enter this report for completeness due to the unusual events. Patient received 1st dose of moderna covid vaccine at an outside facility and (per patient) had a seizure at that site immediately following the injection (history of seizures due to past meningitis, no seizures in past 3 months per patient). No medications were given, 911 was not called, patient not instructed to go to ED (per patient). Patient went home. Once home, patient reported &#34;stroke like symptoms&#34; on her right side (weakness and inability to close right eye for 30 minutes, numbness in R thigh and heel). Then weakness moved to left side (numbness/tingling in L hand and eye, numbness in L lower leg) along with some swelling to face/tongue. Had back pain but no chest pain or difficulty breathing.  Extreme dizziness. No additional seizures. The next day she called our nursing line to report these symptoms and was instructed to go to the ED and also scheduled a visit with primary care provider the next morning. Patient stated she was feeling better and apparently did not go to the ED, instead choosing to see PCP next morning. On presentation to PCP, injection site was red and swollen, itching and swelling in hands, itching in bottom of feet, widespread joint pain. No visible rash, no dysphagia, no difficulty breathing. Other symptoms had largely resolved. Patient was prescribed benadryl (no steroids due to allergy to prednisone), cold compresses for injection site and sent home with instructions to go to ED if symptoms reappeared. Also recommended making an appointment with a neurologist for additional follow up as patient currently does not see a neurologist for seizures and is treating with CBD/THC only.

I&#39;m assuming a lymph node. Then the lymph node under the right side mandible was swollen and painful. That lasted for about 2 weeks. About a week after symptoms went away I felt a stabbing pain under my right mandible and severe throat pain. Once again, my lymph node felt swollen. That lasted about 3 or 4 days.

                                                I had extreme pain at the injection site that afternoon that then included my arm from elbow to top of my shoulder.  That pain continued with the area very hot and difficult to lift my arm (which continued until Saturday, 1/30/21.)  After being asleep, I woke at about 10:50 pm, abruptly to racing heart beat, sense of tingling/numbness inside ears, feeling of swollen tongue (back of tongue) and then later feeling of tightness in throat. This was just less than 12 hours after my vaccination.   I sat upright sipping cold liquids for approx 2 hrs and sensations faded.   Next day I had headache, fatigue and felt extremely cold later in day for several hours. Occasional dizziness for the next 2 days with chills.

                                                I had a very painful injection site and also area got swollen and red. Like a bruise.  For about 4 days. I took Ibuprofen and Tylenol and it was hard to sleep because it was very painful. New Years eve I started feeling my throat scratchy so I made me some honey tea. As I sipped  the tea, my son entered the room and made a remark regarding the tea smell and then I realized that I could not smell the tea, but could still taste it. Concerned it could be a sign of COVID I sanitized all areas and stayed in my room. Next morning I noticed my smell and taste were compromised.  I communicated with the employee health and was tested on the 4th and my rapid test was negative and I could not believe it.  So I decided to go to the UC and I was tested for flu, strep and Covid I was tested positive around 4PM on the same day (01/04/2021).  On 01/02 I noticed I was nauseated around 6:30PM til 10PM and next morning it was gone. On 01/03 I had headache and chills about the same time, I developed diarrhea on the 4th later in the evening as well. On the 5th, 6th and 7th I had cough and on the 9th I had diarrhea again and after that by the weekend everything had resolved  and I felt better.

                                                I received my first injection of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on Monday evening (1/25/2021) and my arm became very sore. The next day, I could not lift my arm. By Wednesday (1/27/2021) morning, I had a terrible migraine type headache, chills, muscle aches and nausea. I went to bed and sleep the whole day. I took ibuprofen which helped ease symptoms. The headache went away by Friday but I had lingering nausea &amp; tiredness for several days and food tasted strange to me. I felt better by Monday, Feb 1, but then on Tuesday, February 2 in the evening, I developed a large hive and swelling on my left arm where I had received the injection. I also had smaller hives on my chest and neck. I took Benadryl and the swelling went down and by Wednesday morning (2/3)- the hives were gone and feel somewhat normal again.

                                                After I received the shot I went to the observation room. I could feel the shot move from my left arm (where I got the shot) to my right arm and down to my hand. After 10 minutes I felt the shot go down both legs at the same time and come back up close to my chest. About 5 minutes after that sensation, my chest got a little tight and I was having a hard time breathing and the right side of my face started to tingle. I looked down at my hands and the finger tips of my right hand were blue.  I raised my hand and the nurse came over and took me to the back room. I thought maybe my hands were dirty, so I washed them off. My right fingertips were still blue.   I could feel tingles all over the right side of my face and my lips went a little numb. I kept pressing them together to see if that would help. My throat started to feel swollen and the nurses gave me some benedryl.  I left after an hour and went home. The tingling on the right side of my face stayed with me for another 2 days.  I have no known allergies.  That was my experience.

                                                Patient was advised to sit for 15 minutes after the vaccination. The first time around patient did not have any allergic reaction to the vaccination. The patient was aware that there was still a potential of an reaction to the vaccination  the second time. The patient sat in the same room vaccinations were being given after her vaccination. She felt a little stuffy so she asked if you could sit outside right by the door. When she went to sit outside in 2 minutes she started to cough and her airways became constricted along with her hands, face and tongue started to swell. Instantly we rushed to her with an Epi Pen but the patient had her own which she took out and used. We laid her on the floor putting a pillow beneath her head while raising her legs up in the air. The facility dialed 911 along with providing an oxygen mask. One minute after the Epi Pen the patient started to feel better then help arrived 5 minutes later to which she felt her airways constricting again. After the emergency help took her to the ER she came back in 3 hours and said she felt fine and the ER had released her.

                                                It started with tingling in my tongue (which I ignored), then it became numbness that spread down my throat I also became short of breath. That&#39;s when I notified one of the nurses. They checked my blood pressure. I vaguely remember hearing it was high (189/?). They called 911 and the paramedics came. Shortness of breath became worse and chest pains started. The paramedic gave me Benadryl and then epinephrine since I was increasingly getting worse. I was shaking  and I felt lethargic. I could not control the shaking and I felt cold. I do not remember a lot of details when I got to the Emergency Room. Looking at my record they gave me: LORazepam (ATIVAN), methylPREDNISolone sod suc(PF)(SOLU-MEDROL) and famotidine. I went home that night with the condition that I see my primary care physician. I felt like I have the flu and soreness of arm the next couple days. I went back to work after four days.

                                                The day of the injection, approx. 3-4 minutes after getting the injection, I almost passed out.  I became hot, sweaty, dizzy and my head starting to buzz.  The nurse on-site provided me a couple cold packs and after about 30 minutes, I felt better. The nurse described my response as a &#34;vascular&#34; reaction.  Later that night, I got a headache and night sweats and bouts of nausea.  They only lasted a day.    Approx. 10 days after the injection,  the injection site became red, swollen, itchy and uncomfortable to the touch. Then it traveled down my arm and created a large red, swollen, itchy area on my entire upper arm.   I advised my doctor and she provided me a Rx for a topical steroid and oral steroid.    After 5 days of treatment, it is 90% better.   The injection site still hurts.

I also started menstrual bleeding despite being in what I thought to be menopause, I had not menstrated for 6 months. Three days after the shot my left lymph node in my armpit began to swell and be painful to the touch.  I am now seven days post vaccine and my armpit and lymph node are still very sore and swollen and I do not feel 100%, a general unwell feeling. I am having serious doubts that I will get the second dose.

                                                The moment I received the vaccine, my throat immediately tightened, but I could breathe fine. It just caught my attention. I pulled forward for the required 15-minute wait.  The end of my tongue became numb, so I told the observing staff what was happening. As I was talking, I became light-headed, dizzy. I was told to drive over to the nurse station. I was able to drive slowly, down the parking aisle to the nurse station. She watched me for 15 minutes.   Before releasing me, she told me to report to the nurse station after I get the 2nd vaccine shot for 30-minute observation.                   The numbness faded. I was light-headed for a few hours. I had a headache when I woke up the next morning, lasting most of the day. The next few days  I had a sore arm, as expected.

Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

My nose became immediately and intensely congested to the point there was pressure, I felt heated and as I communicated that I may be having a reaction my throat started to swell. Then it suddenly released. A heat ban moved down my body to my abdomen.  I waited for about 20-25 minutes and felt fine. Then about 45 minutes later, I experienced tingling in my lips and very mild congestion. The tingling and mild congestion would perhaps come on and subside with less intensity over the next hour.  Very mild congestion continued on and off until the next afternoon.

As the day progressed the numbness spread out to my cheeks and to the tip of my nose. The next day the numbness was still there, but was going away except for the tip of my tongue. As of today I still have the feeling (as if I burned my tongue and a metallic taste). Food does not taste as good as before.

                                                I had an array of symptoms that all lasted about 3-4 minutes and then another symptom would start about 10 minutes after. Started with feeling lightheaded but that symptom lasted about 10 minutes.  The other symptoms I&#39;m about to list each lasted about 3-4 minutes.  Moderate Jaw pain, mild radiating pain down my left arm, moderate bilateral clavicle pain,  radiating pain down my right leg. Moderate to severe pain at the base of my skull.  Felt woozy with this pain.  Then had severe sudden mid-chest pain with palpitations.   I Had high blood pressures the entire time about 168/88 but when this chest pain happened Bp was like 148/110.  O2 sat was 98%.  ICU dr came to assess me but stated my HR didn&#39;t seem that fast to him and offered to take me to hospital - next door to get further checked but my symptoms started to subside. I did get chills and was shaking after this but after that resolved I felt a lot better.  My BP came back down to like 118/72

I am a nurse and had nurses with me, so I did not go back to the facility for care. Numbness of anterior 1/3 of the tongue and felt  &#34;distant&#34; from surroundings within a few minutes of the injection. Symptoms progressed to numbness to the left side of the face and head. This sensation lasted a few minutes, then disappeared altogether. After about 30 more minutes, my entire tongue and head felt numb and I felt &#34;distant&#34; again. It became difficult to swallow as well. This too lasted a few minutes and disappeared altogether. I was left with a severe headache that lasted a few hours.

It went away after a couple hours.  3) My left arm was swollen and red for two days and now only hurts when pressure is applied and is now fine. 4)I did not have any fever, diahrea, vomiting,

                                                1/19/2021 - Right arm around injection sight was itchy.  I thought it was an insect bite.  Did not correlate it with the vaccine. 1/20/2021 - Right arm around injection continued to be itchy and red.  It was getting my attention more in the evening after I got home from work.  At this point, I realized it must be related to the vaccine. 1/21/2021 - Right arm around injection site was itching more to the point where I am constantly aware of it.  Area is red &amp; hot to the touch.  Late morning, a coworker notice my right eye (white part) was red.  It was like that when I was getting ready for work that morning.  By 1:00 my eye was burning &amp; watery.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s an allergic reaction or pink eye or if it&#39;s even related to COVID-19 Vaccine.  It is now 5:45p and my left eye is feeling irritated, but not visibly red.  I am at high risk of exposure.  I decided to get the COVID-19 test (the throat swab)  this afternoon, round 3:30p.  I should received my results 2-5 days.  I also bought Benadryl 25mg.  I will be taking it this evening.

                                                About an hour after I received the Moderna vaccine, the left side of the face felt warm and being to tingle.  My left ear, my left cheek and my lower lip to the midline felt like pins and needles.  It began to get more numb and I had a lot of difficulty eating my lunch because I started to bite my lip because it was so numb.  I then took 50 mg of Benedryl in  Tablet form.  Within 45minutes the numbness dissipated and has not returned.  I have no weakness or drooping.  The numbness has not returned.  My left arm was really sore for 3 days but is no longer painful.

                                                At 2 a.m. on January 10th, I woke up with a high pitched ringing  sound in my head. The sound was constant and disrupts my sleep significantly. It is always present but not as noticeable during the day when there is noise in the surrounding area, however, my job requires a lot of report writing and for that I work in silence. Therefore, the ringing sound is very distracting and makes it hard to focus. I saw my general practitioner, on January 14th at 4:15 p.m.. She cleaned out my right ear and started me on a 6-day steroid. She did not clean out the left ear because it did not appear to have any wax buildup. I began taking the steroid on Saturday January 16th. The ringing is still there but it does seem to be more on my left side than my right now. I went to an ent specialist on January 19th who checked my hearing and said there was no hearing loss. Her recommendations were to call her in a week and if ringing doesn&#39;t go away, she will try another steroid. As of today, the ringing is still present and I have finished the course of steroid.

                                                Extreme dizziness, darkened vision as happens before losing consciousness, feeling of losing consciousness. All symptoms repeated in 5 waves. First wave hit about 10 min after dose and last about 60 seconds. 2nd wave hit a minute later and lasted approximately 30 seconds. 3rd wave hit 2 minutes later and lasted about 60 seconds with some shaking in core/diaphragm area.  4th wave hit 8-10 minutes after that and lasted 5 minutes. 4th wave was precipitated by shaking starting in diaphragm area and branching out to extremities and jawline. Shaking was uncontrollable and made speaking impossible. Shaking passed after about 6 minutes when wave subsided. 5th wave hit about 10 minutes later and was dizziness/darkening vision with disorientation, no shaking.  EMS responded to first wave by removing me from my car and having me sit in a chair, removing my mask to breath better, took vitals. Vitals were taken several times, oxygen levels varying from 93 - 98.  Oxygen was ready nearby but not used. Blood pressure varied, don?t have the readings. EMT gave water immediately and then pretzels about 30 minutes after the episodes began. I was kept for observation for an hour total after inoculation and then released to go home as symptoms had fully subsided.

                                                At the time of injection, I felt tingling in the arm. The night of the injection my arm hurt, a bruise was present and a large lump (1 inch by 2 inches) was present. Blood was also in the band aid ( 1 drop) applied to the injection site. The night of, I had shortness of breath, and severe right eye socket pain. I also had tenderness on the right and left side of the tongue. The injection site swelling and tongue pains were significantly reduced by 01/24/201.  On 1/26/2021 I visited my eye doctor who took pictures of my eyes to confirm no internal injury since pain around the sockets was still present . I have been prescribed eye drops. If the pain does not go way as of 1/28/2021 I will revisit my eye doctor.

Today is 3rd day out and my outer corner of left lip has a little fuller and feels that way  compared to other side, when you look at it there doesn?t seem to be a physical change. This the original spot in which I felt it come on. I had this similar response with first dose but this didn?t come on until 5-6 hours later. I have reported this adverse effects with this site as well.

                                                My day began working in the Medical Surgical Unit, once I received the injection I was feeling fine. Five hours past and my eyes became itchy and swollen. Immediately after I started to have an itchy throat while my nose was congested. After conversing with my house supervisor she told me to call Employee Health Nurse. After that they directed me to the ER because my symptoms were worsening. At the ER they took my vitals and then the doctor came to assess me.  She told me that I was having a severe allergic reaction to the vaccination. They started an IV gave me Benadryl, Epinephrine and Pepcid. After, the nurses monitored me for 4 hours until they decided I was well enough to go home. The doctor prescribed me with Epinephrine and Prednisone.

                                                Pt was being observed for 15 minutes after covid vaccine administration. Pt was noticed to be &#34;sleepy&#34; and  RN SB went to talk to pt who appeared to be lightheaded. I went and got the available emergency kit for RN   SB to check pt&#39;s pulse ox. Pt&#39;s SaO2 was 99% and Pulse was 89. Pt reports that she had a recent heart cath and high blood pressure. Pt reports not taking her blood pressure medication prior to coming. 5-10 minutes after covid vaccine pt was more alert and stated she was feeling better but had vision changes. Pt&#39;s blood pressure was checked and it was 160/110 which was taken manually, pulse ox 98% and pulse was 87. Pt denies difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Pt able to speak in full sentence. Pt was told that we would like her to stay for further evaluation. Pt was able to ambulate without difficulty to another place in the auditorium for further observation. 30 minutes post covid vaccination pt was alert and respirations were even/unlabored. BP 130/110 on both arms manually, pulse 67 and SpO2 99%. Pt still complaining of blurred vision/double vision. Pt was talking to husband on phone without difficulty and asking him to move to garage area to pick her up. Pt was told to follow up with her cardiologist and PCP. 45 minutes after vaccine admin pt asked if I could help her call her cardiologist office. I told her yes. I called Doctor&#39;s office and was transferred to the nurse line. The nurse told me that she was not Doctor&#39;s nurse but she would send him a note and recommends pt go the emergency department for vision changes. Pt was told the recommendation and called husband to tell him to meet her at ED while we were waiting for a wheel chair to transport pt. Pt works in nutrition and there was a supervisor or manager that knew her and said that he would let them know what was going on. She was supposed to work at 1330 today. Pt walked to wheelchair without difficulty and pt was transported to ED. Pt&#39;s husband was at the ED waiting when we got there. ED triage nurse was updated that pt had received 2nd dose of covid vaccine, had a recent heart Cath and was told by cardiologist office to go to ED for vision changes.

This then turned into full left side numb/foggy feeling. I was with my son (and I&#39;m a nurse) so I asked him to test for signs of a stroke. I could smile evenly but it didn&#39;t feel like it. I had strength in both hands and could lift my arms. I was able to communicate what to look for to my son without slurred speech. But I was not stable on my left foot and felt as if I was listing to the left side. My left side was foggy. I moved my arm but flet it in slow motion. When I got home, I sat down and stretched. The symptoms went away and I was able to continue the day without episode. The episode lasted 20-30 minutes as I was walking home still. In hind sight, I did have a similar eposide after the first dose (Moderna lot 037K20A on 1/29/20) while exercising at home but sat down and thought it was due to a hard workout. That time it was just a weak left leg that was giving out on me and lasted 5 minutes because I stopped the workout.

I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

Went to the restroom and felt like I was going to pass out.  Tingling came back  across my upper body (chest level to shoulder level), I began to shake excessively, my mouth got very dry and my skin became splotchy.  I was breathing hard like I had just ran flights of stairs.  Nurses were called and I was given Benadryl and taken to the Emergency Room at a neighboring hospital where they hooked me up to I believe heart and BP monitors.  My blood pressure was very high and my heart was pounding so hard.  Was given steroid pills.  All day I urinated excessively and my heart pounded hard.

                                                On the way home I developed upper lip swelling followed by some right cheek swelling. At this point, I got really concerned ( maybe overly) but I pulled into a parking lot and called 911. I never had difficulty breathing and I had  a normal pulse oximetry. The fire department stayed with me for a while and it did not worsen, so I declined the ambulance ride and headed home.  The swelling lasted about 3 hours and resolved in reverse direction ( lip first, followed by the cheek)

Later, aprox 3-4 hours,  as  symptoms subsided  (headache, body aches, lethargic, heart rate returned to normal a few hours after injection), a new symptoms arise with numbness in my left leg from the knee down to my foot ,injection sight  and arm soreness, and the back of my throat felt &#34;funny&#34; and dry it lasted aprox an hour (fyi: drank plenty of water throughout these symptoms).  I took my normal medication. Went to sleep. Woke up and numbness was gone.  Injection sight is still a bit sore but not as intense. I am feeling well today with little or no symptoms at all.

                                                I started to have mild symptoms (malaise, flush feeling and then numb, tingling, weak hands followed by joint pain) in the afternoon of 1/7. The symptoms progressively worsened into what my husband (an immunologist) called an intense hyperimmune response. I had severe COVID symptoms (intensified from my experience having the virus in Sept): fever 100-102, flushed face, intense muscular and some neurologic symptoms--joint arthralgia and myalgia, headache, shivers/rigors, extreme weakness (especially my hands) and later I could barely stand or walk, glandular pain with minor swelling (axillary and neck), nausea, and my hearing was temporarily diminished--nearly lost for a few minutes; tylenol 500 mg taken the night of 1/7. The intense symptoms have subsided. Currently I am tired, weak, achy, and afebrile (last ibuprofen 200 mg taken last night). My hands remain weak.

I waited 30 min from vaccine time to make sure I was going to be ok. At 5:30 pm on 1/6/21 I noticed I stared itching my right arm around the inside of the elbow. I noticed my vision blurring and I had a sudden onset of a Horrific headache. By 6 pm I was itching very severely. It was as if I was clawing at my skin. I called one of the dr&#39;s I  work with and he called me in a medrol dose pack. I started the dose pack at 8:30 pm on the 6th. The headache continued, I tried motrin, fiorcet, and oxycodone with no relief. I still have the headache but it is not as intense as it was. I was up all night itching and dealing with the headache by the am , my jaw was  visibly swollen and it felt like I had been in a fight. I was not able to go to work on 1/7/21 and could only work 1/2 day on 1/8/21. the itching did not subside much till sat 1/9 but is coming back as I  taper down off the steroids. My last pill was this am. The jaw pain and swelling lasted till sat night and is subsiding daily. I may have to call my pcp and be seen this week.

                                                On 01/07/21, I woke up around 4 a.m. with a fever, headache, and severe body aches. I felt the same as I felt when I had COVID-19 on 11/01/20. I remained achy all day with a fever up to 103.4.  I was fever free by the morning of 01/08/21 and returned to work but still not feeling well, still a little achy.  On 01/10/21, I woke at around 5 a.m. with hives, a rash, and severe itching. The rash and hives were migrating from one part of my body to another. It started on my torso and buttocks and then migrated to my arms and legs.  I took Benadryl with some relief. My feet were itching most of the night even after taking more Benadryl. On 01/11/21, I went to work and continued to have itching with a rash and hives on my legs and arms and then on my neck and face.  My eyelids and lips began to swell. I was seen by provider and given Benadryl IM as well as a steroid IM (I think Depo-Medrol).  They also gave me a Rx for famotidine and loratadine.  I continued to have some itching all over and severe itching and swelling of my fingers that evening. I took Benadryl later that evening and loratadine and famotidine at bedtime I felt much better by the next morning with only slight swelling of my eyelids and slight itchiness. It took a couple of days for my eyelids to return to normal with no swelling.

                                                Approximately 10 min after getting her vaccine she reported some mild blurry vision. She put her (fairly new) glasses on and had no further complaints. She waited at least 15 min and then left. Several minutes later she returned saying she started to feel dizzy as she drove off so she came back. We brought her directly to an exam room. BP 160/100, O2 100%, HR 82. Exam was unremarkable and patient was in NAD. She reported some sinus pressure between/above her eyes. No other sx reported including no SOB, hives, itching, swelling. She was given Zyrtec 10 mg and observed for around 25 minutes. BP improved: 150/90 then 140/88. Symptoms improved and she had no complaints including with standing &amp; walking. She returned home safely and after that developed generalized itching without any rash/hives. Continued to deny SOB, swelling.  We will check on her again tomorrow and she has agreed to keep us updated as well.

I didn?t see medical attention because I could breathe normally but I self monitored for a few hours to make sure my  breathing was ok. I immediately took Benadryl and continued to monitor. It took about 3-4 days for the swelling to go away by massaging my face and continuing Benadryl.

The next day I had fever, chills, nausea and it just continued. Yesterday morning I had my husband take me to ER and I had lost 15 pounds since Wednesday. I couldn&#39;t keep down fluids. They tested me for Corona and the flu but both were negative. They also gave me fluids. Everything and smells and tastes terrible. They gave me Zofran but it didn&#39;t help. I haven&#39;t been able to take my medicine.

Extremely itchy eyes, palms of hands, soles of feet, progressed to shortness of breath, Bradycardic, oxygen saturation in 80s even after administration of IM epinephrin, hypotensive, swollen face, neck and tongue, severe vomiting. EMS transported me to hospital mentioned above. IV started in ambulance where IV epinephrin, IV fluids, IV Benadryl, IV solumedrol were all given prior to arrival at the ER. ER then administered more steroids and anti nausea meds and sent me home after observation and stabilization with prescription for epi pen and prednisone.

Eventually I experienced itching in the area, and today (two days later, both eyes are slightly swollen and I have areas of itching on my face and neck. I?m not experiencing any throat swelling or trouble breathing, but I thought this was a bit unusual and might be something to report. I took Benadryl on the night of the 25th and it helped some. I?m not particularly concerned, but would be interested to know if others have experienced similar symptoms and if it might be worse if I were to receive a booster some day. I did not experience any symptoms with the first dose, apart from a sore arm.

                                                About 4 hours after the vaccine, I experienced sudden nausea and abdominal pain. The symptoms lasted for about a week. They were intermittent at first. I had 3 episodes of sharp adominal pain that radiated up my back and made me short of breath. I felt pain between my shoulder blades when I tried to breathe in. The first two subsided, but the third episode on 02/16/21 was more pronounced. I felt generally unwell, like something was really wrong. I first thought it was a normal immune response or side effect. But the nausea and abdominal pain had grown worse. On 02/16/2021 I went to the ER, where a CT Scan showed I had Epiploic Appendagitis. I suspect the inflammation or a sudden ischemic event after my vaccine had caused this. I had absolutely no such symptoms prior to the vaccine, but the nausea came on exactly 4 hours after my first dose like a switch had been turned on.    In addition to the above, I experience facial flushing on the left side of my face for about 7 days after the vaccine. My forehead and right side of my face would read a normal temperature, but my left cheek averaged 101 degrees. The flushing would come on suddenly, often in the evening. I also had heart palpitations.   Other symptoms: I had the typical sore left arm for a few days. I developed joint pain on my left side, including my arm and my jaw. In general, I feel like I had a pronounced inflammatory response.

                                                I noticed a cold sensation throughout my body within 5 minutes.  It occurred suddenly and then stopped quickly.   About 25 minutes after the shot, I saw &#34;electric stars&#34; in my vision.  This has happened before (at times) so I was aware but did not worry. It lasted less than a minute. After waiting 45 mins at the facility, I left.  15 mins later (an hour after my shot), I began to cough.  This typically happens to me when I begin to react allergically.  I was driving so I pulled over to the side of the road and used my rescue inhaler (2 puffs).   Meanwhile, my doctor (also my boss) called me.  He met me at our office (allergy office) and checked on me.  I ended up having a nebulizer treatment, benadryl, allegra and prednisone.  I felt itchy about an hour after my coughing started but no visible hives.

                                                Within a 12 hours of injection I was running a fever of 101 which lasted 24 hours. Approximately the same time as the onset of fever my gums became severely inflamed  and sensitive along with my lips being numb. Although the pain has moderated the symptoms of inflammation and numbness persist to this day approximately  10 days after injection. I was seen by dentist 6 days after injection and he has shared with colleagues the situation.

                                                The morning after the injection, I woke up with a horrible rash on the bottom part of both legs (knees down).  The rash got worse throughout the day and started on my chest that evening.  By the end of the night (the day after injection), my tongue and airway appeared to be swollen and I had trouble taking full breaths.  I started taking 2 Benadryl every 4 hours. I took that dosage for the next 2 days.  The breathing got better, but the rash is still present (as of day 5 after injection).

                                                I received injection at 1332 in L arm. Within 5 minutes I began to feel tingling in the left side of my neck and the tip of my tongue was numb. I waited about 5 min to see if sx would diminish and notified clinic staff at 1344. Physician and nurse immediately responded to assess. At 1350 I looked in mirror and neck was red from L side of neck to center. As physician was again assessing symptoms we both watched the redness spread to the right side of my neck. By this time my lips were also numb and I began feeling mild full body tingling. Physician and I entered clinic and I received epi-pen injection at 1404.  The redness in neck resolved within a few minutes and the total body tingling also resolved. Nurse noted mild swelling around upper lip but it also quickly resolved after receiving epi-pen injection. EMS were called. I was evaluated by EMS and deemed stable. I had 2 epi-pens in my possession as well as Vistaril and an inhaler so I declined being treated at emergency room I left clinic at 1430. On my drive home, I noted that area above upper lip and nose were numb. I also began experiencing numbness of soft palate of roof of mouth. I arrived home shortly before 1500 and took a Pepcid and a dose of Vistaril. I reported reaction to the health department and Moderna on 3/9/21. I was evaluated by my personal physician on 3/9/21.  I continue to have numbness on tip of tongue and lips 3/10./21. Per Moderna personnel, they were unable to tell me how long to expect symptoms to last and I continue to treat with antihistamines and monitor.

                                                Almost passed out after injection. Had immediate disorientation, head pressure, ear ringing, and slight hearing loss. I stayed 1 hour after at facility . The next day disorientation was better. The head pressure was better after 2 weeks. The hearing loss has slightly improved. The ear ringing worsened significantly and is still going on now, 9 weeks later. It has improved some now after seeing an ENT ear specialist. I have been taking medicine to try to help the ear ringing for about 7 weeks. The severity of the ear ringing has gone from an 8 out of 10 in loudness to about a 2. It is not gone and may never go away.

Over the next 24-48 hours she developed painful oral lesions on the inner and outer surface of her lower lip. These were fixed lesions; some eroded and crusted over.  Presented to primary care clinic on 31DEC2020 and was diagnosed with HSV. She was prescribed a course of PO valacyclovir and topical acyclovir ointment. All lesions are now fully resolved; however, she reports resulting tingling sensation.  Reports she was feeling well on 12/28 and in the days leading up to the vaccine. No known sick contacts. Denies any previous history of HSV lesions. Reports history of acute Varicella infection in her early 20&#39;s.   Suspect this was a reactivation of HSV or VZV triggered by vaccination.

                                                I received the shot at 8:10 am and felt nothing.  As the morning progressed, I developed a sore arm, similar to a flut shot.  However, it was worse, and I also felt achy in my neck.  I drove home from work around noon, and I couldn&#39;t even use my arm on the steering wheel.  These symptoms continued and I finally took Tylenol in the middle of the afternoon, and evening going to bed.  I slept horribly and woke up feeling like a train wreck.  I took my temperature. It was 102!  I started taking the Tylenol again.  I couldn&#39;t even raise my arm, either. My arm didn&#39;t hurt if it was just still, but it would hurt if it was touched, and I could not raise it for 3 days.  Despite taking the Tylenol, I felt awful all day and really had to stay bedridden.  I was also very thirsty both the day of the vaccine and this second day.  Saturday morning I woke up feeling better, but as the day wore on, the aches and fever came back.  Sunday was the same as Saturday.  Monday was similar, but better overall.  Today is Tuesday.   My arm still feels a little weird and I cannot completely raise it. I did have the COVID-19 back in March and have antibodies, as far as I know as I have donated to Red Cross 4 times.

Over the next 30 minutes, I felt the same in my lower lip and cheeks.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl at that time.  I slept for nearly 20 hours after that.  On Friday, I experienced severe body aches from head to toe.  I felt somewhat better Saturday.  I woke up Sunday with nausea and dizziness that lasted all day and evening.  I woke up feeling better Monday morning but noticed 2 enlarged lymph nodes above my collar bone and pain from my R deltoid, across my shoulder and into my lower neck.  It is Tuesday and and the lymph nodes are painful to touch and I&#39;m experiencing 5/10 pain in my upper arm, shoulder R side and back of neck and above my R scapula.  I am considering calling my PCP.

                                                The day of the vaccine I just felt a little tired but the next morning I felt extremely tired, joint/body aches and chills. I also had fever and called my PCP and told them what was going on they suggested me to take Tylenol (100.2F) 500mg my doctor told me to take 600mg. The fever started going down. At night I took 1000mg and the fever went away I still felt very drained, tired and the next day as well. I did not go to work because of that.  I have a mild pain on my neck, close to my spine cord and also I have a sore throat now. I also don&#39;t have sense of smell and my face is painful/sore - my doctor told me that my sinus cavities are all inflamed and that is why it is painful. Not sure if the vaccine made it worse or not, but it is happening.  I also am having dry eyes for about a week and a half and it feels like I have &#34;light&#34; coming out of my eyes.  Specially when I am in front of a computer for a long time. It is not double vision, it is like a &#34;hologram light(?)&#34; a colorful light coming from my eyes. It is also painful.  About ten min after I took the vaccine I felt a &#34;medicine taste&#34; in my mouth, and in the back of my throat/tongue and that is when my throat started feeling scratchy/sore. I had Covid on 05/18/2020 (positive)

The next day I woke up extremely tired, felt like I had dry eyes and some weird color/light coming out of them. I had fever (102F) that is when I called my PCP for a televisit consultation.  They told me to take Tylenol. I took it and by night after taking 1000mg dose I started feeling better.  I still felt extremely tired when I woke up the next day and that is why I did not go to work. I had covid in 05/2020 ( positive on 05/18/20).

I also noticed a quarter size red, warm, tender spot at injection site of my left arm on  the 9th day after receiving the vaccine.  12 hours later it had spread to be about 3 inches in diameter. Still warm and tender to the touch.  No improvement today (day 10).

I was kept at the facility extra time (around 40 minutes in total) and left with a friend to return about an hour or so later to drive home.   I did not have any difficulty breathing but did have some rashy/redness on my chest but that is not unusual for me when I am having any kind of distress.  The other s/s were not typical for me.

                                                The patient had gone shopping in the store after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and then returned to the pharmacy after about 10 minutes saying she wasn&#39;t feeling well. She reported feeling hot, that her lips were tingling, and stating she just felt weird. I had her sit in the immunization booth so I could tend to her without and audience. I gave her 10 ml of Benadryl because she mentioned her lips were tingling. I broke one of the instant icepacks for her and had her place it on the back of her neck and put her head between her knees. She reported feeling that her face felt hot, so I broke two more icepacks and had her sit up right and place the ice packs on the front of her neck. I stayed with her in the booth and talked to her until she felt better. I set the timer on my phone for 15 minutes. After 10 minutes she said she was feeling better and wanted to move to the waiting area. She was fine after the full 15 minutes and left our store. I estimate she remained in the store for approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

                                                24 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up feeling tired, with chills, joints, and muscle aches. It started to get better 3 days after, but it didn&#39;t go completely back to my normal, and I am already on the 10th day after the vaccine. Today I woke up again with chills, joint, and muscle aches, and I am having cough, sniffle, watery eyes, and sneezing.  Since I have asthma and allergies in this period of the year, it wouldn&#39;t be a surprise, but the fatigue, chills, feeling sleepy, and body aches, make me wonder if this is still related to the vaccination, or it could be that I was unfortunately infected with COVID roughly at the same time  I got the shot?  I had to stay for 15 minutes at the vaccine place, there were other people, we were 6 feet apart, but the room was not well ventilated, so who knows.

I was fine until about 20 minutes ?? it started with red spots around  my chin and bottom of my face. The spots changed to numbness within about 5 minutes.  It scared me so I drove to hospital parking lot and called my cousin who is a nurse and I took vistaril and benadryl that I had in my purse and vehicle. My symptoms continued for 12 hours. I did contact the health department and they said take benadryl and go to er.

                                                I began experiencing severe tinnitus about 9 days after my first Moderna vaccine dose. Very loud electronic hissing tone throughout my head. This has not subsided since March 22. It is ongoing, 24 hours a day. This produced distress, discomfort, and anxiety. I went to the ER at Hospital on March 22 due to the sudden tinnitus onset and the accompanying anxiety. They gave me referrals for an audiologist, PCP, and psychiatrist. At the hospital, they gave me Ativan.  The tinnitus is very uncomfortable, scary, loud, and disruptive. I&#39;ve had two separate audiologists test my hearing and examine my ears and both are fine. Nothing remarkable. I&#39;ve also had an MRI done with normal results. I&#39;ve been to my PCP, another doctor at the same clinic, and an ENT doctor. I also went to a psychiatric physician&#39;s assistant. No one seems to know the cause or what to do. I&#39;ve been prescribed 20 mg of fluoxetine daily, o.5 mg alprazolam as needed for distress. Also prescribed, 25 mg amitriptyline, and 50mg trazodone to help sleep. The trazodone had no effect so I stopped it. Also prescribed a 6-day course of methylprednisolone, but I had to stop on the third day because it kept me up for almost three days, so I stopped. I&#39;m also taking daily Zyrtec, Benadryl, generic multi-symptom allergy medication, 2000mg Vitamin C, B12, and two Chinese herbs. I&#39;ve also been seeing a chiropractor 3 x a week. I&#39;ve seen a craniosacral therapist once and will start acupuncture this Sat.

Her right eye then started to swell around 2 pm and she began to have difficulty talking and swallowing. She was not short of breath but felt like her throat was tightening. She arrived to work at 2:50 pm and informed her boss who sent her to the employee health department. She reported having oral Benadryl and  was going to take that. Anesthesiology evaluated her, felt it was a progressive allergic reaction, and recommended evaluation at an urgent care or ED. She later developed hives, her lower lip became swollen.  She was later evaluated at Emergency Department. She will be able to provide you with information on the doctor, treatment. She was prescribed a course of prednisone and will have allergy testing scheduled. MD indicated uncertain if caused by vaccine.   She missed work on 1/6 due to the ongoing reaction which had improved.

They said no ear infection and started me on Eye drops with steroids but could not get them until Monday around 5pm.  Corners of mouth started cracking open as well.  Monday started steroid drops. Wednesday eyes were much worse and felt like glass in them.  called Dr.  She said to stop steroid drops and go back to antihistamine drops and start Claritin.  Started immediately and I started putting Ivarest in my ears. Eyes have stopped oozing but are still red.  Ears are clearing up and not as sore.  Mouth is starting to clear up

My skin and joints felt inflamed and very hot. The injection arm was untouchable and hurt badly for 48 hrs.  The pain was close to excruciating.  It hurt to move it hurt to stay still.  I moaned and cried in pain.   I treated it with motrin and Tylenol alternately. I felt a little relief sat at 2pm then it kicked back in around 6pm sat night.  Through sun and Mon the pain faded a little at a time and I still get shooting pain into my joints.  My insides were so raw I acquired a scratch down the back of my throat and probably esophagus that is still blistered and I can taste the ulcerations.  I have never had a reaction to flu or other vaccines.  I expected achey etc but this was a little extreme!  I had blood on my qtips this morning from my ears. &#34; Advised to contact PCP ASAP.

                                                15 minutes after administration patient described her lips as feeling &#34;sunburned&#34; and that the tip of her tongue felt &#34;tingly&#34;.  She denied any rash, feeling of swelling in her throat or tongue and had no trouble breathing. Patient declined to have EMTs called because she did not feel it was anaphylaxis.  A dose of 50mg of Benadryl was via orally and she was closely monitored.  Her blood preassure was 128/84 and heart rate was 80.  She had offers to drive her to either the ER or urgent care but declined saying it was isolated to her lips and the tip of her tongue.  Patient is a nurse and was aware of what to watch for.  Pharmacy staff continued to observe her for an additional 45 minutes.  At that time she said the issues were resolving and she would like to go home.  She was counseled on what to look for with worsening reaction but said she felt more frustrated that anything.  Pharmacist encouraged her to reach out to her PCP and also explained we would be unable to give her the next shot at a clinic.  She was advised to speak more with her doctor regarding if she should get a second dose.  Patient was followed up with 2 hours after vaccination by phone and reported symptoms resolved and she was just tired from the Benadryl.  Patient was also called the day after and said she had a bad headache but otherwise no other signs of adverse reaction.

It felt like I had received 1,000 flu shots.    I used and ice pack to the inj site and took Advil.  The following day, 1/16/21 these symptoms continued and I also had a metal taste in my mouth.    By Sun. 1/17/21 the chills had stopped.  I was still experiencing low energy level, the muscle pain was gone BUT, I started having severe breast pain in my right upper breast area which is opposite from the injection arm.  The breast pain continued until Fri. 1/22/21.  I was due for a mammogram and was able to get one Thurs. 1/21/21.  These results are still pending.

Could not hear out of right ear on Jan. 9 at 5:00 pm.  By 7:00 pm I had excruciating pain in right ear and went to the ER.  I was on Amoxicillin from Jan. 9-Jan. 22.  I still had little to no hearing in right ear.  On Jan. 22, the ENT diagnosed me with a moderate/severe conductive and sensorineural hearing loss with nerve damage.  I had a ventilation tube placed in right ear on Jan.22 and placed on steroids to try to recover some hearing loss.  I will follow up with the ENT in two weeks. Not sure yet if this is permanent damage.

Pain got less as each day went on and subsided a few days later. Sore throat a few days later in glands area but only lasted a day. Sciatic nerve flared up afterwards...still dealing with that and it&#39;s 2 weeks later but I have had issues with that before: still tired but not as tired, ears bothering me and some nasal congestion but not unusual for this time of year.

                                                Five in a half hours after vaccine ,vaccinated arm became more sore, soreness traveled up arm to fingers and spread to rest of arm and body as time passed.  Body aches progressed and became more intense, went to bed.  Was unable to sleep, had a left ear ache and neck ache that intensified as the night went on.  I was unable to move at all in bed, I was sweating and in SEVERE  pain I was finally was able to crawl out of bed at 5:30 and took some aspirin.  The aspirin only took the edge off for a few hours as I tried to sleep,the ear ache and the headache intensified.  If I would of had a pain killer I would have taken it, as I was in so much body ache pain.  Stayed in bed all day until the evening and continued to take aspirin every 4-6 hours, used a heating pad and pushed water.  Applied CBD ointment which helped quite a bit.  Every hour that passed in the evening the intense pain would subside a bit and by 8:30 pm I started to feel like I was feeling back to normal.

                                                Over the past 10 years I have occasionally experienced bouts of epischleritis which last approximately two days and responds well to ibuprofen.  One week after receiving the vaccine I experienced the most severe flare up to date.  My left eye was completely red, swollen and painful.  Two days later my right eye also flared up.  This episode has lasted 8 days and counting.  There has been minimal refief using ibuprofen and I have had to add ice packs to help relieve the swelling and pain.   As this condition is caused by inflammation I believe there may be a connection.

Had to work in a dark office to even see the computer screen.  Day 3 blurriness subsided but not totally gone.  Still have some blurriness but think it may be due to dosage change on Chlorthaladone in late Dec. Both shots really seemed to target my eyes since I was having issues there any way

                                                On the 3rd - I started noticing my left eye swollen; on the 5th day day it felt weird - and it&#39;s getting bigger. My voice changed like a horse - hoarse throat. And when I swallowed it was like a piece of food in my throat. At work, my left eye is swollen  and my lower lip was swollen too and they took me to patient room at work and examined me. Asked me to go home from work and my husband took me to ED  on January 5th- I had gotten hives - started feeling itchy all over my body. At Emergency room they gave me Prednisone to stop the swelling. My throat was swollen and they gave me blood tests, too. Prednisone helped some - took that for one week. (Still missed work on the sixth because my eyes were still swollen.) Had a previously scheduled doctor appt for something else and my doctor told me the hives will come back after Prednisone so he told me to take Claritin for two weeks. All my symptoms resolved after that.

My hearing was effected as my right ear felt like it had a cotton ball in it. I immediately knew it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine injection. I presented to the Emergency Room @ 2:40 pm.  I was seen my Dr.  I was given 10 mg of steriod and Benadryl.  I was evaluated for 3 hours and discharged with Diphenydramine 25 mg script. The swelling decreased 2 days later.

Worst part was, I had like a tingling and burning sensation that radiated to my extremities legs and feet. Sweating in feet that came in waves. I felt like my skin was on fire, like I was too close to a heater. Waves of numbness and tingling that was constant that lasted for approximated 5 days. Bad taste in mouth like a metallic taste. Blood pressure was extremely high. Worse at night. I went to ER on 1/3/21, because I was still having waves of burning and discomfort that was raising my blood pressure. I thought after 72 hours I would be better and it did not so this is why I went to ER.  Day 5, I had lost of taste, runny nose, light nausea. By day 6, the cough turned into itchy throat discomfort. Day 7 low grade fever. Day 8, everything started to subside.

Rash went away.  SOB lasted off and on for several days. Heart rate was off when I was working out for a couple of weeks.  I work out  so we wear heart rate monitors.  Heart rate did not recover as quickly as normal during my workouts. Took a couple of weeks for this to get back to normal for me.  Just really felt &#34;off&#34; for awhile and not like myself.  Did not feel comfortable getting second shot because of the above symptoms.

The symptom that concerns me most that I&#39;d not heard about or expect was a neurological tingly twitchy feeling in my head, neck, and throat area.  On day one, I did feel a subtle tingling in my throat/chest area.  It was more noticeable  on day 2 with about 4 or 5 neurologically-twitchy-feeling events.  Day 3, which is today, is particularly noticeable, feeling ongoing.

Patient stated that her husband was home, very close by, and that he was a nurse practitioner and that he was going to monitor her at home.  Patient purchased Benadryl liquid and Claritin tablets.

All mild and expected as possible side effects.  No concerns.  Symptoms continued and by 1/5; all symptoms had move to severe level and are still occurring today 1/8.  Temperature spikes to 102.8; chills, severe headache especially in eye sockets, body aches, and heaviness in chest.  Could not work on 1/7 and only for a bit on 1/8 (working from home).  Became concerned and was flu and covid tested on 1/7;  both negative.  I was retested for Covid on 1/8 and still negative.  I am not sure if maybe I am sick with something else and this is coincidence or if I am just experiencing issues from the vaccine that are a little different from others?

Usual &amp; expected solicited SEs: fatigue, soreness, feeling &#34;off,&#34; transient headache, chills sx Day 2- strong R arm pain, cannot lift R arm.  Metallic taste in mouth and tingling tongue persists.  Also same usual Sx as day 1 plus mild nausea.   Felt really crummy.   Day 3- Still moderately strong R arm pain, can only partially lift arm over head, cannot straighten over head.   Strong fatigue continues, mild nausea.   By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

The rash has finally quit spreading. I have bruises mixed in with the rash. I finally got an in-person appointment with a doctor tomorrow.

                                                The patient received her COVID19 vaccination, the Moderna mRNA vaccine, on Friday, January 8, 2020 at 10 AM.  She developed some low-grade fevers and fatigue over the next 24 hours, treated with ibuprofen.  However, by Saturday evening, as her fever was slowly improving, she developed some puffiness of her eyes.  The swelling progressed further on Sunday accompanied by low-grade fever and by Monday affecting both eyelids, upper as well as lower, with a burning sensation and some pruritus.  She has noted some desquamation of her skin in that area.  She comes into the office today because of persistent swelling.  She denies any respiratory or throat complaints.  She also states that she has a dry spot on the right side of her mouth, started on Sunday afternoon.  She has not used any fillers and has not had any cosmetic procedures done on her face.   She did develop chondrodermatitis to retinol-A in 2018.  She states that she does have sensitive skin and has used hypoallergenic items intermittently.  She prefers not to place cosmetics on her skin.  She is currently using Victoria&#39;s secret Eau so sexy lotion once every other week, typically on her cheeks.  She did use this cosmetic on Sunday on her cheeks, after she developped the swelling of her eyelids.   She does not receive further vaccinations due to personal preferences.  She did receive a Kenalog injection 2018 in her first MTP.  That ingestion contained polysorbitol 80.  She did not have an adverse reaction to the injection.   She was sick with Covid November 2020, diagnosed via positive PCR swab at the urgent care as per patient.

                                                within 30 seconds I had a cooling sensation rush across the tip of my tongue, then a sweet taste, then more identifiable as bubble gum flavored.  By 12:45 I noticed I was scratching several areas of my body. Arms, legs, chest, neck, back and scalp and kept clearing my throat.  I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

                                                the reaction began about 45 minutes after Moderna vaccine. I began to notice tingling in my hands and feet first. My right foot felt a little stiff when picking it up from the gas to the break while driving home. I noticed shortly after I arrived home itching and tingling all over and more pronounced picking, burning, numbness in my mouth(tongue and chin), hands and feet,  No rash, no shortness of breath. I took a Benadryl hoping just a mild reaction that would clear up. Next morning my feet and hands woke me up from the tingling and cramping. Other symptoms off and on were spasms in my feet and pain in index and middle fingers when touching cold. I called my doctor on Monday morning to get in for an appointment after I was awakened with some cramping in my calves and was more concerned. Was told if it worsened or I had any SOB or weakness in extremities to go to the ER. My reflexes were checked and normal and no weakness in my muscles. No other tests done at that time. The symptoms persist with buzzing feeling in them off and on, feeling of stiffness and stabbing feeling on occasion, no more cramps in calves. It remains mostly ankles to feet but some numbness to below knees. Hands, no further than wrist, along with chin and tongue remain numb and tingling at times.

All these symptoms lasted for the whole night but did not get any worse though.

                                                Vaccine given at work left arm on Friday 1:45 pm and felt like tight Blood Pressure cuff  on my arm within 30 mins. This was constant pressure that lasted until I slept that night.  went home after work, ate dinner, then sleep with my CPAP. Slept late, woke up 1:40pm with entire left arm numb, but still able to move it. (sleeping on right side) and numb tongue that felt swollen. Stroke?  I got up and as time progressed over next 30 mins or so, I started coughing more, felt like sore throat, itchy, having trouble clearing my throat, some trouble breathing, tongue didn&#39;t look swollen, but it felt like scotch tape underneath my tongue with someone slowly pulling tape off. with top of tongue swollen and heavy.  2:25pm I took 25 mg Benadryl oral tablet and called 24/7 RN hotline and was told to go to ER and take another 25 mg Benadryl tablet which I did. I arrived at ER and was really coughing hacking repeatedly. Short of breath, kept trying to clear my throat. Seen in triage. No meds given, this was? &lt;20 from time I took Benadryl.  About an hour later I did have about 15 mins of feeling like I was wearing a very snug neck turtleneck with 2 brief cool sensations going down the middle of my throat and down both sides of my upper chest.   I felt better when I kept my neck very straight versus looking down.  I was later seen again and felt 75% better, given Dexamethasone and Pepcid.  Discharged home. around 6:30pm.  Took Benadryl 50 mg again 10 pm same night.

About 20 minutes later that sensation moved up to my shoulder. 10 minutes later moved up the left side of my neck.  It continued to move up and stayed in face, especially lips.  That lasted 30 minutes.  It then moved to include my right nostril, it became stuffy and started to run.    No respiratory distress.  About 45 minutes later the sensation went in my right eye and made it difficult to move it, at this time I also experienced a lot of pain in upper front teeth.  I took Tylenol for the pain. Sensation continued in lips, R nostril, and R eye; along with teeth pain until 6 hours later. After which the numbness in lips lingered for 15 hours total.

I went home and within 1 hour after the shot my ears seemed get clogged and itchy.  My upper lip swelled up enough for me to feel it and notice while looking in the mirror then my throat seemed to get thick. I did not have difficulty breathing.  I drank  a lot of ice cold water and took a benadryl which seemed to halt the symptoms.  I woke up the next day and all seemed to be better.

On or about 7pm that same day I started having pain and occasional itching around injection site. Upon assessing area I noticed a 1/2 dollar sized redness, warm to touch that was raised and very tender to touch. Later that night around about 2:40am I was awakened with a headache that has been constant since then. Around or about 5am I started feeling generalized malaise and aching joints including eye sockets. Aching is mild to moderate about a 4-5 on pain scale.  Low grade temperature of 99.7F

                                                MODERNA COVID19 Vaccine EUA I took my shot on Friday at 1:15pm I had tingling on the roof of my mouth for 2 hours starting about an hour after the shot; this resolved by itself w/o any medication. The tingling (and a bit of discomfort like my mouth had a sunburn) returned about 8 hours after the shot and was accompanied by mild throat swelling (no issues with breathing or any other symptoms). I did a tele-med visit and was instructed to self-medicate at home with Benadryl (50mg) which helped; I took benadryl to lesson the reaction for about 24 hours (q6 hr).   Other than these reactions, I was super tired until day 4  and had a slight discomfort where I had the shot on day two.

But in an instant my tongue got all tingly like your arm when it falls asleep -- and I lost my taste buds. It came back the next day when all the aches left as well.  I was diagnosed with covid a few months ago and am aware of the symptoms and lost my taste buds then as well.

                                                Within 30 minutes I noticed my neck felt funny.  By the time I got home my face was tingly and my tongue was numb.   I did not even think about it being a reaction to the shot.  I took some Benadryl and a beta blocker because my heart was racing.   I laid down and about an hour later it was better.   I checked with my pcp dr.  She recommended that I take Benadryl before the next dose and ordered an epipen.   I have had anaphalxis previously due to a mango allergy.   I took the Benadryl before and was very nervous.  Eskenazi was amazing.  They assigned me a special watch person and kept me for 30 min.  I felt a little funny.... tingly face and my tongue was not normal.  When I got home I took a second Benadryl and a nap and then felt fine.

I sent photos to my PCP and eye doctor who both said it was conjunctiva hemorrhage. I feel a bit of pressure behind that eye. It is not consistent with conjunctivitis. I have never had this before. .

                                                On 12/25 after the vaccination I started feeling very fatigued and on the 26th and throughtout the next 3 days I had a low grade temp, body aches were mild that affected my knee joint but just a little, periodic taste loss, loose stool and the color change in the BM for 3 days.  I had a virtual visit on the 28th and got tested and got the results on the 12/29 and was positive for COVID-19.  I went to the ER on 1/3 because I just wasnt feeling well and was advised my bone marrow were throwing off immature white blood cells. And after about 8 or 9 days is when I finally began to get some relief an symptoms began to resolve.

That night I had severe left arm soreness to the point where I needed a narcotic, I had some at home. The pain woke me up. The next day I was more tired and had a stomach ache and more fatigue, left arm sore took Tylenol, fluids and did not call my doctor. Went to bed with a narcotic. Sunday into Monday 1/9 -1/10 I had severe diarrhea and could not eat, sore throat, muscle aches, decreased left arm soreness.  Full relief by Thursday.

                                                From Dec 26-29, 2020, I had injection site pain. On Jan 4, 2021, I had ear pain and it went away in two days. On Jan 7, 2021, I had mild pain on my armpit and left shoulder (Note: my left shoulder had an injury ~ 3 years ago. However, it only has pain now and then when the weather is cold or on rainy days). The pain on my armpit went away on Jan 15, 2021.   The mild pain in my left shoulder is still there. On Jan 9, 2021, I got a ~8 cm in diameter BCG-like rash with induration on the edges. I took Claritin one time a day for six days, and alternate Tylenol and Motrin every 12 hours for six days. It got better on Jan 12, 2021. Now the rash is almost gone.

On the next day, noticed about a 3 inch wide (across) and 1 inch long (head to toe) redness with a hard lump in my left arm/where the injection site was. Redness and hardness took about 3-4 days to resolve and my arm had a deep itch to it as the redness resolved. On 01/06/21 arm redness returned with the itching  with some itching of my face and head but resolved in a couple of days.

I had had irritated eyes since having covid (diagnosed on Nov 17, fairly ill) so I am not sure if had iritis before, but definitely became more symptomatic after getting vaccine, formally seen by OD on Jan 25 and diagnosed with iritis of both eyes, right greater than left. I also had symptoms post vaccine x 3 days of chills, headache, myalgias, nausea and diarrhea (same symptoms I had with covid). Treatment for iritis ocular steroids, treatment ongoing.

                                                About 10 min after vaccine felt fuzzy around my neck and alerted the vaccinator. I was exhorted to a curtained room where vitals were checked. I was given Benadryl 25mg and salumedrol IV. Before the 30 min mark I had tingling on the tip of my tongue and lips. I was monitored for 2&#43; hours and was sent home. The doctor prescribed 40mg prednisone for 4 days an Epipen, and antihistamines, recommended I see an allergist.  I saw APN 1/18/21 after the tingling and throat tightness persisted, she prescribed a taper of the prednisone.  Went to allergist 1/21/21 where we discussed continued symptoms and longer taper of prednisone and she asked me to call her 1/25/21. We spoke 1/25/21 and she recommended I see an ENT. Saw ENT on 1/29/21 who examined my throat with no concerns there. We discussed the ?burning mouth syndrome? symptoms and he recommended I return for medicated mouth wash if the symptoms continue. I am no longer taking any medication. I still have mild tingling on the lips and tongue, slight peppery feel/taste and occasional tightness at the base of my throat. We

I thought i was having a brain aneurysm.   My ears started ringing at that time (Tinnitus). I thought is was just because I had the headache, but  it has been three weeks now and it has not stopped, even for a moment.  I have never had tinnitus before.

The taste was there just long enough for me to notice the metallic taste and then it was gone.  I had no other adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I did have the muscle aches and fatigue that been documented as common side effects post-vaccination but those eased after about 36 hours. I searched online for &#34;metallic taste&#34; but was unable to find any information as to whether this is an expected side effect, hence my reporting it now.

                                                Woke up at 5:30am on Feb. 22, 2021 with my arm itching only at the site of the shot on my left arm. Very red and had heat in it. Experienced head ache with sharp pains in various locations inside my head the day before. As of 1:10pm on the same day, the redness is still there and is warm to touch. No swelling appears to be at the site.   I did not have any side effects of the shot at any other time other than tasting a sweet taste in the back of my throat 2 minutes  after being given the shot. It went away by the time I was released from vaccine location.

On day 2 my lips began to swell and were itchy, by day 3 they were very swollen, took benadryl every 8 hrs and by day 5 today they are fairly normal but still sore. My arm also swelled and spread to arm pit and was very hot and red. The redness has mostly gone, the swelling has lessened but not gone. Still sore and itchy. Still pretty run down and no energy. My cousin and I live together and were vaccinated at the same time and both had these symptoms except the lips swelling.

It felt like pins and needles. When it went on for several hours I called Hospital and they advised to contact them if it worsened of I began having symptoms of Bells Palsey or a stroke (not concerning at all!)  I took tylenol then ibuprofen and it went away. It&#39;s come back two more days (up to today) but has not worsened. Just thought I should report it.

Day 4 pain in left arm grew to more intense pain and spread up left shoulder to neck and left side of face and around eye area. Same exact feeling as Bell&#39;s Palsy.  Day 5 - I took Valtrex I already had 1 gm Day 6-13 doctor prescribed Prednisone 60 mg &#43; Valtrez 1 gm for first day (adjusted to 50 mg Prednisone days 7-12 due to Prednisone side effects, then 20 mg on day 13).   After day 7 facial palsy began to decrease in eye area. Overall Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms after full course of treatment have finally subsided after day  20, for now.  Hoping they will not return.  Very scary and intense experience.  Exercise and PT helpful.

                                                First was arm pain which started within a couple hours of injection. Shoulder pain, neck pain and muscle cramping followed. The next morning headache and lethargy and a feeling that something was not normal but nothing out of the ordinary and I thought I was lucky until 10 am (16 hours after injection) I had chills with violent shaking and could not get warm (temp never went above 100) not matter how many blankets or heating pads. Stomach upset and diarrhea. Loss of appetite and taste buds off. Severe headache (like an explosion)   with sensitivity to light and sound. Muscle cramps, joint pain and lethargy. Inability to get warm. Some symptoms still persisting 4 days later. No bruise this time and arm pain is less severe than first injection which several nurses looked at an think the first shot went too deep.

                                                6 days after receiving the vaccination, I started to display symptoms related to COVID.  I was tested 8 days after receiving the vaccination and was positive for COVID. The symptoms I had in order of appearance were chills, fever, body aches, fatigue, chest heaviness,  diarrhea, loss of smell, loss of taste, congestion,  sore throat,  and cough.  I never experienced headache, nausea, or a drop in oxygen levels.  Approximately 12 days after receiving the vaccination I had a raised, red, irregularly-shaped rash around the sit of the injection.  The rash was warm and firm to the touch.  It disappeared about 4 days after I first noticed it.

At about 9:30pm I had chills and fever-like symptoms all night. Body aches, headache, blurred vision and my teeth really hurt (a common fever symptom for me) I was tossing and turning all night and woke up at 3:30am,  shot up straight in bed and said, &#34;Freedom!&#34; (Ha, not sure if that was related to a dream? Weird for me! Hee.) I was feeling nauseous at that point and made myself some butter toast and was able to keep it down. Called in sick the next day and the symptoms started to dissapate around 3:30 pm the day after my shot. But, it was a rough time. Had a bit of stomach cramping and slight diahrrea the following day, as well.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID19 Moderna on 4/2/21 @7:40  through my employer, where I&#39;ve worked over 11 years. By that evening, I had the normal fatigue, headache, and sore arm at my injection site that evening which even became swollen, red, and rashy by that next morning with some joint pain but attributed to normal side effects and dismissed it. But I woke up early Sunday morning, 04:30, very sick, with a fever, chills, diarrhea, cramping and aching abdomen and joints and also developed a rash and hives on my arm, up my neck, into my hair and down my chest left chest with some swelling as well. I took some Benadryl, it went down some but continued but I called the Tele service line to be evaluated as my symptoms were getting worse, not better. I continued experiencing these side effects as they increased intensity, especially the watery diarrhea that occured almost immediately everytime I drank and the rash and hives and ache in joints. I lost all appetite and even got so nauseas it woke me from a 10 minute nap vomitingI had an appointment w/MD 04/06/2021where she prescribed Zofran and told me to take Imodium, which I did not think I could since I was told nothing but Tylenol after the vaccine.She told me to follow -up with my primary or ER if I wasn&#39;t better by Thursday, today, but didn&#39;t think my diarrhea and stomach had anything to do with my vaccine.My fever, chills, rash, hives and itchiness came back and continued throughout yesterday as soon as I tried to stop taking Benadryl and Tylenol for a day as my stomach was so upset, cramping and sore. I went online to request an appointment with my PMD for follow-up and further evaluation as I am still nauseous too, and as I discovered after trying to eat toast and rice again, my taste is off.I received no response to my requests online so I called my doctors office today and they made a special appointment by telephone @08:30pm with Dr. so I do not have to come into the Clinic and get others sick.I&#39;ve had to submit a LOA claim as well from missing now what will be 5 days of work. I hoping to be better soon.

The nurse could see me turning red and feel the heat on my body. My BP and HR were also high. After those symptoms started leaving I became extremely cold. My hands stayed so cold they could not get a reading on my oxygen level. I did not feel short of breath at any time. I had a total of 4 episodes like this with each one being smaller and leaving sooner. They gave me juice and a graniola bar, kept checking my temp and blood pressure. After an hour to hour and half I was released to my son and husband. I took a benedryl whenI left.

Slightly warm and SUPER itchy. Day 9: Injection site still red, although slightly less so, slightly warm , and barely itchy.

I am not sure if this is related to the vaccine or just that i might have covid but I got tested this morning at the drive thru testing.  I will get my results in 2-3 days.  I have not received any other treatment as of this morning I am not having anything but the lost of smell and still congested.

                                                woke on 1/9/2021 with a cold sore on lt side of upper lip. Treated with topical Denivir ointment as I have before. By 12Noon, I noticed my left upper lip had swollen quite a bit, and then then swelling progressed across my entire upper lip, and then outward to my bilateral cheeks, and upward to my nasal area and to my bilateral orbits. My left side was worse then my right. the progression occurred over the course of Jan 9th and again Jan 10th, but as it progressed outward, it subsided slowly from where it started (my upper lip)

I stayed for about 20 minutes more, and returned to my office. Throughout the day changing sensations/lip area-that evening, my family said my lower lip was  drooping slightly downward-it seemed a bit swollen as well.  I checked in with the Covid Vaccine Clinic Wed. 01/13/20 in the AM as asked, and let them know i was still having symptoms in my lips, and felt slightly swollen on the one side.

At 25 minutes, my heart rate increased in the chair,, the tip of my tongue began to tingle. When I stood up to alert a staff member, my head began to &#39;swim&#39;, like it was full of water. My speech became slow and I couldn&#39;t quite find the words to speak quickly to answer the staff&#39;s questions. My walking was slow and wobbly. Staff took me to a secluded room, where vitals were taken four different times throughout my seclusion. My b/p was high at first, I was dizzy and not thinking clearly. It took until 10:55 A.M. before my tongue tip no longer tingled, but became numbish, and my head became clearer. I was able to stand on my own, and then walk out to my car.

Next dose scheduled for 1/22 and do not want to take it until I get official direction on what needs to be done proactively and after the next vaccine to ensure my safety.

She consulted with the nurse administering the vaccine and decided it would be okay to leave the vaccination site.  She reported that the dry spot on the back of her throat became more prominent and it was more difficult to swallow around an hour after receiving the vaccine.   She decided to go to the ER as a precaution because she lives far from the hospital.  At the ER they gave her 75 mg of Benadryl and 15 mg of prednisone.  Her symptoms resolved following the medications.

Developed a delayed reaction to the vaccine 12 days after receiving  it.  Developed a rash that is approxiamently 3.5 inches wide by  5 inches in length.  It is dark in color and raised as well as itchy.  I am also experiencing tingling in my tongue and lips as well as feeling that my tongue is slightly swollen as well as my throat.   The rash is warm to the touch and slightly sensitive to touch as well, and is  giving off heat.  It has gotten slightly larger in the past 2 days.  I DO NOT have a fever. Monday evening started taking Allegra.  It helps to keep the reaction I am having in my mouth and the itchiness for about 12 hours

I was made to wait 30 min  for monitoring  and left the site at approximately 2:10 because the arm issue appeared to have subsided .   As I was half way home - 10 /15 min later, I began to feel tingling of my lips and tongue; soon after that I felt swelling  at the back of my throat and tongue. It was difficult to swallow saliva but did not have issues breathing.  I took a Zyrtec as soon as I got home,  I started to feel the swelling subside about 20-30 min after. I took an additional benadryl  as I still had difficulty swallowing and felt some swelling.  It is now 4:30 pm and my throat and tongue are feeling  more normal now.

                                                I got my vaccine at 3pm, I felt fine the entire afternoon, somewhere around 6 r 7 pm my arm hurt it was sore. It was not red, it was not swollen, it was just sore. I decided to take a bath, and went to bed. Felt tired and my arm was sore but it was mild, around 8 or 9 o&#39;clock.  I went to bed at 8 or 9 o&#39;clock and woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning and arm was very sore, would call it moderate. I took 500 Tylenol and 200 ibuprofen together.  Throughout the night my head hurt and i tried to go back to sleep. at 5 in the morning my head was excruciating, I would it an 8. My arm was very sore, I would give it an 8. My body hurt really bad so i give that an 8. so I&#39;m thinking ok this is what you get when you get a vaccine so I went back to bed. from 5-8 am  tossed and turned. at 8 o&#39;clock i got up and was very wobbly and weak and had chills. I checked my temp and it was 101.5. I went down stairs but had to take one stairs at a time because I was so weak, I went to kitchen because I was so thirsty. I tried to fix some ice water and lemon but it spilled. Went back upstairs because I had so many chills. I called my job at the Clinic but all they had was a voicemail. My face hurts my jaw hurts and my neck on the side where they gave me the shot, my right side. I was trying to put something in my stomach but I could only eat a few sunflower seeds. My body head and arm hurts so bad, moving is excruciating. I felt great all week and yesterday.

Took 25 mg benadryl and Proair inhaler. Feeling of throat tightness started to relieve within 20 minutes. No further problem with the throat tightness after that. Asthma flared slightly after injection but controlled with routine asthma meds.

Thought I was tired so went to bed. Woke up the next morning (Monday) to severe dizziness, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision. Went to ER and was diagnosed with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Was given Zofran and prescription strength Meclizine and sent home. Spent two days sleeping it off. Better on second day but still slightly dizzy. Much better on third day. I had never had Vertigo prior to this.

                                                1/6 vaccination By 7pm, my nose started running. Odd for me to happen. I kept blowing nose. Eventually, eyes started to water, little bit of a cough, no fever.  The main reason calling Dr. was because I didn&#39;t want to feel that way for my mothers funeral. I wanted a clear head. My nose would not stop for 2.5-3 weeks. By 3 weeks, all symptoms were gone. Slight sore throat. Felt like I had a dry patch in my throat. On the back of my tongue, if felt like a scratchy patch. Every time I would swallow, it would scratch back of my throat.  Dr. didnt prescribe any medication. I took Zycam which helped with nose dripping but still had feeling back in my throat.

                                                About 36 hours after the injection I woke up with swollen dry cracked lips.  The swelling did not effect my breathing or airway.  I did not need immediate attention. I took an antihistamine for 3 days.  On day 3 I went to an urgent care.  The PA felt it was a reaction and suggested taking a Pepcid as well as the zyrtec.  It cleared up on 2/18.  On Wednesday 2/24 at about 8 pm I noticed my lips were starting to swell again.  I took a zyrtec and a pepcid.  I woke up on 2/25. My lips were very swollen and itchy and red and the area around my lips were very red.  I did not feel any breathing issues.  I went to an urgent care.  They felt it was a delayed reaction to the vaccine and gave me a shot of prednisone and I took 25mg of Benedryl.

The required post injection 15 minute wait expired without incident and I got in the car to drive home. Ten minutes into the drive my face started tingling, my lips went numb and throat started hurting. At NO time did I have breathing difficulties.  I got home, called the site where I got the vaccine, and reported the reaction.  Over the next hour, I developed a headache, my ears were itching and my tongue went completely numb and my throat felt numb when swallowing. It was progressing enough that I took 50mg of Benadryl and within the hour my reaction completely resolved.

                                                Thursday after walking down 2 flights of stairs and getting into car numbness occurred in the left neck and lower side of my face. I took advil and it has came and went for the last several days along with numbness and tingling in my left arm and hand.  Yesterday and today the numbness in my face is along my mandible and throughout sometimes I feel strange sensations in my left ear.  This morning I woke with additional numbness and tingling in my left foot and leg. As I have been awake this morning, my left leg feels heavier, tingly and my lower right leg is having some issues.  I am also having an extreme cold sensation in my feet and the thermostat reads 70 and I am dressed with socks and shoes on. My feet are white with no discoloration.

Outreached PCP and was advised that these events were side effects experienced by some after receiving vaccine.  Ibuprofin was recommended along with rest, fluids, eating small meals, monitoring of symptoms, and was advised by NP for my PCP that symptoms/side effects normally remedy  in 24 to 48 hours.  On the evening of the 48th hour, 1/8/21, after other symptoms had cleared, I began experiencing constant ringing in my left ear and some wobbliness, this continues today 1/11/21.  Called Urgent care and was advised there is nothing they can do for  such symptoms and was advised to continue to receive guidance from PCP.  Am currently awaiting call back from PCP.

                                                Anaphylactic shock; feeling some stuff in my throat; A spontaneous report was received from a 56-year-old, female nurse, who was also the patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced anaphylactic shock and feeling some stuff in my throat.   The patient&#39;s medical history included having general allergies. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.    On 28 Dec 2020, immediately prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, while the vaccination needle was being pulled out of the patient&#39;s arm, the patient experienced anaphylactic shock. Two epinephrine injections were used within ten minutes of the reaction. The patient continued to take steroids due to her still feeling some stuff in her throat at the time of reporting. Treatment for the events included two epinephrine injections and steroids.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, anaphylactic shock, was unknown. The event, feeling some stuff in my throat, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 56-year-old female patient with medical history of unspecified allergies requiring Epi-pen,  who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20A), and who experienced a serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock and a non-serious unlisted event of Oropharyngeal discomfort immediately following vaccination.  Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s history of general allergies requiring Epi-pen remain as confounders.

                                                I was fine for the 15 minute observation period - but at about 20 minutes, while driving home, I experienced a distinctive tingling in my lips and around my mouth. I also felt a bit of a tightening or light tingling in the left side of my face.  No hives, no itching, no difficulty breathing. I returned to the vaccination site for further observation, where paramedics took my vitals twice over a 20-minute period (all normal).  At that point the tingling began to subside, I declined transport to the hospital, and drove home. It&#39;s now 8 hours past the time of my injection, and I feel fine for the moment - but I&#39;m concerned that I may have experienced a mild anaphylaxis, and am wondering if I should consider not getting the follow up vaccine. I am reporting even though this is a very slight reaction, because I have read that officials are wanting to monitor side effects very closely.

When I was driving home at 1310, I developed itching to my face and head, I felt like my lower lip was numb and swollen. Like when you go to the dentist and get novocaine. I drove home and took 50 mg benadryl and called the ER. I went to the local ER and  felt hot, diaphoretic, anxious and was given 40 mg Prednisone orally. I was observed for one hour. NO SOB occurred. I was discharged home with Prednisone 20 mg daily for 8 days, epi pen and told to take Benadryl and pepcid.

My hands and feet got tingly and then while I was on the phone my tongue and throat swelled and unable  to speak and started to cough. But couldn?t clear my throat . I was able to get enough oxygen. My husband drove my to ER and which time they took my straight back took my vitals and gave me Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroid injection and it worked! They observed me few hours and sent me home.  I was unable to sleep  last night and a hallucination that concerned my husband but otherwise  I?m just achy today, note I never had a fever.

Left the clinic and noticed some eyelid swelling and took some benadryl.    The swelling didn&#39;t resolve so she presented to the ED.    She was also found to be hypertensive in the ED and required treatment for both the swelling in her eyes and the hypertension.  All symptoms resolved in about 90 min and the patient was discharged home without incident

On drive home, I began to feel a &#34;wave&#34; come over my face as though I was being Novocained.  Once home, it persisted, face, nose, lips, tongue all felt numb. I could move face, brows, lips. I did not notice swelling. The numbness lingered for about 4 hours and the numbness around lips and mouth lingered into the next day.  I assumed it may just be an allergic reaction so I kept diphenhydramine handy but never used it.

                                                First shot of Moderna vaccine.  Had the shot and waited around 35 minutes and I felt fine.  I left and was a few minutes down the street and my lips started going numb. I turned around and went back to the hospital where the shot was administered and they had me see the emergency room doctor.  My throat did not start closing, my lips just were numb.  I have had serious reactions before and they start with the lips usually so I was concerned.  My blood pressure was high as well as my pulse.  The doctor gave me prednisone and benadryl and I was feeling good after 15 minutes.  I was in the ER 45 minutes to an hour and then was released with a script to take prednisone and benadryl for the next 4 days.and to come back if I got worse.  I never got a rash or anything else, just the numb lips and increase in blood pressure.  I did have a bit of a headache as well.  I am at work now (the next day) and feeling fine.  I did speak to my doctor and she did advise me not to get the second shot in the vaccine series. .

The decreased sense of taste improved after 24 hours, but the generalized fatigue and injection site discomfort persisted over the next several days. She also experienced body aches, but notes these are fairly typical for her, so she didn&#39;t think much about it. She recalls having headaches and stomachaches around days 3-5 following her injection, and beginning on day 7, she also started to notice some injection site itching and induration.  The localized swelling and redness increased during days 7-10 following her COVID-19 vaccination, and over the last 6 hours, she also started to develop nausea. Her fatigue persists, but the headaches, stomachaches, and body aches have subsided.

I choose to take 20 mg Zyrtec and call 911 if respiratory effect declined.  Had extreme lethargy all day.  Presently, short of breath, aches and such similar to side effects mentioned.

Pretty scary.. almost called 911, could not get up from floor and did not make it to bathroom in time, felt really weak. Next day very weak, headaches, and no taste or smell, loss of appetite. Lay in bed all day weak. finally ate something and diarrhea started back, chills, fever.  Forced fluids and took Excedrin Migraine.  Felt better but later at night diarrhea and headache again. Next morning very weak for work. No taste with metal taste in mouth next two days and very weak with occassional chills and headache;  sweating in bed.  Fifth day developed some productive cough, weak, taste and smell senses returning. Now still slightly weak but getting better.

                                                12/20/20 received first vaccine of Moderna Covid series. Only experience fatigue for first couple of days. 01/03/21 - Around 2pm noticed 3 inch welt across right cheek by 5pm swelling under eyes and random itching around head, neck and face. Headed to doctor 6pm. Saw a PA who said symptoms were not from vaccine when I asked about possibility because of my Hashimotos Thyroiditis. They gave me a steroid shot and called in scrip for Medrol Pack. Later that evening I started also having bad flares of my asthma. Also continued on Benedryl. 01/05/21- started Medrol Pack and continued antihistamines. Very fatigued. 01/10/21-finished Medrol. Still slight welt on right cheek but everything else pretty good. 01/20/21- mid morning noticed welt growing in right cheek and eyes puffing up. By 5pm itching has returned. By 7pm there are now welts and hives on both cheeks and they are  red and hot....asthma flaring badly. Took 30mg prednisone from my medication used for asthma. 01/21/21- things have calmed down redness wise but lots of fatigue. Took 20mg Prednisone. 01/22/21- back to doctor, another Medrol pack. 01/27/21- finished second Medrol pack. Still having slight welts and hives.

I did pre-medicate with Benadryl and Ibuprofen. After returning home added Benadryl and then Benadryl at bedtime. I also had slight leg cramps for approximately 2 hours post injection that lasted about an hour. No further tongue swelling at bedtime, back to normal.

                                                On January 21st, noticed a rash on multiple areas of the body and by the morning of January 22nd it had spread and some had turned into welts.  Also lips starting swelling and chin hardened (onset of edema).  Went to the community med check and was given a steroid injection and due to the swelling in my face, was sent to ER for observation.  In the ER, I received Benedryl and Pepcid.  I was told that it looked like a systemic reaction from a medication.  They suggested I discontinue the minocycline since that was the newest medication that I had been on so I quit that immediately.  I was sent home with prednisone and this cleared up the rash/welts.  Of note, once the rash started, the COVID injection site starting getting red, swollen and itchy as well.

Reaction reported to Nurse.  On Sunday, January 31, 2021, 4:00 pm, my face became red and blotchy, eyelids slightly inflamed. On Monday, February 1, 2021, 6:00 p.m., eyelids were swollen, area around the eyes were red, irritated and itchy. Hydroxyzine Pamoate 25 mg taken Monday evening would normally alleviate any signs of allergic reaction.  On Tuesday, February 2, 2021, upon waking and throughout the day the area around the eyes were red, irritated, itchy and  eyelids swollen with red blotchy skin on forehead and cheeks. Possible consumption of small amounts of soy lecithin (a known allergen) present in baked goods consumed on February 1 at 12:30 pm.  Normally, I do not have an allergic reaction to small amounts of soy.

                                                I received the vaccine on 01/13/2021 and only had mild arm tenderness at the site for a couple of days with some mild to moderate fatigue and sleepiness. On the 10th day after the vaccine which would have been on 01/21/2021 my left arm which was the arm that I received the vaccine in was itching and red with hives and warm to the touch and these symptoms lasted until the evening of 01/24/2021 and then that night I developed a fever with severe stomach pain along with vomiting and diarrhea  and headache which lasted throughout the day of 01/25/2021. I was very fatigued and sleepy and then on 01/28/2021 I woke up with a blister to my forehead and then later that afternoon developed another one on my neck and then a few more later that night to the back of my neck on my c-spine. On 01/30/2021 my left ear was very sore to the back side of it and also the inside of my ear was itchy and painful as if I was developing a small pimple . This developed into itching to the inside of my ear and also redness and what looks like a rash and some eczema as this was looked at by  one of the RN&#39;s here at the clinic. I am still continuing to have fatigue and sleepiness which is not normal for me and I am still having bouts of diarrhea and stomach pain that is not my normal stomach pain. I also sent this to doctor as I wanted this to be documented in my medical record as I am due for my booster vaccine on 02/10/2021 and I am not feeling up to par to receive this at that time. Another concern is the fact that at times I do feel energetic but then all of a sudden I just feel weighed down like my arms and legs are too heavy to use. I have continued to exercise during this time but not for my full hour that I normally do every day. I am very concerned how I will react to the booster if this first one caused all of these reactions as on a normal day I only weigh 114 pounds and at my heaviest maybe 116 and I dropped down to 111 pounds this past week and I am aware that this is more than likely due to the vomiting and diarrhea and was dehydrated for a couple of days. I am going to wait for my booster until I can get more reassurance on this and am feeling more like myself .

                                                Injection site became very painful (more than just sore) at about 10pm and is still painful today (2/16/21), that it hurts to elevate my left arm. At approx. 3am on 2/16/21 - 12 hrs after shot, I was sleeping and awoke to chills, the coldest I&#39;ve been, and extremely thirsty.  I got up to put more clothes on and some sips of water and returned to bed.  The chills lasted for approx. 5 hours, and subsided.  I awoke at 11am, feeling dehydrated, weak, and like my body had been through the washing machine! It is now noon on 2/16/21 as I type this report, and I will be returning to bed for the day. I hope my immune system settles down so I can work tomorrow.

                                                On Friday, February 19, 2021- Woke up to approximately one inch rash at Moderna injection site on upper left arm.  During the day, the rash grew to approximately 3 inches in circular diameter.  It was red, itchy with bumps and hot to the touch.  The rash continued to spread down my arm over the weekend.  On Monday, Feb 22- primary doctor had never heard of Covid arm and prescribed Amoxicillin for Cellulitis.  On Tuesday, Feb 23- Went to Dermatologist who confirmed Covid arm and prescribed Triamcinolone Cream.  Wednesday morning at 3am- rash on arm improved but developed severe burning, itching, pain swelling, throughout my entire body. All the skin throughout my body was red, especially the joints.  I was developing sores in my mouth.   Felt like third degree burn all over my skin.  I returned to doctors office who advised was having a severe delayed allergic reaction to Moderna vaccine.  She also advised that I had sores in my mouth and my tongue was swollen and I could get anaphylactic and to go to the emergency room immediately if I could not breathe.  She prescribed Zyrtec and 8 days of Prednisone.

                                                The symptoms that I am experiencing that are worthy of reporting since they are not listed on the Fact Sheet are: earaches, eye pain, sore throat, bloody nose upon blowing and sore nasal cavities (such as when I&#39;d had severe sinus infections). These are still occurring, even though the general symptoms as listed below are subsiding.  Before receiving my vaccine, I was careful to drink a lot of fluid. Eight hours after receiving my second dose, intense body aches began including headache. It was a fitful night of sleep as I remember moving around in an attempt to stretch out the muscles that seemed to be tightening. The next morning as I arose I felt weak and chilled.  Highest temperature recorded was 99.0. Muscle aches, headache, joint pain (especially in my knees) persisted throughout the day. Rest and tylenol helped somewhat.

She reports she is diabetic and on insulin, and only had a small salad for lunch today. Her husband checked blood sugar and was found to be hypoglycemic in the low 50&#39;s. Patient began drinking orange juice and felt better after. She denies chest pain, SOB, difficulty breathing or swallowing, itching, swelling in throat, rash, visual disturbances, slurred speech, numbness or tingling of extremities. Patient re-checked blood sugar with her own glucometer and it was 103 prior to discharge. Symptoms completely resolved. Appropriate actions taken; no further action at this time.

I have a service dog that is sensitive to medical conditions and he came and sat very close to me for 30 minutes (unusual in my home) while this occurred.   Then it passed.

                                                A few hours after vaccination, I began to feel like I was getting ill, with fatigue and headache. I also experienced swelling at site of injection, along with hives on my face and neck on the same side as the injection. I had swelling in my neck, throat, tongue, lips, ears and eyes with some tingling. There was a red pallor on both of my cheeks. I also had slightly labored breathing. I took antihistamines and tylenol which helped reduce the symptoms within an hour. If I did not continue to take these round the clock for the next 4 days, the symptoms would get worse. Toward the end of the day, symptoms worsened regardless of antihistamine or tylenol and continue to do so as of yesterday, 1/3/2021. Symptoms have gotten better over the last 4 days. Its hard to say if I am fully recovered as in the evenings when I&#39;m more fatigued, I still have the tingling and mild swelling although the redness and hives have abated.

                                                2-3 minutes after the vaccination I developed a very fast heart rate, had a strange taste in my mouth, and for a brief second I thought my throat would close in.  I was immediately taken to the ER and monitored for about 2 hours.  During that time I had about 4 episodes of my heart rate going very high. I was told 120-150 beats/m. I was also told that I had PVC&#39;s and PAC&#39;s. I was released after 2 hours and had  another episode of a  fast heart rate on my way home. Since then I have had daily episodes of fast heart rate but not as long and not as intense.  Last episode was 2 days ago.

                                                Immediately following injection I had a metallic taste in my mouth. My heart felt like it was racing and shortness of breath. The lady who have shot said my face turned really red. Blood pressure spiked - they took it. Normally it&#39;s 107/70&#39;s-80&#39;s and it was 148/98 and my pulse was around 100 or a little more. Called Drs - to check heart. Okay. BP started going down and I sat for a little bit and I went home but I didn&#39;t drive. Went to work next day but I felt really tired. BP was in high range but not quite as high as yesterday. I was so tired and I went home for the day to rest because I couldn&#39;t work. Blood pressure started going back in normal range about 48 hours later. Metallic taste lasted about 3 days.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.

                                                Side effects started the same day I received the vaccine, which were reported on the V-safe app.  Started with very sore arm, within 24 hours progressed to extreme fatigue, joint and body aches, loss of taste and headache. I also experienced some mild nausea. By Wednesday evening, I began to experience heart palpations which I listened to as a nurse which sounded like PVC&#39;s. I have never had this happen to me before. I assessed my vital signs and noted that as the arrhythmia progressed, my O2 sat level began to decrease and my pulse began to increase. I could hear a definite pause in my heart rhythm. Within an hour, I had chest pain in the area of my left chest over my heart which progressed into a feeling of pressure as if someone was standing with a foot on my chest. As time went on, this sensation radiated into my back at an angle from left to right. It was at this point that I had my father take me to the emergency room. When I got there, my pulse was in the low 100&#39;s and my blood pressure was 230/130. I have never had this happen to me before. I ended up on a nitroglycerin drip. My magnesium level was low and my sodium level was low normal.   I was kept in the emergency room until Thursday evening then transferred to Progressive Care Unit where I remained until early evening on Friday.I was sent home on 2 different cardiac medications, Coreg and Lisinopril. I am to follow up with my PCP and a cardiologist. Both are brand new to me. I am now feeling better, but I am very reluctant to have the second covid vaccine. Also, the Hospital does not know what happened to me. (Facility where I received my Covid vaccine.)

                                                After my shot, I stayed at the facility for 15 minutes. When I started my drive home, I noticed a medicinal taste  coming from the back right side of my mouth. Approximately 10 minutes later I had a numbing/tight feeling in my right jaw. This quickly traveled to the right half of my mouth, the right side of my nose, my right cheek, my right eye (even behind the eye/a lot of pressure), above my right eyebrow, and to my right ear.   I called the health department. They said they could not give me medical advice and I should call my doctor or go to the ER. I called my doctor. In the meantime, the numbing/tightening somewhat subsided. However, it was still quite there and noticeable.   By the time I went to sleep that night, the numbing/tingling had just about all gone away. The next day I still noticed it in the corner of my right, my mouth and right cheek. By that evening it was entirely gone.   My doctor?s nurse called the next day. She said my doctor still suggested that I get the second shot. However, I?m very nervous to do so.   I wrote on a previous page that the time of my shot was 2:20. That was my appointment time. The time of my shot was 2:37 pm.

                                                Moderna dose 2 received at 1605. Patient reported funny taste and throat tightness. Oral diphenhydramine liquid 25mg was given. Tongue swelling and mild stridor were noted, prompting administration of an epinephrine pen and EMS was called. SpO2 noted to be in high 70s, along with persistent symptoms, so she was given an additional epinephrine pen as well as 100mg IM hydrocortisone. She was started on a 15L non-rebreather mask, IV was placed in the left antecubital space, and intubation kit was pulled from cart. Tongue and stridor improved after these doses of epinephrine and hydrocortisone. Blood pressure 190s systolic from 170s systolic after first epinephrine dose, with HR 116 at this point, and SpO2 99%. As EMS arrived, diphenhydramine 25mg IV was administered. At that point, tongue size and stridor were noted to have worsened again, so a third epinephrine pen was administered prior to EMS transport. Patient received racemic epinephrine inhalation nebulizer in EMS. Further treatment administered in ED: LR, dexamethasone and famotidine. Patient admitted later that day for further monitoring given hypertensive status. Put on scheduled cetirizine, famotidine, and dexamethasone and PRN albuterol and racemic epinephrine. Throughout her stay, patient continued to improve with stable vital signs and normal breathing. She was monitored for a total of 2 days and discharged home on 1/29.

The EMT brought the pt inside the building by the vaccine area where I quickly assessed her and administered 0.3mg of EpiPen AutoInjector.  The pt&#39;s lips gradually became more swollen, pt was able to talk and breath.  Pt refused 911 or other escort but agreed to go to the ED herself as she was with her husband.  Despite counseling, pt still refused 911. A public Health RN followed them to the ED and assured they were taken back quickly.  Pt was in the ED being seen within 8 minutes of the epi administration.  I called the ED to check on this pt about 60 minutes later and she was stable and planned to be discharged in a few hours.

I alerted the nurse, BP was 215/95 then repeated 190&#39;s/90&#39;s. I treated with fluid and Benadryl. The symptoms progressed to mild cough, swollen lips, and swollen inner ears. I took the second Benadryl and awaited my sister to take me home. The nurse waited with me and I assured her that I would use the Epipen and seek medical attention if the symptoms did not subside. I called my allergist on-call service who ordered steriods and encouraged EpiPen use and an ED visit. I assured her that I would seek medical care if anything worsened. I contiuned to take Benadryl and drink water. The pharmacy was closed so I could not start the steriods right away.I felt much better by morning so continued, then rebounded, took the EpiPen, and went to Ed where I was treated and released. Two days later, Increased HR requiring hospitalization, may be related to steroids

I was given Benadryl 25mg by mouth and escorted to the ER by administration.  While in the ER I was given anther Benadryl 25mg, Prednisone 40mg by mouth and epinephrine 0.3 mg injection. After about an hour I was discharged home with a prescription of prednisone 20mg to take for 10 days. I have been taking the prednisone and Benadryl 25-50 mg every 8 hours since the reaction occurred. I still have a rash on my body today and some red dots on body today also.

                                                On or about 09:40-09:45 I felt a heaviness on the left side of my tongue and a general unwellness feeling, the heaviness persisted  and then as then somewhat of a continued presence that did not go away, later followed by a metallic taste in my mouth.  As I previously had a reaction to the first H1N1 vaccine years ago, I notified the person administering the vaccine before hand and also the nurse after the vaccine who was making her rounds.  I called her over to left her know I felt a little off/different, and described what I was feeling.  She escorted me to a private area where I was further assessed and given Benadryl 25mg po x 2.  The feeling never left my tongue and reportedly there was notation of questionable welts on the left side of my tongue. .I was able to speak clearly and swallow.  I was monitored and then discharged in the company of two of my colleagues (one an ICU nurse who works with me, and the other an ICU MD/anesthesiologist) who happened to be getting their vaccinations at the same time.  The tongue feeling did not leave me until late the next day and my lips felt a little off that night of the vaccine and the next day.  I continued to take the Tylenol and allegra as well as Benadryl.  By Friday night(1/8) I was feeling better, enough to work the weekend. Tylenol helped greatly for pain at injection site.  Today (1/12) I&#39;m feeling not my best and  tired like yesterday but I had a busy weekend at work (RN in the COVID ICU), some malaise and achy (maybe my fibromyalgia or the weather), minor headache and fatigued, had a minor sore throat this am that has resolved, and Tylenol has resolved the headache.  Not sure if this needed to be included but I thought I&#39;d mention it.

                                                Neurological problems. Difficulty speaking and opening my jaw. Unable to write or say more than one word at a time. I also had some visual disturbances. These episodes  came in waves, lasting 15-30 mins at a time. They happened 3 days in a row. Each episode was followed by fatigue and diaphoresis.

Symptoms persisted for 5 hours. During that time had a few minutes about 12:30  PM of hearing blockage, followed by headache. Slight tingling still persist at time of filing (5:15 PM)  I will be contacting my doctor however since I have not been able to get a hold of them yet, I have indicated no  clinic visit at this time.

                                                Lot number might be 026L20A. My first Moderna shot was on 1-7-2021. My arm was a bit sore, red, and swollen for just a couple days and then it was fine. On 1-14-2021 I woke up with a sore upper left shoulder (the joint, not the surface injections site), left neck, throat, and jaw. It hurt a bit to eat. Later that day the injection site became hard, red, and itchy again. By 1-16-21 the injection site was no longer itchy but my shoulder, neck, throat and jaw have continued to be sore, on and off. I don&#39;t know what else could be causing this - it&#39;s not bad but it&#39;s odd. The soreness feels like lymph gland swelling. I have not consulted a doctor because it&#39;s not bad but may call clinic. I called the Moderna 800 number and filed a report that way but decided to also file this report.

                                                Nothing until Dec 30 9:30 a.m. I developed angioedema and I had a flash like red rash; hot over my whole upper body. Palms of my hands were flame red and painful. Went to ER - that day (30th)- husband took me. I took Benadryl 50 mg right away. ER gave me Decadron 8 mg PO and Racemic Epi Aerosol treatment and got lactated ringers; IV fluid. Treatments resolved issue. Dec 23 I was negative for COVID nasal swab test (as husband had been positive for it); Dec 26, I was positive for COVID nasal swab (had to test to go to work).I had no COVID symptoms. The 30th is when I developed the allergic reaction. About 31st - started having ear pain and lymph nodes swollen on opposite side of shot. January 3rd, 2021 Went to Urgent Care and I had an ear infection. January 3 had an ear infection. I never get an ear infection normally.

I tried to meditate for my 15 minutes. When I got up I felt very stressed, nauseous, foggy. I waited another 10 minutes in the hall. I felt more nauseated and went back to holding area. The nurse had me lay down. My blood pressure was around 145/100 and is usually around 100/68. My pulse was between 44-60 which is typical form me. I felt very very cold and was shivering. My hands and feet were like ice. I typically have good circulation. I rested another 30 minutes or so and went home. It took hours to warm up. The next few days were more of what I had expected: flu like symptoms, chills, tiredness, malaise, fatigue, sore arm.

                                                I received my vaccination on Friday, February 19th.  On Sunday, February 21st, my tongue felt like I had scalded it with a hot drink, and my taste buds were very sensitive.  My tongue also felt thick and there were bumps on the sides of it.  On Tuesday, February 23rd, I noticed I couldn&#39;t whistle, and I couldn&#39;t spit correctly when I brushed my teeth.  On Wednesday, February 24th, I noticed my right eyebrow was lower than my left, and my mouth was drooping on the right side.  I couldn&#39;t put my lips together to put my chapstick on,  and my smile was very crooked.  Additionally I felt my eyelid twitching and the right side of my face felt very strange in general.  So I contacted the nurse who administered the vaccine.  She said that Bell&#39;s Palsey could be symptom from the vaccine, and that I should contact my physician.  So I called Dr. office and they did a virtual appointment with me on Wednesday afternoon.  He immediately told me I have Bell&#39;s Palsey as a result of the vaccine and sent in some prescriptions for me to take.  They are Toradol Oral, Prednisone, and Erythromycin Ointment for my eye because it won&#39;t close all the way, and it doesn&#39;t blink properly.

Patient is aware of beginning symptoms of anaphylaxis since she has experienced in the past.  Patient also started feeling her eyes swell. Patient has an Epipen and was unsure if she should use or wait longer. I contacted 911 to dispatch a paramedic since we would need to contact them anyway if she decides to use her epipen. Paramedics came within 5 to 10 minutes and took her to evaluate/treat.

Early the next morning I had a horrible headache, felt feverish and nausea.  Could not take a deep breath.  The second day after the shot was the worst.  I could not get out of bed, felt like someone had their hands around my neck, but I could breath, just not deeply.  Terrible headache, not wanting food or water.  Now is the fifth day and I feel much better.  Not so sure about getting the second shot.
