After getting the shot, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and drank some water then waited 20 mins. When I left to go back to my department, I started getting dizzy and coughing. I sat down in my department and could not stop coughing so I went to the ER department. My eyes were swollen, I had a rash from my arms and legs all the way down my body. I had hives on my face and my eyes were swollen. I was coughing and wheezing. the ER RN started an IV and I was given steroids, diphenhydramine, ondansetron and IV fluids. I was also given some cough medicine. I was monitored for a few hours and before I left - they gave me hydroxyzine for the hives and itching. The PA also ordered meds for me to take at home.      - per patient report

                                                approximately 10 minutes after Covid vaccine the patient was starting to have right sided facial tingling  then she started to have tingling in her throat.  I sat with her and she had progressive tingling, worsening throat tightness and some facial swelling under her eye.  We then moved her to a room and laid her down.  I discussed the use of the Epipen and a dose was given at approximately 400PM.  We also called 911 at that time.  Vitals were taken and EMS arrived and by the time they were taking her away her symptoms were improving.

                                                I was vaccinated on 12-30 after 4 pm.  By 3:30 on 12-31 my neck quickly swelled up, my throat becoming sore, glands swollen, headache, and fatigue were my first symptoms. An unusual symptom occurred from day 2-6. My facial skin did not hurt unless I applied pressure. When I applied pressure it felt bruised and highly sensitive but didn&#39;t hurt unless pressure was applied.  I also developed a small sore along my gum line on the bottom right front of my mouth.  Both of these symptoms disappeared after day 6. 7-8 days after receiving the vaccine my neck, jaw and shoulders became extremely stiff, including a runny nose. This symptom has persisted and is the worst of all symptoms (jaw and neck stiffness and sore throat). On day 12 in addition to the ongoing sore throat,  and stiffness in my neck and jaw I developed white spots on my right tonsil.  3 days after the white spots disappeared, but the red sore throat is current. On day 20, I developed 2 more sores on the right side of my mouth. One on the bottom gum line and one on the top right gum line (this feels like a canker sore). Today I have a slight earache in my right ear.   NOTE: I tested positive to COVID June 2020. I ended up taking 1 month off work due to persistent symptoms. I still cannot properly smell and taste, and I can smell water.  Occasionally, the brain fog from COVID comes up but that is more rare.

Began profusely sweating drenching my clothes. Nausea began. Went back upstairs sat on my bathroom floor due to nausea/ dry heave. All of a sudden SEVERE abdominal pain began 10/10. Cried for my husband. Dripping sweat gave me a cold rag and foam large diarrhea began. Still 10/10 pain in abdomen. Felt like my lower abdomen was getting ripped out.  About 45 minutes or so later still 10/10 wanted to go to ER. I could not stand. If I stood my legs and body felt like I wanted to curl in a ball on the floor. He called an ambulance. I was pale as a ghost, no fever, normal vital signs. Went into full reynauds flare from body stress. Ambulance was unable to get oxygen sat and glucose at the time due to flare. Arrived at the ER labs drawn. WBC 10.9 and Glucose 194. I am not or never have been diabetic. Vaccine related. Like a lightswitch all symptoms stopped except sweating hot and cold spells, sore arm and drowsiness. Discharged at 6am

I was given 25mgs Benadryl by mouth and taken directly to ER.  In the ER I was given another 25mg Benadryl by mouth, hooked up to BP monitor, heart monitor and pulse ox.  After seeing the doctor on duty I was given an injection of a steroid and Vistaril and 2 Pepcid by mouth.  The symptoms began to subside and I was released approximately 2hrs later with prescriptions for Prednisone, Pepcid, Epi-pen and told to take 50mg Benadryl every 6 hrs for 3 days.  I was to return immediately if symptoms reoccurred.

                                                On Wednesday, Feb 17, I experienced an earache in my left ear and an eye twitch in the left eye, which continued to Thursday , Feb 18.  On Feb 18,  also experienced extreme fatigue and a jabbing, throbbing pain behind my left ear that came and went all day.  I also noticed when I brushed my teeth that I had a hard time swishing water in my mouth, especially on the left side.  On Friday morning, I woke up and noticed my left eyelid was drooping and my smile was lopsided.  As I have a history of hemiplegic migraine, I assumed I was experiencing a migraine, although this was not the usual course of these migraines, and I had not had one of these types of migraines in many years.  The left side of my head, behind my ear, and wrapping from my neck to my temple continued to hurt (but not as painful as a normal migraine).  Thinking I was in a chronic migraine state, I took 40 mg of Prednisone, as I have done before to &#39;cut through&#39; the migraine.  When the facial weakness did not resolve by the next day, I suspected this was not migraine and instead suspected Bell&#39;s Palsy and consulted my physician.  Looking back in time, I also realized that I had experienced some adverse tingling/taste sensations on part of my tongue as far back as February 8, that felt similar to burning your tongue from drinking too hot liquids that I realized later could have also been part of the Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) &amp; 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), &amp; 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable. Injection arm a little sore, no redness or swelling at site of injection. Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl. Did not have complete resolution of swelling but did improve. Mild hives, swelling of hands and feet. 1/2/21 All joint pain is gone, and injection site pain is only noticeable if someone bumps into my arm. 6a 25mg Benadryl &amp; Pepcid 10a 25mg Benadryl 2p 25mg of Benadryl 3:30pm felt fine all day with only mild swelling and redness to hands, ate chicken nachos. Face became very hot (like my face was too close to the oven when I open it), redness from eyes down, lips swollen, mild itchiness too the tongue but nothing too concerning. 4p 25mg Benadryl I strongly believe the exacerbating factor is eating as all times the symptoms increased in intensity I had just eaten. After discussion with Dr. will be cutting out chicken (chicken was eaten before all 3 instances) and all other meats until complete resolution of symptoms and will avoid any inflammatory foods such as nuts, berries and shellfish. 7p 25mg Benadryl &amp; Claritin taken 7:30p ate a banana, no reaction 8p Singular taken 9:30p put Vaseline on my lips, face &amp; ears flamed hot and swelling and redness followed. 9:45p took 25mg Benadryl 10:25p tongue thick feeling 11p took 25mg Benadryl tongue still feels thick 1/3/21 Fevers 101.6 and chills started in the night Face and lips are permanently swollen and red despite all the meds I?m taking.Lymph nodes are all swollen. I?m too afraid to eat for fear of more swelling while my face is already so swollen.

I stayed home from work and reported it and was told I could return to work on 1/11 (my next scheduled day) by workplace health. I felt fatigue and eye pressure headaches on and off since. I also felt like I was having vision changes. On 1/14/21 I noticed a small, raised, red area at the injection site. Over the weekend it continued to spread over my arm. It is warm and very mild tenderness to palpation but does not itch. I am also feeling tight muscle pain in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.

                                                Severe headache, nausea and cold sensation occurred within a few hours of receiving the vaccine.  Arm discomfort and fatigue quickly followed.  Low grade fever noted approximately 8 hours post vaccine.   I took acetaminophen.  Headache, fatigue, and fever/chills resolved within about 48 hours.  Nausea and arm discomfort persisted for about 5 days.   After approximately 48 hours, I noted vision changes, blurry up-close vision.  This change might have occurred sooner, but it was not until this time that I felt well enough to really read.  The change in vision led me to seek further evaluation in the emergency room on 1/16/2021.

This is typical for me when I am starting to fight something off.  I was managing okay until around 1pm when I started to low grade fever at 99.8.  By around 4pm, my body was really starting to ache and I was getting chills.  After the training, I took some Thera Flu, but I couldn?t really move from the couch to the bed because my body was so sore.  My fever fluctuated between high 99?s to low 100?s.  I felt like I got hit by a truck.  I managed to fall asleep around 8:00pm and was able to sleep until 1:00am.  I took more Thera Flu, water, and was able to fall back to sleep at 3:00ish am. 1/23/21:  I woke again at 11:00am and my aching was still there but not nearly as bad as the previous day but now I felt heavy congestion in my head and chest.  I also had sneezing, and a stuffy then runny nose off and on throughout the day.  I was also very, very tired and had no energy to do anything but lay there.  Today is when the diarrhea started 1/24/21:  Body aches at this point are still tolerable but I?m sore.  My arm injection site is bruising and starting to itch and still slightly warm to the touch.  I have sneezing, a dry cough, and an off and on runny nose and diarrhea  1/25/21:  Body aches are mild today, dry cough is here, post nasal drip mucus I am assuming as well.  All I want to do is sleep.  I?m so tired.  No diarrhea today so far but I haven?t had anything to eat yet.

                                                On 1/30/2021, I developed a mild headache followed by an acute change in my vision.  I went to  the emergency room 24 hours later after the symptoms had not resolved and was found to have a left superior quadrantanopia and a 2.3cm x 1.9cm hemorrhage in my right occipital lobe. I was admitted to hopsital and discharged today 2/3/2021.   My headache has resolved but I continue to have a visual field deficit.  I had been scheduled to receive the second dose of Moderna on 2/1/2021 but was unable to receive it due to my hospitalization.

                                                Within 12 hours of receiving vaccine I began to feel fatigue in my muscles and a mild headache.  The next morning I experienced brain fog, inability to formulate thoughts correctly, difficulty thinking, lack of concentration, muscle soreness, aches all over body, tired easily, shortness of breath, fever, chills,  and nausea.  36 hours after receiving vaccine, I still feel uneasy on my feet, light headedness, muscle soreness, stiff neck, nose bleeds, headache, nausea and extreme fatigue.

Then my legs started to feel heavy and numb, then my face felt numb and then my arms. I could barely pick something up and I could not stand. Then my jaw started to shake and so did my legs. I went to the ER and they said I was having a shock/panic attack response to the vaccine. On Monday 1/25 I woke up in extreme stomach pain and went back to the ER and they said I needed to have my appendix out. I went to a hospital where they tried to just give me antibiotics, but still had to have my appendix out on Wednesday 1/27.

Saturday 2/20, 24 hours after getting the vaccine my tongue started to swell up/ was splotchy/ had bumps allong the side and my throat was scratchy. My breathing/asthma was also triggered and I increased use of my albuterol.  I took benadryl with minimum results, but symptoms did not get severe enough to go to the ER.   The next day, Sunday 2/21 my tongue was still swollen and my jaw/ face were also sore and had inflammation. This was in addition to the sore arm/joints.

Episodes of low blood pressure/significant decrease in blood pressure from sitting to standing, tachycardia, and resting tremors in the hands that are intermittent in nature. Feeling of head being &#34;in the clouds&#34; constantly where something is not right.

                                                When I woke up on Dec 31 (the day after my shot), my face was swollen and my the area around my eyes was very swollen. I began taking Benedryl and continued to take Benedryl every 4-6 hours over approximately the next 48 hours. Also, I originally had no injection site reaction, however, on Jan 9th, my right arm began to itch. Upon assessment, I noted a 1.5&#34; diameter red, warm area where the vaccine had been administered. This lasted for three days, and now, January 12th it no longer itches, and looks more like a bullseye that is approximately 2.5&#34; in diameter around where the redness was. I have also noticed that since the vaccine I feel cloudy or like I have a constant mild headache.

Also on December 30th my left eye began to swell. I took benadryl that evening before going to  bed, but woke up the next morning December 31st with both eyes swollen. The left eye being worse and now under the eye was red and extremely itchy. Contacted employee health at hospital on December 30th and 31st. where vaccine was given and left a message detailing  my side effects. Contacted my own primary dr on December 31st and was seen by Dr who believes I have had an allergic reaction to Moderna vaccine. I was prescribed predinsone and zyrtec for 5 days.

                                                Felt a burning sensation in my hands right after getting the shot.  Went home,  took 2  Aleve and iced my arm for 5 minutes at a time on and off about 4 times.  Hours later,  about 8 pm I was laying down on the couch on my left side for at least 20 minutes.  When I was getting up my upper left arm was very numb and I had a strange sensation on my left side like my blood had pooled over there but it was very numb in the area.  I never have felt anything like that.  The sensation did go away over the course of a few minutes.  Soon after I was having shooting pain in my hands.  It felt like arthritis pain.  This did not last too long but came back here and there.  My lower back started hurting a little bit out of nowhere.  And then when I went to bed I started having random body aches all over.  Like brief shooting pain in different parts of my body.  I did have some dryness, weird sensation in my throat at times. The body aches kept me up until 2 or 3 am.  It was resolved by the time I woke.  I never felt that I had a temperature.  And I was not sick prior so I felt it was a cause and effect from the vaccine.  I took 2 Aleve and I went to work.  Temperature checked at work and I was 97.1,  normal.  Wore a mask all day,  social distanced at work and I had mentioned to my manager upon arrival that I had symptoms/reaction? after my shot.  I did still have some residual,  arthritis type pain in my hands during the day and more so when I got home.  I also felt fatigued when I got home from work but I was half awake most of the night before due to the body aches.  Felt pretty good,  normal on the second day after the vaccine.

                                                at 15 mins post injection started to get extremely hot from Right side to left. Then like half of my body was cut head to toe in half and the left side of my body went numb and tingly. I could barely move my extremeties. Tounge began to burn like a 9volt battery was being held on it. I was taken to the ER and was told I had a rash on my chest neck and chin. I was treated with Epi IM, Benedryl, famotdine, then had epi again because my tounge felt fat and like a 9volt battery again. Epi went IV second does and had extreme pain with that. Had IV tylenol . Along with IV fluids. For the next 5 days I have had pain in my right harm , shoulder , neck into my head to the tip of my nose. The first 4 days were so bad that I could barely move and would get nauseated and throw up if I moved just right. each day the pains in my right arm,shoulder, neck and head did get better by about 25 percent each day. You could feel it getting better with each day I woke up.  I was also having ear pain that seemed to be worse on 1/19/21. A PA checked my ears and said they were clear.Today, 1/22/21 is the first day I have been able to turn my head without being so sore and feeling nauseated. I was also very fatigued until today, 1/22/21. My hips and lower body are sore today and upper body seems to be less sore by 75%. I still am numb at times in my feet and fingers but can turn my head a lot better today.

On 1/21/2021 I went to visit the optometrist and was immediatley referred to the  opthamologist for a same day appointment. I was told it looked like a herpetic keratis (HSV 1 virus) by both physicians. I have a left corneal transplant. I have never had an HSV virus affect my eye in the past. The last fever blister I had was &gt; 5 years ago.  Treated with maxitrol qid, Acyclovir five times a day, Cyclogel bid. Severe light sensitivity resolved after about 24 hours.  On f/u appointment on 1/26/2021 he said that the herpatic lesion was looking better. Eye pain resolved. I am continuing medication.

                                                She received her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 7:30 AM on 1-22-21. At 9:15 AM, she felt lightheaded, her heart was racing, and vertigo.  She had a nurse check her blood pressure and it was 101/65 and her heart rate was 138 bpm.  She felt presyncopal so she went to the ED for evaluation.  By the time she got to the ED, she felt her throat was scratchy, and when she would lie down flat she felt her throat was occluding.  She notes that she is s/p tonsillectomy in 12-2020, and considered whether that was playing a role in her symptoms, but she had not had any of those throat symptoms for 1 week prior to getting her COVID-19 vaccine.  In the ED, she was given IV medications and IV fluids.  ENT was consulted.  Her symptoms got better with medications, she is still experiencing some throat dryness but otherwise is feeling back to her usual self.  She never had any rash, flushing, itching.  She had a little tenderness at the injection site only.  She never had any difficulty breathing, lip/eye/tongue swelling, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, vomiting/diarrhea/abdominal pain.  She did have nausea when she felt vertigo.

I wear an Apple Watch and notice my heart rate was steadily climbing. I asked the exit secretaries to be seen by a nurse and as they were getting a nurse my heart rate reached 169 and I was feeling faint and beginning to shake. When the nurse came she noticed how white my hands were and my breathing was becoming labored. The nurse called a code white and an ICU nurse and respiratory specialist arrived to assess me. I thought I would pass out and they had me lay on my back with legs up. They tested my blood sugar and were assessing my vitals. My breathing was fast but I was still able to breathe. My heart rate started to slow down but remained somewhat high. they helped me into a wheelchair and escorted me to the emergency department. I was assessed for cardiac concerns and labs were taken. After a couple of hours in the ED the dizziness started to subside but I had excessive thirst and dry mouth and slightly swollen tongue. I had feeling of butterflies in my stomach off an on. My heart rate stabilized and I was cleared to go home after four hours.

                                                Within 5 minutes after shot my lips were feeling tingly. at 15 minutes out a co-worker sat by me and I told her about my lips and she commented that I had a large red mark/rash on my neck. I went to the nurse and she asked if I was nervous - which I was. She told me that I should take a Benadryl. I took a single Benadryl.  I went home and was still feeling the tingling sensation and had the rash which had spread onto my chest.  I took another Benadryl about one hour after the initial shot. This reduced the rash and tingling sensation. as it wore off about 4.5 hours later the rash, tingling lips and facial swelling started to appear. I took two more Benadryl and called the on call doctor at my physicians office.  He advised me to continue taking Benadryl until 48 hours after the vaccine, I did this every 4-5 hours including waking during the night to keep up on it. I was also taking Advil at this point to try to help with the swelling and a dull headache that had set in. I should note that I have never had any facial injections or anything like unto it. For 40 hours post vaccine I did this. After 48  hours the symptoms seemed to go away. I did start feeling a metallic taste in my mouth that night and the following night so I took a single Benadryl at bedtime those nights and that seemed to resolve it. I have had a slight cough and congestion on days 3-6 when I woke up in the morning, but that would resolve itself within an hour of being up. The doctor on call that I spoke with the first night did advise me to still get the second dose, but to take some Benadryl ahead of time and to make sure that the clinic has a current EpiPen on site.

Fatigue onset at that time as well.   Treated with Benadryl, neti pot, Flonase, warm compress and rest.  Symptoms alleviated after 2 days.   Injection site is still slightly red and irritated 8 days after vaccine.

But worst is inability to lift left arm, severe left arm pain, even joint pain in left wrist. Could barely lift L arm on day 2 after (Sunday) and again unable to lift it day 3 after (Monday).  First dose, I had arm pain, trouble lifting it 1 day, pain for a week and mild soreness for the whole month. Pre-existing joint pains from autoimmune were worse for a week, but this second dose - it only seems to be vaccine side, including left jaw, left eye pain, left collarbone pain near a previously affected injury.

When I woke up the next morning, the site was raised and swollen more than the night before. It had the appearance of cellulitis. It was still hot to the touch. I marked the edges of the rash and it progressively got bigger over the course of 48 hours. I still have a mark on my arm where the rash was. I also had severe jaw and neck pain. I felt like my wisdom teeth were pulled with no lidocaine.  I has boughts of nausea and was very tired. I tried to put ice on the area of my arm that was swollen, but it did not help.

Day 2: residual headache (50%), tiredness, weakness, sweating if doing things, residual knee joint pain, sense of smell/taste returned and heightened. Day 3: residual headache (25%), still not 100%, residual knee joint pain. Day 4 (today):  residual knee joint pain (comes and goes). I realize that these are not symptoms of an allergic reaction, but severe side effects.

Upon waking the next day(1/5/21) , I felt like I had a migraine on the left side of my face.  Head, ear, and jaw on the left side was painful.  Used  Aleve . The pain was still present, although a little less intense the following day (1/6/21). Arm is also sore but much more manageable than the head pain.

                                                approximately 15 minutes after the vaccine was administered I developed numbness in my tongue, metallic taste in mouth, and headache and a fullness feeling in ears.  1 and 1/2 hours later I developed neck pain and numbness in the left side of my face that lasted for 48 hours.

Pt. evaluated by their in house medical team who administered a Benadryl injection to the right arm, unknown dosage. The pt. told me the nurse on staff measured her SPO2 at 86% and wanted to call 911 for transport to the ER. Pt. reports she refused and left work to come to the urgent care clinic where I evaluated her. She is concerned that she could be having a panic attack vs. allergic reaction. Her itching arm and metallic taste has resolved but she feels chest pains on the left side of her chest and her left arm feels heavy.

Between 1-2 hours after injection, I noticed a little bit of a scratchy throat,  increased thirst, and mild headache. No treatment required.  I took Benadryl and Tylenol when I returned home from my shift at work about 4 hours after the injection. The next day, 1/3/21, scratchy throat had disappeared.  I felt tired, slight fever of 99.5, increased thirst, and very sore arm.   On 1/4/21, I just have slightly sore arm and a little tired with no fever.  I took Tylenol.

After 2-3 minutes the headache diminished but did not go away fully.  Patient took Tylenol 500mg to combat the headache.  Headache has lasted throughout the next few days and has finally gone away on day 7 post injection.  The headache was unusual in that when the patient moved their eyes or read or moved facial muscles the pain became stronger.  The patient&#39;s eyes were sore and tender for the duration of the timeframe mentioned. Also, the injection site was completely pain-free on the day of the injection.  However, the following 5 days after injection, the site became very sore and tender with no redness or swelling present.  Patient did contract the COVID virus and tested positive on day 4 post-injection

                                                One week post-vaccine injection, sharp pains began on and off on the left side of my face. These moved from cheek to jaw to lip to left eye and at the nasal base. There was also stabbing pain in the left eye.  I thought this was due to just being tired from long days at work, but I was also aware it might have been related to the vaccine. Therefore, I took 1600 mg of acyclovir I had on hand to prevent occasional cold sores and went to sleep. The following day, unfortunately, these sharp pains persisted on and off throughout the day. I retook acyclovir and went to work. I reported this to my PCP, and she thought it was unrelated to the vaccine. I spoke with surgeons in my office, and after examination, they both clearly said it was a reaction in my 5th cranial nerve. They both recommended prednisone or methylprednisolone, but my PCP didn&#39;t agree, and therefore, I did not receive a prescription for prednisone. I retook acyclovir, and by the following afternoon of  Friday, January 15, I was no longer experiencing sharp pains on the left side of my face.

                                                Fatigue hit within a couple of hours; So tired and this was fall in to bed and be out. I slept for awhile - I rested all day the second day. I was getting dizzy and; muscle pain; a lot of joint pain (normally I&#39;m not in a lot of pain and never this tired). I needed a cane to walk I went to work on Wednesday and I had to leave early (11:30). Wed - horrible diarrhea Started getting a little confused and  still had dizziness and joint pain was bad. Couldn&#39;t take care of patients. Went to work on Thursday and I had to leave earlier yet that day - by 9:00 am - Started having chills  but didn&#39;t have fever and still had other symptoms and was getting confused.   Had an excruciating headaches and nausea (no diarrhea but extreme nausea) and that day started light and sound sensitivity - so bad. Was getting scared driving home - and had very slurred speech. Couldn&#39;t drive for a week after that(. My sister was on the phone with me helping me stay alert and drive safely on the way home from work on that Thursday.) Thursday when I got home. - had Telemed visit - Set up appt for a rapid COVID test - and a flu test so my sister drove me and I slept the whole way there. My sister said my speech was slurred; confused in my speech and I felt like that for three days. Both (Covid and flu) tests came back negative. Times when my sister couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying and I slept more than I was awake (Thursday - Saturday was like this). Took Imodium for diarrhea when I had that. For joint pain - I treated it by tramodal 50 mg and I can take it as needed and I usually don&#39;t need it but took it consistently during this time.  What scared me the most was I could feel my Hip Implant  - ball and socket joint from bone all the way to my femur( I had Right implant on Hip on May 2019) - which is healed completely but I felt it at this time. I still can&#39;t lay on my right side without pain - like a deep bone pain.  I was going to call my surgeon today.  January 4th visit with my Dr - for check-in - He gave me a clearance to go back to work on Wed the 6th. I work two days a week; I&#39;m on disability and so have been able to work since then. Right hip pain is still  a lot and bouts of dizziness and still have joint pain. Have to take a minute and a couple of breaths to stand up. Some days I do have to use may cane. Chills are gone.

                                                Within 8 hours of shot administration, I was running fever and experiencing chills.  Ran fever (as high as 102.7) for the next 48 hours.  Lethargic, no appetite, muscle and joint aches, severe headache.  The symptoms experienced in the 48 hours after vaccine were vastly more sever than the symptoms I had when I had COVID.  Fever broke during the night on 1.21.21.  Felt much better on 1.22.21, but was still very tired and had headaches.  On 1.25.21, I awoke with a SEVERE headache on the left side of my forehead and temple.  My eye was bothering me.  When I looked in the mirror, my left eyelid was swollen and red.  The left corner of my mouth was drooping.  My doctor diagnosed me with Bell&#39;s Palsy on 1.25.21.  Symptoms are worse today.  She prescribed a steroid dose pack to help with the inflammation of the facial nerve.  Steroids were started today, 1.26.21.

                                                I got the vacine today.  Unfortunately I did have a reaction, and had to cancel my patient load at work for the day.  They said if you have food allergies you might have one, but I was willing to risk it.  They observed me for 30 min after.  After 15 min it felt like I was having a mild panick attack, but I?m used to that so I just breathed through it.  Coughed a few times.  After 30 min got up and was whoozy/dizzy, but shrugged it off, got my card and walked slowly to my car, drove 5 min home.  By then my hands were shaking hard.  It was like being shot with a crapload of adrenaline.  I called my sister and when I talked I started sobbing.  I don?t know, I just couldn?t stop.  But I knew it was just the adrenaline and if I could calm down, I?d get thru it.  She was awesome bc she kept her voice soft and low when she spoke, which helps.  After 3 hours it has calmed down and I?m just really cold and exhausted and nauseous and only a little shaky.  Being quiet and calm is helping.  Also sitting on a heating pad bc it?s 74 in my apartment and I?m freezing cold.  I?ll be ok by end of day.  I got the Moderna vacine and I?m still glad I did and thankful I could get it....but to those who are getting it...symptoms are that it feels like being shot full of adrenaline, you get a panic attack, but my O2 actually went up, not down.  Chest pain, panting, high anxiety, shaking, nausea, dizziness.

Can smell coffee, candles etc. if nose is held close. Cannot taste coffee, oranges, toothpaste, salt, mustard, etc.  Had no symptoms 1/30, 1/31, or 1/1. Starting 1/2, had a migraine (including nausea) that persisted until 1/8. As patient (me) has cluster migraines, its difficult to say if this was related to vaccine, but feel it should be noted this was an especially intense migraine week (also was with menstruation so likely &#34;normal&#34;)  Other than that, feel generally tired.

The patient&#39;s medical history included migraines and a hysterectomy. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included sumatriptan, naratriptan hydrochloride, and galconezumab.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A) in the left deltoid intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   A pharmacist called stating she received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 02 Jan 2021 at 9:45am in her left deltoid. Immediately after receiving the vaccine, she had facial flushing, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion and choking in the throat that lasted 20 minutes. After a few hours, she stated confusion would come and go, and she had no emotions. The next morning, the confusion was gone. On 03 Jan 2021, she reported having body aches and a fever of 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. She reported chills, body aches, and a lot of pain in the left arm. If she tried to move her left arm, the entire muscle in the left arm hurt.  Treatment for the events included acetaminophen and an antihistamine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was withdrawn.   The events, choking, flushing, vision blurred, were considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events, confusional state, emotional disorder, and dizziness, were considered resolved on 03 Jan 2021. The events, body aches, pyrexia, chills, and limb discomfort, were not considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 48 year old female patient with medical history of migraines, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Choking, non-serious unexpected events of Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, Confusional state, Emotional disorder, Pain, and Limb discomfort, and non-serious expected events of Pyrexia and Chills. The events of Choking, Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, and Confusional state occurred immediately after administration of their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A). The event of Emotional disorder occurred on the same day when the patient received mRNA-1273. The events of Pain, Pyrexia, Chills, and Limb discomfort occurred on the next day of mRNA-1273 administration. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                The day of the injection, approx. 3-4 minutes after getting the injection, I almost passed out.  I became hot, sweaty, dizzy and my head starting to buzz.  The nurse on-site provided me a couple cold packs and after about 30 minutes, I felt better. The nurse described my response as a &#34;vascular&#34; reaction.  Later that night, I got a headache and night sweats and bouts of nausea.  They only lasted a day.    Approx. 10 days after the injection,  the injection site became red, swollen, itchy and uncomfortable to the touch. Then it traveled down my arm and created a large red, swollen, itchy area on my entire upper arm.   I advised my doctor and she provided me a Rx for a topical steroid and oral steroid.    After 5 days of treatment, it is 90% better.   The injection site still hurts.

                                                At 2 a.m. on January 10th, I woke up with a high pitched ringing  sound in my head. The sound was constant and disrupts my sleep significantly. It is always present but not as noticeable during the day when there is noise in the surrounding area, however, my job requires a lot of report writing and for that I work in silence. Therefore, the ringing sound is very distracting and makes it hard to focus. I saw my general practitioner, on January 14th at 4:15 p.m.. She cleaned out my right ear and started me on a 6-day steroid. She did not clean out the left ear because it did not appear to have any wax buildup. I began taking the steroid on Saturday January 16th. The ringing is still there but it does seem to be more on my left side than my right now. I went to an ent specialist on January 19th who checked my hearing and said there was no hearing loss. Her recommendations were to call her in a week and if ringing doesn&#39;t go away, she will try another steroid. As of today, the ringing is still present and I have finished the course of steroid.

The night of the injection my arm hurt, a bruise was present and a large lump (1 inch by 2 inches) was present. Blood was also in the band aid ( 1 drop) applied to the injection site. The night of, I had shortness of breath, and severe right eye socket pain. I also had tenderness on the right and left side of the tongue. The injection site swelling and tongue pains were significantly reduced by 01/24/201.  On 1/26/2021 I visited my eye doctor who took pictures of my eyes to confirm no internal injury since pain around the sockets was still present . I have been prescribed eye drops. If the pain does not go way as of 1/28/2021 I will revisit my eye doctor.

I have never experienced this constant and prolonged tinnitus before and it has continued since it first started around January 20th.  I thought it would go away, but it never did.  It appears I may have some hearing loss at this time now as well, which I did not previously have.

I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

                                                I started to have mild symptoms (malaise, flush feeling and then numb, tingling, weak hands followed by joint pain) in the afternoon of 1/7. The symptoms progressively worsened into what my husband (an immunologist) called an intense hyperimmune response. I had severe COVID symptoms (intensified from my experience having the virus in Sept): fever 100-102, flushed face, intense muscular and some neurologic symptoms--joint arthralgia and myalgia, headache, shivers/rigors, extreme weakness (especially my hands) and later I could barely stand or walk, glandular pain with minor swelling (axillary and neck), nausea, and my hearing was temporarily diminished--nearly lost for a few minutes; tylenol 500 mg taken the night of 1/7. The intense symptoms have subsided. Currently I am tired, weak, achy, and afebrile (last ibuprofen 200 mg taken last night). My hands remain weak.

                                                about 10 min after the injection as I was sitting in the waiting area I got a hot feeling come over me and I felt the color drain from my face and I felt like I was going to &#34;pass out&#34; it passed after about 15 seconds and I felt fine. I waited 30 min from vaccine time to make sure I was going to be ok. At 5:30 pm on 1/6/21 I noticed I stared itching my right arm around the inside of the elbow. I noticed my vision blurring and I had a sudden onset of a Horrific headache. By 6 pm I was itching very severely. It was as if I was clawing at my skin. I called one of the dr&#39;s I  work with and he called me in a medrol dose pack. I started the dose pack at 8:30 pm on the 6th. The headache continued, I tried motrin, fiorcet, and oxycodone with no relief. I still have the headache but it is not as intense as it was. I was up all night itching and dealing with the headache by the am , my jaw was  visibly swollen and it felt like I had been in a fight. I was not able to go to work on 1/7/21 and could only work 1/2 day on 1/8/21. the itching did not subside much till sat 1/9 but is coming back as I  taper down off the steroids. My last pill was this am. The jaw pain and swelling lasted till sat night and is subsiding daily. I may have to call my pcp and be seen this week.

                                                On 01/07/21, I woke up around 4 a.m. with a fever, headache, and severe body aches. I felt the same as I felt when I had COVID-19 on 11/01/20. I remained achy all day with a fever up to 103.4.  I was fever free by the morning of 01/08/21 and returned to work but still not feeling well, still a little achy.  On 01/10/21, I woke at around 5 a.m. with hives, a rash, and severe itching. The rash and hives were migrating from one part of my body to another. It started on my torso and buttocks and then migrated to my arms and legs.  I took Benadryl with some relief. My feet were itching most of the night even after taking more Benadryl. On 01/11/21, I went to work and continued to have itching with a rash and hives on my legs and arms and then on my neck and face.  My eyelids and lips began to swell. I was seen by provider and given Benadryl IM as well as a steroid IM (I think Depo-Medrol).  They also gave me a Rx for famotidine and loratadine.  I continued to have some itching all over and severe itching and swelling of my fingers that evening. I took Benadryl later that evening and loratadine and famotidine at bedtime I felt much better by the next morning with only slight swelling of my eyelids and slight itchiness. It took a couple of days for my eyelids to return to normal with no swelling.

The next day I had fever, chills, nausea and it just continued. Yesterday morning I had my husband take me to ER and I had lost 15 pounds since Wednesday. I couldn&#39;t keep down fluids. They tested me for Corona and the flu but both were negative. They also gave me fluids. Everything and smells and tastes terrible. They gave me Zofran but it didn&#39;t help. I haven&#39;t been able to take my medicine.

I stayed 1 hour after at facility . The next day disorientation was better. The head pressure was better after 2 weeks. The hearing loss has slightly improved. The ear ringing worsened significantly and is still going on now, 9 weeks later. It has improved some now after seeing an ENT ear specialist. I have been taking medicine to try to help the ear ringing for about 7 weeks. The severity of the ear ringing has gone from an 8 out of 10 in loudness to about a 2. It is not gone and may never go away.

                                                I received the shot at 8:10 am and felt nothing.  As the morning progressed, I developed a sore arm, similar to a flut shot.  However, it was worse, and I also felt achy in my neck.  I drove home from work around noon, and I couldn&#39;t even use my arm on the steering wheel.  These symptoms continued and I finally took Tylenol in the middle of the afternoon, and evening going to bed.  I slept horribly and woke up feeling like a train wreck.  I took my temperature. It was 102!  I started taking the Tylenol again.  I couldn&#39;t even raise my arm, either. My arm didn&#39;t hurt if it was just still, but it would hurt if it was touched, and I could not raise it for 3 days.  Despite taking the Tylenol, I felt awful all day and really had to stay bedridden.  I was also very thirsty both the day of the vaccine and this second day.  Saturday morning I woke up feeling better, but as the day wore on, the aches and fever came back.  Sunday was the same as Saturday.  Monday was similar, but better overall.  Today is Tuesday.   My arm still feels a little weird and I cannot completely raise it. I did have the COVID-19 back in March and have antibodies, as far as I know as I have donated to Red Cross 4 times.

                                                Following day (Wed) my right eye was irritated and became itchy later on.  Had Dr look at it and she started me on hot compresses with orders to start eye drops with antihistamine if this did not help.  Did hot compresses felt a bit better on Thurs.  Fri eyes were worse, started Eye drops.  Saturday ears were itchy and sore with drainage--thought infected.  Sunday both eyes were red, itchy oozing,, ears still oozing and sore--went to Urgent care.  They said no ear infection and started me on Eye drops with steroids but could not get them until Monday around 5pm.  Corners of mouth started cracking open as well.  Monday started steroid drops. Wednesday eyes were much worse and felt like glass in them.  called Dr.  She said to stop steroid drops and go back to antihistamine drops and start Claritin.  Started immediately and I started putting Ivarest in my ears. Eyes have stopped oozing but are still red.  Ears are clearing up and not as sore.  Mouth is starting to clear up

Could not hear out of right ear on Jan. 9 at 5:00 pm.  By 7:00 pm I had excruciating pain in right ear and went to the ER.  I was on Amoxicillin from Jan. 9-Jan. 22.  I still had little to no hearing in right ear.  On Jan. 22, the ENT diagnosed me with a moderate/severe conductive and sensorineural hearing loss with nerve damage.  I had a ventilation tube placed in right ear on Jan.22 and placed on steroids to try to recover some hearing loss.  I will follow up with the ENT in two weeks. Not sure yet if this is permanent damage.

                                                It started with a fever of 99.8 (norm is 97.4). I had brain fog. really slow thoughts. I felt like my brain was in slow motion. Big time fatigue. I felt like I was carrying a truck. I also noticed with my MS I am wobbly but I can catch myself but I felt like it was getting much worse. I called my Dr. and she thinks that the vaccine caused a flare-up in my MS. She gave me a prednisone pack. the last dose of prednisone I took, I was still fatigued. I began using a walker because I couldn&#39;t walk safely. I noticed as I tried to get out of my car a few days later I was thrown backwards which caused me to land on my glasses which cut my face and resulted in stitches. I did test but my MS was not in an active flare but they said it could be in a flare because of the COVID vaccine. they couldn&#39;t give me medication because that medication causes heart spasms. I was denied by my insurance to go to rehab. I cant walk and I am currently in the hospital.

I was seen my Dr.  I was given 10 mg of steriod and Benadryl.  I was evaluated for 3 hours and discharged with Diphenydramine 25 mg script. The swelling decreased 2 days later.

Worst part was, I had like a tingling and burning sensation that radiated to my extremities legs and feet. Sweating in feet that came in waves. I felt like my skin was on fire, like I was too close to a heater. Waves of numbness and tingling that was constant that lasted for approximated 5 days. Bad taste in mouth like a metallic taste. Blood pressure was extremely high. Worse at night. I went to ER on 1/3/21, because I was still having waves of burning and discomfort that was raising my blood pressure. I thought after 72 hours I would be better and it did not so this is why I went to ER.  Day 5, I had lost of taste, runny nose, light nausea. By day 6, the cough turned into itchy throat discomfort. Day 7 low grade fever. Day 8, everything started to subside.

Rash went away.  SOB lasted off and on for several days. Heart rate was off when I was working out for a couple of weeks.  I work out  so we wear heart rate monitors.  Heart rate did not recover as quickly as normal during my workouts. Took a couple of weeks for this to get back to normal for me.  Just really felt &#34;off&#34; for awhile and not like myself.  Did not feel comfortable getting second shot because of the above symptoms.

Patient was having no problems breathing, no wheezing, no problem swallowing so we did not administer epinephrine.  We called 911 in case symptoms escalated at 12:55pm.  EMS was present in 5 minutes.  EMS monitored patient but left store at 1:23 because patient did not want to go to emergency room and her symptoms were not worsening.  Patient stated that her husband was home, very close by, and that he was a nurse practitioner and that he was going to monitor her at home.  Patient purchased Benadryl liquid and Claritin tablets.

All mild and expected as possible side effects.  No concerns.  Symptoms continued and by 1/5; all symptoms had move to severe level and are still occurring today 1/8.  Temperature spikes to 102.8; chills, severe headache especially in eye sockets, body aches, and heaviness in chest.  Could not work on 1/7 and only for a bit on 1/8 (working from home).  Became concerned and was flu and covid tested on 1/7;  both negative.  I was retested for Covid on 1/8 and still negative.  I am not sure if maybe I am sick with something else and this is coincidence or if I am just experiencing issues from the vaccine that are a little different from others?

Usual &amp; expected solicited SEs: fatigue, soreness, feeling &#34;off,&#34; transient headache, chills sx Day 2- strong R arm pain, cannot lift R arm.  Metallic taste in mouth and tingling tongue persists.  Also same usual Sx as day 1 plus mild nausea.   Felt really crummy.   Day 3- Still moderately strong R arm pain, can only partially lift arm over head, cannot straighten over head.   Strong fatigue continues, mild nausea.   By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

                                                The patient received her COVID19 vaccination, the Moderna mRNA vaccine, on Friday, January 8, 2020 at 10 AM.  She developed some low-grade fevers and fatigue over the next 24 hours, treated with ibuprofen.  However, by Saturday evening, as her fever was slowly improving, she developed some puffiness of her eyes.  The swelling progressed further on Sunday accompanied by low-grade fever and by Monday affecting both eyelids, upper as well as lower, with a burning sensation and some pruritus.  She has noted some desquamation of her skin in that area.  She comes into the office today because of persistent swelling.  She denies any respiratory or throat complaints.  She also states that she has a dry spot on the right side of her mouth, started on Sunday afternoon.  She has not used any fillers and has not had any cosmetic procedures done on her face.   She did develop chondrodermatitis to retinol-A in 2018.  She states that she does have sensitive skin and has used hypoallergenic items intermittently.  She prefers not to place cosmetics on her skin.  She is currently using Victoria&#39;s secret Eau so sexy lotion once every other week, typically on her cheeks.  She did use this cosmetic on Sunday on her cheeks, after she developped the swelling of her eyelids.   She does not receive further vaccinations due to personal preferences.  She did receive a Kenalog injection 2018 in her first MTP.  That ingestion contained polysorbitol 80.  She did not have an adverse reaction to the injection.   She was sick with Covid November 2020, diagnosed via positive PCR swab at the urgent care as per patient.

                                                within 30 seconds I had a cooling sensation rush across the tip of my tongue, then a sweet taste, then more identifiable as bubble gum flavored.  By 12:45 I noticed I was scratching several areas of my body. Arms, legs, chest, neck, back and scalp and kept clearing my throat.  I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

I had a virtual visit on the 28th and got tested and got the results on the 12/29 and was positive for COVID-19.  I went to the ER on 1/3 because I just wasnt feeling well and was advised my bone marrow were throwing off immature white blood cells. And after about 8 or 9 days is when I finally began to get some relief an symptoms began to resolve.

                                                On day 1 I had a bad taste in my mouth with nausea and flushing, the later I had moderate fatigue and muscle aches.  That night I had severe left arm soreness to the point where I needed a narcotic, I had some at home. The pain woke me up. The next day I was more tired and had a stomach ache and more fatigue, left arm sore took Tylenol, fluids and did not call my doctor. Went to bed with a narcotic. Sunday into Monday 1/9 -1/10 I had severe diarrhea and could not eat, sore throat, muscle aches, decreased left arm soreness.  Full relief by Thursday.

On the next day, noticed about a 3 inch wide (across) and 1 inch long (head to toe) redness with a hard lump in my left arm/where the injection site was. Redness and hardness took about 3-4 days to resolve and my arm had a deep itch to it as the redness resolved. On 01/06/21 arm redness returned with the itching  with some itching of my face and head but resolved in a couple of days.

The taste was there just long enough for me to notice the metallic taste and then it was gone.  I had no other adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I did have the muscle aches and fatigue that been documented as common side effects post-vaccination but those eased after about 36 hours. I searched online for &#34;metallic taste&#34; but was unable to find any information as to whether this is an expected side effect, hence my reporting it now.

Itching around the mouth the next day(Saturday).  Red spots on chin started appearing on (Sunday) the third day. Red painful spots continued to come up on scalp, eyelid, eyebrow, and forehead all on the left side of my head.  Finally went to a Clinic (Saturday 2/20/21)and was diagnosed with Shingles.  Prescribed Valacyclovir Hcl 1 gram tablet.  Was told to contact eye doctor since most of the red areas were around left eye.  Also scheduled with family doctor to get something prescribed for nerve pain.

Experienced head ache with sharp pains in various locations inside my head the day before. As of 1:10pm on the same day, the redness is still there and is warm to touch. No swelling appears to be at the site.   I did not have any side effects of the shot at any other time other than tasting a sweet taste in the back of my throat 2 minutes  after being given the shot. It went away by the time I was released from vaccine location.

The nurse could see me turning red and feel the heat on my body. My BP and HR were also high. After those symptoms started leaving I became extremely cold. My hands stayed so cold they could not get a reading on my oxygen level. I did not feel short of breath at any time. I had a total of 4 episodes like this with each one being smaller and leaving sooner. They gave me juice and a graniola bar, kept checking my temp and blood pressure. After an hour to hour and half I was released to my son and husband. I took a benedryl whenI left.

When I felt it it had swelled. To say it itched is an understatement. Day 8: Right arm lymph node mildly swollen, no pain. Injection site red in area slightly larger then the area of my palm. Slightly warm and SUPER itchy. Day 9: Injection site still red, although slightly less so, slightly warm , and barely itchy.

                                                I got my vaccine at 3pm, I felt fine the entire afternoon, somewhere around 6 r 7 pm my arm hurt it was sore. It was not red, it was not swollen, it was just sore. I decided to take a bath, and went to bed. Felt tired and my arm was sore but it was mild, around 8 or 9 o&#39;clock.  I went to bed at 8 or 9 o&#39;clock and woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning and arm was very sore, would call it moderate. I took 500 Tylenol and 200 ibuprofen together.  Throughout the night my head hurt and i tried to go back to sleep. at 5 in the morning my head was excruciating, I would it an 8. My arm was very sore, I would give it an 8. My body hurt really bad so i give that an 8. so I&#39;m thinking ok this is what you get when you get a vaccine so I went back to bed. from 5-8 am  tossed and turned. at 8 o&#39;clock i got up and was very wobbly and weak and had chills. I checked my temp and it was 101.5. I went down stairs but had to take one stairs at a time because I was so weak, I went to kitchen because I was so thirsty. I tried to fix some ice water and lemon but it spilled. Went back upstairs because I had so many chills. I called my job at the Clinic but all they had was a voicemail. My face hurts my jaw hurts and my neck on the side where they gave me the shot, my right side. I was trying to put something in my stomach but I could only eat a few sunflower seeds. My body head and arm hurts so bad, moving is excruciating. I felt great all week and yesterday.

Took 25 mg benadryl and Proair inhaler. Feeling of throat tightness started to relieve within 20 minutes. No further problem with the throat tightness after that. Asthma flared slightly after injection but controlled with routine asthma meds.

Outreached PCP and was advised that these events were side effects experienced by some after receiving vaccine.  Ibuprofin was recommended along with rest, fluids, eating small meals, monitoring of symptoms, and was advised by NP for my PCP that symptoms/side effects normally remedy  in 24 to 48 hours.  On the evening of the 48th hour, 1/8/21, after other symptoms had cleared, I began experiencing constant ringing in my left ear and some wobbliness, this continues today 1/11/21.  Called Urgent care and was advised there is nothing they can do for  such symptoms and was advised to continue to receive guidance from PCP.  Am currently awaiting call back from PCP.

                                                Anaphylactic shock; feeling some stuff in my throat; A spontaneous report was received from a 56-year-old, female nurse, who was also the patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced anaphylactic shock and feeling some stuff in my throat.   The patient&#39;s medical history included having general allergies. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.    On 28 Dec 2020, immediately prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, while the vaccination needle was being pulled out of the patient&#39;s arm, the patient experienced anaphylactic shock. Two epinephrine injections were used within ten minutes of the reaction. The patient continued to take steroids due to her still feeling some stuff in her throat at the time of reporting. Treatment for the events included two epinephrine injections and steroids.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, anaphylactic shock, was unknown. The event, feeling some stuff in my throat, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 56-year-old female patient with medical history of unspecified allergies requiring Epi-pen,  who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20A), and who experienced a serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock and a non-serious unlisted event of Oropharyngeal discomfort immediately following vaccination.  Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s history of general allergies requiring Epi-pen remain as confounders.

The patient stated she felt faint and her lip was starting to &#34;feel swollen&#34; and tingling. Initial vital signs were: blood pressure  147/79, heart rate  69, respirations  20 and oxygen saturation  99 percent. A nurse practitioner and doctor evaluated the patient and noted patient had oropharyngeal edema and lungs were clear to auscultation (CTA).   At 0851, diphenhydramine 25 milligrams orally was given with no effect. Facial redness and edema worsened.  At 0855, epinephrine 3 milligrams was given with improvement, but after 5 minutes, facial redness and lower lip worsened.   At 0902, a second dose of epinephrine was given.  At 0903, vital signs were: blood pressure  162/87, heart rate  104, respirations  20 and oxygen saturation  100 percent on 4 liters of oxygen. Facial redness and edema improved but still had swelling and tingling of lower lip.  At 0909, emergency medical services (EMS) were called and patient was transported to emergency room/department.   Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine, epinephrine and oxygen.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.

The decreased sense of taste improved after 24 hours, but the generalized fatigue and injection site discomfort persisted over the next several days. She also experienced body aches, but notes these are fairly typical for her, so she didn&#39;t think much about it. She recalls having headaches and stomachaches around days 3-5 following her injection, and beginning on day 7, she also started to notice some injection site itching and induration.  The localized swelling and redness increased during days 7-10 following her COVID-19 vaccination, and over the last 6 hours, she also started to develop nausea. Her fatigue persists, but the headaches, stomachaches, and body aches have subsided.

Headed to doctor 6pm. Saw a PA who said symptoms were not from vaccine when I asked about possibility because of my Hashimotos Thyroiditis. They gave me a steroid shot and called in scrip for Medrol Pack. Later that evening I started also having bad flares of my asthma. Also continued on Benedryl. 01/05/21- started Medrol Pack and continued antihistamines. Very fatigued. 01/10/21-finished Medrol. Still slight welt on right cheek but everything else pretty good. 01/20/21- mid morning noticed welt growing in right cheek and eyes puffing up. By 5pm itching has returned. By 7pm there are now welts and hives on both cheeks and they are  red and hot....asthma flaring badly. Took 30mg prednisone from my medication used for asthma. 01/21/21- things have calmed down redness wise but lots of fatigue. Took 20mg Prednisone. 01/22/21- back to doctor, another Medrol pack. 01/27/21- finished second Medrol pack. Still having slight welts and hives.

I was immediately taken to the ER and monitored for about 2 hours.  During that time I had about 4 episodes of my heart rate going very high. I was told 120-150 beats/m. I was also told that I had PVC&#39;s and PAC&#39;s. I was released after 2 hours and had  another episode of a  fast heart rate on my way home. Since then I have had daily episodes of fast heart rate but not as long and not as intense.  Last episode was 2 days ago.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.

                                                Side effects started the same day I received the vaccine, which were reported on the V-safe app.  Started with very sore arm, within 24 hours progressed to extreme fatigue, joint and body aches, loss of taste and headache. I also experienced some mild nausea. By Wednesday evening, I began to experience heart palpations which I listened to as a nurse which sounded like PVC&#39;s. I have never had this happen to me before. I assessed my vital signs and noted that as the arrhythmia progressed, my O2 sat level began to decrease and my pulse began to increase. I could hear a definite pause in my heart rhythm. Within an hour, I had chest pain in the area of my left chest over my heart which progressed into a feeling of pressure as if someone was standing with a foot on my chest. As time went on, this sensation radiated into my back at an angle from left to right. It was at this point that I had my father take me to the emergency room. When I got there, my pulse was in the low 100&#39;s and my blood pressure was 230/130. I have never had this happen to me before. I ended up on a nitroglycerin drip. My magnesium level was low and my sodium level was low normal.   I was kept in the emergency room until Thursday evening then transferred to Progressive Care Unit where I remained until early evening on Friday.I was sent home on 2 different cardiac medications, Coreg and Lisinopril. I am to follow up with my PCP and a cardiologist. Both are brand new to me. I am now feeling better, but I am very reluctant to have the second covid vaccine. Also, the Hospital does not know what happened to me. (Facility where I received my Covid vaccine.)

                                                Moderna dose 2 received at 1605. Patient reported funny taste and throat tightness. Oral diphenhydramine liquid 25mg was given. Tongue swelling and mild stridor were noted, prompting administration of an epinephrine pen and EMS was called. SpO2 noted to be in high 70s, along with persistent symptoms, so she was given an additional epinephrine pen as well as 100mg IM hydrocortisone. She was started on a 15L non-rebreather mask, IV was placed in the left antecubital space, and intubation kit was pulled from cart. Tongue and stridor improved after these doses of epinephrine and hydrocortisone. Blood pressure 190s systolic from 170s systolic after first epinephrine dose, with HR 116 at this point, and SpO2 99%. As EMS arrived, diphenhydramine 25mg IV was administered. At that point, tongue size and stridor were noted to have worsened again, so a third epinephrine pen was administered prior to EMS transport. Patient received racemic epinephrine inhalation nebulizer in EMS. Further treatment administered in ED: LR, dexamethasone and famotidine. Patient admitted later that day for further monitoring given hypertensive status. Put on scheduled cetirizine, famotidine, and dexamethasone and PRN albuterol and racemic epinephrine. Throughout her stay, patient continued to improve with stable vital signs and normal breathing. She was monitored for a total of 2 days and discharged home on 1/29.

                                                On or about 09:40-09:45 I felt a heaviness on the left side of my tongue and a general unwellness feeling, the heaviness persisted  and then as then somewhat of a continued presence that did not go away, later followed by a metallic taste in my mouth.  As I previously had a reaction to the first H1N1 vaccine years ago, I notified the person administering the vaccine before hand and also the nurse after the vaccine who was making her rounds.  I called her over to left her know I felt a little off/different, and described what I was feeling.  She escorted me to a private area where I was further assessed and given Benadryl 25mg po x 2.  The feeling never left my tongue and reportedly there was notation of questionable welts on the left side of my tongue. .I was able to speak clearly and swallow.  I was monitored and then discharged in the company of two of my colleagues (one an ICU nurse who works with me, and the other an ICU MD/anesthesiologist) who happened to be getting their vaccinations at the same time.  The tongue feeling did not leave me until late the next day and my lips felt a little off that night of the vaccine and the next day.  I continued to take the Tylenol and allegra as well as Benadryl.  By Friday night(1/8) I was feeling better, enough to work the weekend. Tylenol helped greatly for pain at injection site.  Today (1/12) I&#39;m feeling not my best and  tired like yesterday but I had a busy weekend at work (RN in the COVID ICU), some malaise and achy (maybe my fibromyalgia or the weather), minor headache and fatigued, had a minor sore throat this am that has resolved, and Tylenol has resolved the headache.  Not sure if this needed to be included but I thought I&#39;d mention it.

                                                Nothing until Dec 30 9:30 a.m. I developed angioedema and I had a flash like red rash; hot over my whole upper body. Palms of my hands were flame red and painful. Went to ER - that day (30th)- husband took me. I took Benadryl 50 mg right away. ER gave me Decadron 8 mg PO and Racemic Epi Aerosol treatment and got lactated ringers; IV fluid. Treatments resolved issue. Dec 23 I was negative for COVID nasal swab test (as husband had been positive for it); Dec 26, I was positive for COVID nasal swab (had to test to go to work).I had no COVID symptoms. The 30th is when I developed the allergic reaction. About 31st - started having ear pain and lymph nodes swollen on opposite side of shot. January 3rd, 2021 Went to Urgent Care and I had an ear infection. January 3 had an ear infection. I never get an ear infection normally.
