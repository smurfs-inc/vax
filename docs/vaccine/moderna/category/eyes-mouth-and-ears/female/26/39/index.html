I was talking to people that were not there. I felt completely out of control. The only thing that helped was forcing myself to focus on the TV, which was extremely difficult. Symptoms started to die down around 3 AM, but did not go away. I slept for 4 hours.  1/20 8 AM- felt like and still feel like I am not in reality, I feel disassociated with my body (like its not mine), slightly out of control of my thoughts, I see subtle black and white flashing like last night but not as intense, paranoia like last night/not as intense, cant concentrate.

                                                I developed a rash on my left arm about an inch below the injection site on January 18th 2021, 11 days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. It was about the size of a nickel and the next day it grew to the size of about an inch tall and two inches wide. It was warm to the touch and splotchy. The next day it grew to about the size of the diameter of a sofa can and started itching. I had gone to the doctor the second day of the rash and they suggested that I get a covid test, which came back negative, and to put heat on it and some antibiotic ointment on it and watch it. I called the doctor the next day because it grew and was now itchy. I also had an itchy mouth. The doctor suggested that I take an antihistamine twice a day for 7 days to see if that helps. I started this last night, January 20 2021. Today is the 4th day, the rash has not grown and is no longer itchy and my mouth is no longer itchy.

My throat started to hurt really bad and I felt like I could not breathe I looked in my mouth and my tonsils were swelling  and I had to give myself an epi pen so I could breathe. Went home called my doctor and told him what happen I was very flushed, headache, sore throat cough, and I started to warm up several hours later to 100.9. He told me to take steroids I was given when I had COVID and told me if I start to have other symptoms to go to the emergency room. He also said since I recently had gotten COVID I was not suppose to get the second vaccine yet.

Thought that it was a bit of a change due to just getting the shot. Then the next day I had breakfast and it had a hint of that smell and taste. but didn&#39;t think nothing of it thought they were just having a bad day. I still had that smell when i used the restroom. Seemed like when i got the second dose the smell became stronger. At work I walked into a certain room and it had that smell, which was weird cause it&#39;s a distinctive smell . It&#39;s hard to describe, but it&#39;s like a spoiled. sulfur, gasoline smell. I ordered the bread pasta bowl from and it had that gross smell so i couldn&#39;t eat it. I love peanut butter, but i noticed that foul taste. I smelt it and had a hint of that gross smell and a bit of PB. The coffee at work has that gross smell to it as well. Certain foods, drinks, or odors have that smell and taste to me. So I&#39;m pretty much trying to figure out what foods and drinks i can have and what places i can go to.  I get Covid around November, and i did loose taste and smell.

                                                Got the vaccine on Feb 17, 2021 at 9am. On Feb 18 at around 8:30-9 pm, left cheek started feeling uncomfortable and a bit swollen. The next morning, swelling was extreme and extremely painful to touch. It was difficult to eat from left side and to laugh and talk. Also, had chills and felt weak.  I scheduled an online appointment with Dr.  he mentioned the condition is called acute pericoronitis and he suggested that vaccine might have increased the immune response to any infection that might have happened underneath the left wisdom teeth which hasn&#39;t come out yet. [Note: Same response had happened when I got my MMR vaccine on Feb. 1, 2021]. He prescribed Amoxicillin 500mg for a week.  As of Feb 22. 11 pm, after taking Amoxicillin and ibuprofen, the swelling has bit reduced but the pain persists.

                                                Never had tinnitus before but it started about 2 or 3 weeks after getting the 2nd vaccine dose. I have not listened to or been around any loud noises that could have caused that to happen. I also haven&#39;t been sick recently or had any ear infections. It is a very noticeable ringing/static like noise whenever I am in a quiet room.

                                                Starting about 1 minute after vaccination I became extremely dizzy, blacked out/lost vision, had shortness of breath and a tight chest, lost feeling in my hand and fingers on my left side (the side I got the vaccine), was sweating but felt cold flowing through my body. These feelings lasted for about 30 minutes and my vision and feeling in my fingers and hand came back as the dizziness subsided and my body temp returned to normal.   Around 40 minutes after the vaccine I started experiencing echoing in my left ear (the side I got the vaccine on) and soreness around the vaccination site.   The echoing in my left ear lasted about 30 minutes and then subsided. The arm pain spread to the rest of my arm and I began to get a headache.  About 4 hours after the vaccine I began to experience intense back, hip, foot and hand pain making me unable to do any regular activities. The back pain feels like intensely sharp pain in my spine and hurts to the gentle touch. I previously had no back pain prior to the vaccine. The muscles surrounding my spine up to my shoulders were also painful/sore.  This pain subsided after 6 days. On about the 4th day after the vaccine I began experiencing underarm and breast pain on the side I got the vaccine.  It is now exactly 1 week since my vaccination and I am still experiencing the underarm and breast pain.  I have experienced lethargy since vaccination.

The numbness/tingling feel is isolated to left lip and chin and slightly feeling occasionally of the left gums. Touching region makes the region feel icy cold. It feels as thought the lip and chin is enlarged and hypo-tone and cold. When a nurse examined lower lip and chin noticed no change in tone or temperature. Symmetrical facial expression.

Lymph nodes stayed swollen after first dose, got worse after second dose, and have been swollen since.   Swollen lymph nodes in neck, hard to breathe, went to hospital, told it was just the vaccine and to wait it out. Lymph nodes in neck went down in swelling after 2-3 days.  Irregular menstrual cycle, started approximately 2 weeks after first dose. Have had a menstrual cycle for 5 days every 9-12 days since first dose.  Hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms (lost vision, couldn&#39;t form sentences) on 5 Feb 21. Discharged after CT scan and MRI came back fine.

                                                Within 1.5 hours, I started getting a bad headache.  She was not hungry, was nauseated and was becoming clammy.  She tried to eat but it did not make it better.  When she got home, she continued to feel &#34;really bad like she was getting over the flu.&#34;  She slept for over 10 hours.  When she got up, she could not move her arm and her arm was sore at the injection (it was hard, a little swelling but was not red).  Then she started feeling worse with bad pain (like she had a stroke).  This was around 12 noon to 1 PM on 1/21/21.  Around 7 PM that night, she presented to the ER.  The ER doctor said he thought she was having a migraine but she has never had one before.  Her blood pressure was high at 127/110.  Her supervisor walked into the room and said her face was pulling and it looked like a stroke to her.  She reported severe pain from her ear to her neck on the right side of her head.  She left due to having to provide care to her newborn.  She went to hospital on 1/21/21 about 2100.   Her blood pressure was still high and she had a heart rate of 120 bpm.  She did lab work and CT scan.   ER doctor believed she was experience Bell&#39;s Palsy and that she had had a mini-seizure.  She provided prednisone 60 mg X 1 dose, Valtrex tid and shot of Toradol.  She prescribed Toradol for outpatient pain relief.

                                                The night of getting the first dose of Moderna, I woke up to my stomach having a burning and tingling sensation, severe nausea, fast heart rate, feeling like I was going to stop breathing and faint, my lips were numb. These symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes and then they resolved. I did not have any of these symptoms since it initially happened on 1.8.21 at 230am. I did not seek medical care at the time since my symptoms resolved. I did contact my doctor on 2.1.2021 about this and he stated the symptoms I described aligned with symptoms of a panic attack, but if I felt it was related to the vaccine that I can report it.

                                                Two days after my second dose of the vaccine, I noticed a small swollen area on my left eyelid. The following day, about 24 hours after I first noticed the swelling, my eye began swelling even more. Then the next morning it was even more swollen. I scheduled an Appt with my ophthalmologist and he confirmed that it was not an infection, but was an allergic reaction. I have no known allergies except contrast dye and have never had seasonal allergy symptoms. I could barely open my eye this morning. The symptoms have improved with Benadryl and a steroid topical.

                                                I got my covid 19 vaccine shot (Moderna) on 4/15/2021 on my left arm around 11:30AM After the vaccine I felt a discomfort, disoriented &amp; very sleepy &amp; tired. I slept, when I woke up that same evening I felt my neck &amp; my arm, all my of left side really hurt, a lot of muscle aching from my neck down to my arm, also my left ear hurt too.  I couldn?t sleep for long on the night of 4/15/2021 because of the muscle discomfort. I woke up on the morning of 4/16/2021 &amp; my arm &amp; neck was feeling a little better. Towards the afternoon I started to feel this aching on my middle part of my neck &amp; mid way of my back then towards the evening my left arm was way better but now the pain was on my right side of my neck &amp; arm, almost like the pain transition over to the other side. I couldn?t sleep at all on the night of 4/16/2021 because the pain &amp; muscle aching was now on the right side of my neck &amp; arm.  On the morning of 4/17/2021 I am still aching a lot when moving my neck left to right &amp; right to left and moving it in anyway it hurts a lot. My muscles on my neck &amp; arm ache a lot. I had to take time off work due to the vaccine date and recovery 4/15 4/16.

She called an urgent care who recommended Benadryl, which helped minimize the tingling sensation and swelling over the next 2 days. Over the following week she had soreness at her left jaw joint near her ear and some left eye dryness. No facial droop. Normal blinking and smiling. No facial muscle weakness noticed. She was not sick when she received the vaccine. No new medications. Tolerates NSAIDs normally without reaction. No facial fillers. Never had anaphylaxis before to anything -- foods, medications, injectables, other vaccines. No known PEG allergy. Has not used Miralax before.

                                                &#34;I received my first dose of the covid vaccine yesterday, January 4th around 3pm. I have not felt any major symptoms or side effects aside from pain at the injection site. This afternoon I noticed how sore my arm was and started looking up potential side effects of the vaccine to see how long I should expect pain. I was trying to practice lifting my sore arm and then started feeling light headed. My vision went blurry, my hearing was muffled, and I started to feel like I was going to faint and/or vomit. I tried drinking water to see if that would help and when it didn&#39;t I called over to my coworker to tell her I felt like I was going to pass out. She informed our boss, who called Employee Health. They both walked me downstairs to Employee Health.&#34;

                                                12/31 I had tingling in my throat and was observed in urgent care for two hours with no intervention. It went away by the time I went to bed that night. 1/8 I woke up with a sore arm, did not think much of it and went to work. It was sore all day and when I got home I undressed to take a shower and noticed that it was red, swollen and hot to the touch. I tried hot compresses as I suspected it was cellulitis and marked the borders. It had grown in size the nest morning (1/9) which is when I went back to urgent care and was prescribed 3 days of Keflex. The first dose reduced the swelling and pain in my arm, but by the end of the course of antibiotics it was still red 1/13 I went back to urgent care to be seen for the redness and tenderness. The NP suspected that it may be an immune reaction rather than cellulitis and gave me a single oral dose of decadron with instructions to follow up in 3-4 hours by sending in a picture, and if it did not get better to fill a longer prescription for Keflex. At this point I have taken the prescription to the pharmacy and am waiting until after work to pick it up and begin the script.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

                                                First dose of Moderna vaccine received on 1/11/21 Monday on my right arm. The following day 1/12/21 Tuesday I started having itchy rashes on my left ear, along with right arm soreness. The rash on my left ear gradually progressed and spread as days go by until 1/15/21 Friday. I woke up with swollen ears, hives on my face, neck, chest, and upper body. On Saturday morning 1/16/21, my symptoms worsen with more itchy red rashes. On top of the rashes, my lymph node on my left neck felt swollen and tender. Also, I had a weird sensation in my throat that was not going away like something was stuck. After a TeleVisit, I went to the ER that day and got medical treatment. I was given Benadryl, Pepcid, Dexamethasone and IV fluids. Then I was sent home with Cephalexin, Prednisone, Benadryl, and Epi Pen. Right now, I still have symptoms of rashes on my face, ears, and chest but they wax and wane. I can feel it itching beneath my skin even if they are not showing. With my ears, I can say that they are not swollen and are less red now. I have no other known exposure but the Moderna vaccine. I do not have any known allergy either but to bee stings.

                                                I am a MD student who got the first dose of the moderna vaccine on 1/4/2021. I had no immediate reaction other than arm soreness. A couple weeks after my first vaccine, I had a reaction when drinking miralax. Within ~5 minutes of having a few sips of a 17g solution, I had throat tingling/tightening, sense of impending doom, cough, dyspnea, nausea, fecal urgency, and intense chills with shivering. I stopped drinking the solution and my symptoms eventually resolved on their own (the chills and nausea took the longest, about 1.5 hours) - I didn&#39;t even think to take benadryl because it wasn&#39;t clear to me at the time if I was really having an allergic reaction (no hives, no vomiting - but in retrospect I&#39;m concerned). I&#39;ve had miralax in the past without any issues. I&#39;ve never had a vaccine adverse reaction. I have no history of atopy.

Eye doctor to the next day: she said she sees it in virus infected people. She took a picture of the inside of my eyeball. Told me to Treat with Tylenol, put ice on it and wait to see. It was about four days after vaccine everything resolved.  I had the second dose  Today around 7:00 am  and it came back - around 12:30 PM - pain and enlarged blood vessel. I do have a lazy eye in the left eye that I was born with.

On Friday Jan 15 the pain in my injection site improved, but the pain moved to my right collar bone and right side of neck muscles. On Jan 16 the pain returned to the injection site and increasingly got worse in my collar bone and neck. The pain continued to worsen and become intolerable on 1/20. On 1/20 I was having pain in my injection site, collar bone, neck muscles, and my throat was sore and hurt to swallow. I went to the ER . After going to the ER and waiting for medications to be ready at the pharmacy the pain moved into my ear and I had a severe ear ache for two days. My symptoms improved after 2 days with ibuprofen 3x/day, muscle relaxers 3x/ day, Benadryl and lidocaine patches. The pain was localized to the right side of body and did limit the ability to complete ADLs

Within an hour she started to have some mild numbness around her mouth and tongue.  The next day she still has some mild numbness around the mouth and some tingling of her tongue.  She has had similar issues before due to fibromyalgia and has had a malar rash that comes and goes and has tested positive for lupus in the past.

She took oral diphenhydramine about 1 hour later, and itching resolved after about 20 minutes (total time about 70-80 minutes).  She did not seek any attention at the time, since she sometimes has similar symptoms when she eats in restaurants and is unsure of the ingredients, and attributed symptoms to anxiety.   At this time, we are unsure if she should receive her 2nd dose, or wait for a different vaccine.  Please reply if possible.

                                                I received my shot at 6:53pm. I went to the waiting room and waited until my time was up, I was released from my observation station at 7:11pm. Staff did ask me how I was feeling I had no signs or symptoms upon being released. I left the facility feeling great had no issues at all. I went to pick up my dinner at 7:45pm drove home. When I arrived home my lips started to tingle, and my face was starting to swell up. I inspected the rest of my body for any rash called my mom and read over the fact sheet that was given to me at time of shot. As per the directions regarding the risk of an allergic reaction I called my primary care doctor because my face was beginning to swell, and my throat started to feel scratchy. My primary care doctor called me back and advise I go to the ER immediately to be monitored for an allergic reaction.  I arrived in a Hospital just before 9pm and checked in at the ER. The doctor saw me quickly.  By the time the doctor saw me at the ER my face was bright red I had developed a rash all over my chest and back and on the injection site, my lips were swollen and had mild throat swelling. She gave me a high dose of prednisone and 2 Benadryl&#39;s.  They continued to monitor me for a while until they felt better and discharged me with a epi pen and other meds.

By 9:30am the itching had spread to my whole face, lips, roof of the mouth and tongue. The supervising nurse followed protocol and alerted our health team as well as 911. I was transported to Hospital ER via ambulance where I was treated with Benadryl and ZyTEC at 10:30. I was observed by the staff for any more adverse reactions, and was cleared to be released at 12:30pm.  At no point did I have trouble breathing, and all my vitals were stable throughout the event.

Woke up around 4-5a.m. to neck/head pain, tense muscles on head/neck and notable pains in the jugular region. Very sensitive skin and muscle aches at this time. getting up to grab ibuprofen caused initial worsening of head pains that quickly subsided as blood pressure issue(?) symptoms came on (blotchy vision, lightheadedness, notably diminished hearing). took around 20 minutes to realize head/neck pain seemed to be caused by stiffness from an unusual amount of intense teeth grinding in my sleep. Waited around an hour and a half while drinking plenty of water and taking a single dose of ibuprofen along with a second dose of clonazepam before feeling comfortable/safe enough to go back to sleep.

                                                I am twenty-eight years old, young, healthy active girl. I have always been into fitness and yoga. I live a generally healthy lifestyle. I have been a singer, a dancer, and a flight attendant! I decided sign up for the COVID-19 vaccine in order to help our world fight against this pandemic. I wanted to protect my family and friends to eradicate this virus once and for all. It was with no hesitation did I jump at the opportunity to get this vaccine when it became available to me on February 12th, 2021 at the Convention Center. As soon as I received my shot I proudly posted my photo with tears in my eyes letting the world know that we were one human closer to a COVID-19 free world. I was Moderna proud.   My entire family had already received their Moderna vaccines because I come from a family of nurses, but none of them had experienced any side effects. I was confident I would be in the clear after their clear symptom free vaccine. Immediately following my vaccine my arm was a little sore, as expected. However, I did experience fatigue and mild leg cramps in my calves. One very odd symptom was that I could taste the vaccine in my mouth, like a metallic, strange taste, which I reported to my family, but everyone just laughed it off. The leg cramps went away after a day or two as well as the taste, but the fatigue continued throughout the week. I felt these symptoms were pretty average. I signed up for the V-Safe reporting system and put in my report and thought nothing of my initial vaccine symptoms.   Things took a very strange turn on the morning of February 20th, 2021 at about 10am. I woke up and my face was numb, tingling all over, twitching in different parts of my face pretty severely and uncontrollably. By 4pm the tingling moved into both of my arms and hands and by 5pm it moved into both of my legs. Shortly after the cramping and twitching began in both of my legs and I lost the ability to walk, lift my legs, and just the ability to feel my legs at all. I could not walk.  Obviously concerning, I thought I was originally having a reaction to a medication I had been taking for over a year called, Topamax, a nerve pain medication which can cause numbness and tingling as a side effect. I called my prescribing physician and he immediately ruled out the possibility of a reaction to this medication due to the length of time I had been on this medication, that I had not missed a dose, I had not increased or decreased the dose, and I had not experienced a reaction like this in the time that I had been taking the medication. He recommended I keep an eye on my symptoms and go to an emergency room if things worsen.   Overnight, my symptoms remained the same. I woke up on Sunday, February 21st, 2021 and I still could not walk, I could not feel my legs. My legs were still twitching and cramping. My face was still numb and tingling, but the twitching had stopped in the face. My hands had stopped tingling. At this point my mother who is a nurse suggested that I call Moderna, the vaccine provider, to report a possible side effect of the vaccine. Upon contacting Moderna, the company thought that it could possibly be a reaction between the Topamax medication and the vaccine, but they had no current information about these two having any interactions. They thanked me for reporting and told me to go to an emergency room if my symptoms continued or worsen.   Throughout the day on Sunday, February 21st, my symptoms remained. I was able to get to my feet, but I walking like a newborn baby giraffe or as my mother described, like a 105 year old woman. I was unable to feel my legs completely, lift them, move them without lifting them with physical help of my arms moving them. At this point on Sunday night I decided to contact my Primary Care Physician. She noted that this sounded similar to Guillain-Barre and that I sound immediately go to an Emergency Department before the symptoms get any worse. It was late on a Sunday night and I was unable to drive myself, so I waited.   Overnight on Sunday into Monday I began experiencing light flashes in my eyes, heart races, lower back pain, and worsening cramping in my legs. I knew that I needed to seek treatment in an emergency room.   On Monday, February 22nd, 2021 I was taken to the Emergency Room Department. They conducted blood work and a physical examination, but did not want to proceed with any MRI?s or CAT scans. The ER the doctors were baffled. They could not figure out what was causing my paralysis other than the vaccine was the only new thing that had been introduced to my body, but they could not verify or diagnose anything. They let me go with a referral to neurology.   While we were sitting in the ER my cousin, a nurse anesthetist at another local hospital, called my mother who was with me with some very alarming news. Her co-worker, had experienced the same symptoms back in December and was just going through recovery after his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by the CDC there had been 19 reported cases through the CDC where after the first dose of the vaccine people have reported numbness, tingling, and the lose of the ability to walk after receiving the first dose of the mRNA vaccine, both Moderna and Pfizer. Her co-worker was also in the same age range as myself, very healthy, young, active. He was officially diagnosed with Transverse Myletis. He has taken a full two months to regain the ability to walk and still has numb patches on his legs. He walks very slowly, but is walking. He returned to work, but cannot return to his normal life working out and being active because he does not have the strength. He was told not to get the second dose of the vaccine.   There are unreported cases in this area by physicians who do not know where to turn with this information. It is hard to link these symptoms and cases because they are so obscure, but these same symptoms are occurring with those who have also had COVID-19. When I was being seen for an EMG test of my legs the physician performing the test said to us, ?I have a patient who received the vaccine and has the symptoms, maybe I should report it!?. My Grandmother?s physician just last week just sent a patient of hers with the same symptoms to neurology. I think this uncommon side effect is more common than is being reported and no one knows where to turn with the information.   I finally got into the head of Neurology. I was told, ?it?ll probably get better?, basically saying that they don?t know what they can do and they are at a loss for knowing what this is and why this is happening to people after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. Doctors don?t have answers and the vaccine companies aren?t offering information to help link these side effects together. The physician told me not to proceed with the second dose of the vaccine due to neurological side effect that I have had. I should benefit from the first dose and it is not safe for me to get the second dose from this side effect.   I was unable to walk for weeks since this began on Feb. 20th. It is just now that this week I am slowly able to move my legs, but they are still very numb and heavy. I haven?t been able to drive or live my normal life. I cannot use stairs, walk long distances, stand for very long periods of time. I am twenty-eight years old and I walk like an eighty year old woman, wobbly.   I have reported my case to CDC, V-SAFE, Moderna. The CDC said they would be in contact with me due to my report of extreme adverse side effects via the V-SAFE report, but I have not heard anything from them as of today.  These are the uncommon side effects that need to be heard and reported. I don?t know why they are being ignored because I have been left without answers and without hope.

                                                The patient did report swelling, induration and pain at the injection site. The patient  reports onset of headache, fever of 100.6, chills, body aches, night sweats, and malaise within a couple of hours of receiving dose 2 of her Covid 19 vaccine.  Due to how she felt, she went to bed soon after, and slept until the next morning. Upon waking up she noticed resolution of all her symptoms except for night sweats, and malaise.  She continued feeling hot and having night sweats but did not appreciate having a fever.  She also reports  the onset of significant facial swelling, periorbital swelling and swelling of her hands and feet, basically her entire body.  She also reports an onset of &#34;foul smelling&#34; diarrhea.  Her chronic eczematous areas which are her eyebrows, posterior neck, and scalp became more itchy and flaking and peeling.  She developed new areas of eczema and itching over her torso located at her mid axillary areas from her braline down to her waist area.  She also reports the onset of browniish red/ amber colored urine since receiving the vaccine. She continued to flake and peel over her eyebrows and cheeks in  continuously and in large amounts for the next 10 days.  She reports taking no antihistamines, or antipyretics.  She went to urgent care and was treated with 0.5% clobetasol cream which after 2 applications to her face caused a chemical, sun burn like reaction and more severe swelling over her cheeks and periorbital areas.  A photo shows that her left eye was so swollen it was half closed and the skin color was purplish. She returned to urgent care on March 11, 2021 and was prescribed a medrol dose pak.  She started it right away and her facial swelling improved.   On March 13 she came to see me.  with improvement in her swelling, peeling and flaking.   She was noted to have a fever of 101.6, then it was 100.6 after recheck and finally 99.6 before the end of her appointment.   It isn&#39;t clear whether her temp decreased because her medrol taken earlier that morning had kicked in or by removing her sweatshirt and being out of the sun allowed her to sweat and decrease her core body temperture to that level.She was asked to continue checking her temp which she reported as 99.8 on March 13, 100.6 on March 14, and 100.5 on March 15.  She has been instructed to check her temp everyday for the next 14 days.  Her urinedipstick showed 1&#43; bilirubin and ketones with trace blood and all other indicators were negative.  Patient was sent for stat bloodwork to evaluate for possible hemolysis.

                                                I have noticed an alteration in my taste of peanut butter only. Peanut butter of all brands gives a foul metallic type taste that invades my mouth AND nose like fumes. No other reaction as far as I can tell occurs. No hives no itching no swelling. I was taking no new medications at that time and was not sick. I have never had any issues eating Peanut butter and I am not currently pregnant.

                                                Extremely sharp head pains and nausea started Tuesday (4 days after receiving the Vaccine) at 0245 AM. Thursday night around 0930 PM I noticed the swollen lymph nodes in the shower. After further investigation I noticed there were three almond sized swollen nodes (largest and most painful was in the left Clavicle and the other two were in the jugular area. Unfortunately after palpitations the nodes became extremely agitated and pain radiated from the neck down into the fingers in the left arm. On Friday (19 Mar I went to the clinic where I was tested for COVID and was negative) Over the weekend approximately 10-15 more Nodes became enlarged, followed by blurred vision in right eye and more intense headaches. 22 March I was sent to the ER for Lab work (testing white blood cell count) and an ultrasound of the lymph nodes .

On 1/7/2021 I started to feel short of breath and run down. Sinus infection symptoms. I was sent home from work to get a COVID swab. That evening I lost my taste and began to feel achey. Negative test on 1/10/21. Saw urgent care on 1/9/21 for Covid swab and visit. He diagnosed viral and was sure I was positive. On 1/11/21 my energy returned and I wasn?t achey. Congestion and cough. By 1/13/21 felt fine other than lingering wet cough. This morning, 1/14/21 I noticed my arm itched and looked at it and I?ve got a small red rash around the injection sight and tenderness on palpation.

By 96 hours after vaccination, there was an uncomfortable feeling in my throat as I was breathing which lasted consistently for about 24 hours. Which in that time, I was able to get into contact with health care professionals (Dentist and Ear Nose Throat Dr. )  Who suggested Benadryl, contact PCP, and make sure to have EPI pen.  After taking benadryl for 12 hours, it seemed to have gone down. 6 days after vaccine (day 5 was a holiday), I was able to have a TeleMed appointment with a PA, spoke with my PCP.  Day 8 I was able to see my doctor who confirmed it was an allergic reaction and prescribed a steroid to help my throat/tongue to continue to go back.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/19/2021 at my place of employment. Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

                                                Beginning when I woke up the following morning, I had a very severe headache. It lasted all day until I went to sleep. Figured it was from the vaccine and would be gone the next day. It was still there when I woke up again... and the severe headache and extreme light sensitivity in my eyes lasted for 20 straight days. It kept me from being able to work fully and had to cancel many of my client bookings. I had 2 days of no headaches- felt great- Jan 21st and 22nd. Then again through today it has been there. I can?t describe it very well as it feels like it?s all over and the pain is almost unbearable at times. Even when the headache is lessened/subdued by darkness or ibuprofen, I still feel it strongly in my left temple/behind left eye at all times. I haven?t experienced headaches like this ever before in my life, even though I?ve had random headaches here and there in the past. They have never been there when I wake up in the AM though and sleep has always made them go away previously. Although I can?t imagine this is specifically from the vaccine, it also seems like the timing is so related that I was advised to file a report here.

                                                The reason I came to this site to fill out adverse events is for lower right lip numbness that started about 30 hours after the shot, but I also did have other side effects starting the first day that I will list as well.  I have never experienced anything like this numbness  before in my life, and I am 99% positive it is due to receiving the Moderna vaccine.  I did not find facial numbness as a possible side effect of the vaccine listed, so I searched ?facial numbness COVID vaccine? and was able to find that only  4 of the 30,000 participants in the Moderna trials experienced facial numbness, and that only 3/4 received that active vaccine over the placebo, and so was not considered to be a side effect of the vaccine. I also read that they appeared to be cases of Bell?s Palsey, which I do not believe to be what I am experiencing, because I do not seem to have any symptoms of drooping, just a numb sensation. I woke up around 4:30AM on Wednesday (got vaccine on Monday at 2:30pm) with my lower right lip completely numb. The lower left lip had full feeling, as did my entire upper lip. Friday afternoon (2 days later on the 15th) I finally started to get some feeling back on the inside on my lower right lip. Over the next week (it?s been 12 days now since I first woke up with my lip numb), I have slowly regained a little more sensation each day. While I have about 95% of my feeling/sensation back in my lower right lip, there is still some numbness. Also important to note that while this symptom has been annoying, it has not been painful in any way.   An adverse side effect that happened immediately after getting the vaccccine was that my arm started to itch around the injection site, spanning about 3 inches out in every direction. My arm also got very slightly puffy (only right at the injection site), and moderately pink/red in the same area. They kept me just a little longer than the 15 minutes, but I had no breathing issues, and stated that I felt fine, and was able to leave.   Adverse side effects that started day one of getting the vaccine and lasted 2-3 days: -Severe cotton mouth/dry mouth and throat that started on my drive home about 40 minutes after receiving the injection  -Severe fatigue that started about 2 hours after receiving the vaccine (could not even keep eyes open the first day, and had to call out of work for the next two days) -Moderately severe arm numbness at the site of injection that I noticed around 6 hours after injection.  This symptom bothered me less than others due to lifelong chronic pain, but it was still very difficult to raise my arm to grab things (moved slow like a sloth to be able to push past the soreness).

This writer instructed her to sit down.  This writer then requested assistance from RN.  As RN approached where patient was sitting, patient stated &#34;yeah I&#39;m going to faint&#34; she then fell forward from her chair onto the floor, with the top of her head hitting the floor first.  RN instructed staff to call the Rapid Response Team who was unavailable.  This writer gathered the anaphylaxis/reaction supplies that were on hand.  Patient&#39;s body postured and at that time RN rolled her onto her side.  Patient quickly regained consciousness.  Vitals were taken and stable. Patient was given the opportunity to be seen in the ED multiple times but she declined.   She stated that her lips felt &#34;tingly&#34; and was given 50mg/20mL Diphenhydramine oral solution.  She remained in the COVID vaccination clinic at Medical Center for observation for 40 minutes, at which time her husband retrieved her and escorted her home.

                                                Around 12:45pm today (1/28/21) I fainted after getting up from using the restroom. My partner was with me and said that after I got up I began shaking and he helped me to the ground where I continued to &#34;shiver&#34;, as he called it, for another few seconds before going limp. Once I came to (a few seconds later) I felt very confused at where I was and had a pounding headache and my ears were ringing loudly. It was all I could focus on. After that my partner helped me to bed where he continued to check on me and I slept for 5 hours.

Then the next day I felt fine in terms of flu symptoms were gone, but I started to develop swelling in lips and a rash on my arm near the injection site. This morning (3 days later ) I have extreme hives all over my face and moderate hives all over my body. They itch.

The building where vaccines were given was 75 degrees that morning the client was bundled up with a winter hat, coat, sweatshirt, and gloves.  When she first stated she wasn&#39;t feeling good we had her remove all her outwear so she could cool off, she immediately began trembling uncontrollably. Vitals were taken 144/78, pulse 125,  4 minutes later 136/74 pulse 100,  5 minutes later 130/82 pulse 80. During this time client continued to tremble. She voiced her anxiety for getting shots and also states she hadn&#39;t even anything yet that day.  She was given 2 large glasses of water which she drank both of them . By 11:00 am she was no longer having any symptoms.

                                                Around 5:30 PM I began experiencing normal symptoms like headache and muscle ache. At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

                                                10 minutes after the vaccine my tongue began to feel weird, I became anxious and felt disoriented.  This passed after about 30 minutes.  8 days after the vaccine I developed a big red itchy spot on my upper left arm.  It is on the interior of my arm and not where they administered the vaccine.  It has been present for 4 days and appears to be improving in color.

                                                I took out my contact lenses and my eyes became very itchy around 11:00PM. Around 10 minutes after initial itch, eyes and eyelids began to swell and turn red.  Eye balls were bloodshot and difficult to keep open. Redness appeared around the eye area. Placed a cold compress on infected eye area, kept eyes closed as much as possible and took a Benadryl. Went to bed. Next morning at 7:30AM  redness has decreased around the eye area. Eye lids are sore and eyes are still slightly bloodshot. I have refrained from inserting my contact lenses and am wearing by glasses.

                                                About 5 hours after my shot, I started to have a horrible headache.  As the evening progressed, my arm was extremely sore and a little red around the injection site.  Over the next couple of days I continued to have a headache and also ended up having nausea, muscle soreness, some food started tasting not right (I did not lose taste or smell), cough, &amp; horrible fatigue.   I went to Urgent Care on 1/17/21 due to feeling so poorly and had to miss work that evening.  While at Urgent Care, the doctor provided me with cough medication that also had something in it to help with nausea.  They also said that they would be doing a COVID test since I was having some symptoms and even though it was probably from the shot, they wanted to test anyway.  The test finally came back as negative.  A week after the shot was done, my arm turned horribly red and swollen around the injection site.  Over a few days, the spot on my arm grew a little bit but was just more so irritating that it was itching/hurting.  By week #2 after having the injection, the redness in my arm as well as all of the symptoms, minus the fatigue, went away totally.

I called my doctors office who advised me to go straight to the hospital where I was admitted right away and given benadryl, apinephrine, famotidine, methylprednisolne, and racepinephrine around noon. I was release around four only to have swelling in my face tongue and arms, around 11pm when I went back to the hospital for more of the same treatments and was again released around 6 am on Wednesday the 24th. I have been suffering with headaches, dizziness tiredness and pain in the bottoms of my feet for the last four days.

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

                                                I received the vaccination on 1/14 and started to get an itching sensation that night - nothing noticeably or concern and was able to go to sleep. The next morning I was very itchy and red and started to break out in hives that started to get worse and spread through my body. I took Benadryl throughout the day and at night to help my sleep. On Saturday morning my eyes were swollen and red, I had severe hives all over my body and had to go to the ER for some type of relief. This was immediately after I woke up, the right side of my body was extremely hot and I went to the restroom and looked in the mirror and didn&#39;t recognize myself. At the ER, they put me on Prednisone - to take 2 tablets for 3 days, Famotidine - taking 1 tab, 2 times a day for 5 days, and Benadryl, 1 tab, 3X a day until the symptoms subside - It is currently 1/19 and my skin will start to heat up, primarily in my hands and start to itch, but no more hives or anything severe.  I am currently pregnant with my first child, due date 7/7/2021. I have had no previous pregnancies, miscarriages, or abortions.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine waiting my 15 minutes it felt tingling and burning sensation from my shoulder across my clavicle bone towards my heart. First 5 day (Tuesday-Sunday) symptoms: swollen, sore, red, &amp; bruised arm at injection spot; body aches, joint  pain of knees, fatigue, no energy, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache, chills, nausea.  I felt better on the 6th day (Sunday), the injection site looked like it was healing and going back to normal on my shoulder. Then on 7th day (Monday) my injection spot started to itch and break out in a huge hive and little hives around it.  It turned into a bright red circle around the injection spot.  It was hot to touch and very swollen. On 8th to current day (11th) my arm keeps getting worse with the swelling, hotness, itching, &amp; redness, and spreading down my arm.

                                                Patient received the 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/28/20.  The next day, on 12/29/20, she developed a fever &gt;100, fatigue, chills, sore throat, new anosmia/dysgeusia, chest tightness, headache, GI symptoms, and nasal congestion.  When the symptoms did not resolve, she contacted her doctor on 1/2/21.  They referred her to get a COVID test and that test from 1/2/21 returned positive.  Follow-up on 1/4 showed symptoms stable.  No hospitalization required.  Treated with albuterol inhaler and pseudoephedrine.  Not believed to be related to vaccine, however reporting since my understanding is that VAERs is interested in reports of positive COVID cases following vaccination.

Later that evening I got a stomach ache, the chills/hot flashes, arm soreness and the shakes. Most lasted until the following morning when I got up at 6:15am for work. The following morning I was only experiencing shakiness and arm soreness. About a week in a half later, I developed a rash at the injection site that looked like two large red blobs. The rash was slightly itchy and lasted only a couple of days.

Took 1tablet of acetaminophen 325mg and 25mg diphenhydramine. At 01:00, Fever went up to 101.8 F. Body started aching, persistent pain at right and left ribs that come and goes. Headache especially behind the right ear that also comes and goes (felt like a stabbing pain). Pulse was consistently over 100.  The next day, temperature went down to 99F.

Pt states felt almost like an &#34;out of body&#34; experience, but she did feel pressure to the left side of her head as she fell off of her chair and her head hit the floor. This fall was witnessed by another patient, who flagged the medical staff for help. A medical assistant notified me of the incident and I went to examine the patient, who was sitting on the floor, alert and conscious. I asked the staff to get the patient an ice pack, which was placed to patient&#39;s forehead and back of neck, and glass of water. Patient is able to swallow.   A&amp;O x 3, HR 81 and O2 sat 98% on room air. EOMI, PERRLA. Auscultation of heart &amp; lungs was normal. No bony step-offs palpated. No tenderness upon palpation to patient&#39;s head, face and neck/c-spine. No visible contusions, abrasions noted. Normal ROM of all extremities and normal sensation. Observed patient over the course of 15 minutes and patient states she is feeling much better.

                                                After going to bed, I began to feel tingling in my face. Over the course of an hour the swelling in my right side of my face became so pronounced that my gums were hard affecting the shape of my lips. I got out of bed and brushed my teeth, flossed, mouthwashed and salt water rinsed wondering if I&#39;d maybe gotten something stuck in my teeth and went back to bed. By 1 am I was awoken by feeling like my teeth were going to fall out of my head it kept me up most of the night. I could feel my heart beating in my teeth. By morning, I had a small tear in my gums and the fluid had drained from the gums but there was an excess of tissue kind of hanging off my gums. I had typical mild fever and fatigue on Saturday, I took one dose of motrin. By Sunday the swelling was gone and my mouth felt better but I do continue to have some numbness on my upper right lip.

Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

                                                Patient participated in a mass vaccine event with the local school system administered by local pharmacy.  After the vaccine was administered the patient was instructed to wait 30 minutes so she could be observed by a school nurse.  She said she noticed her lips were beginning to feel numb and looked in the mirror and noticed her face was beginning to turn red.  The nurse came over to assess the patient when she noticed the patient was developing hives on her face and neck and her eyes were becoming swollen.  The fire department with a paramedic unit was on site and came over to assess the patient.  They did not administer any medications as their protocol did not call for medications if the patient was not having difficulty breathing.  In the meantime 911 had been called and an ambulance arrived on site.  The patient refused transport and the ambulance left the site.  The nurse, pharmacist, and school staff would not allow the patient to leave the site until further evaluation for approximately 30 more minutes.  The nurse and pharmacist insisted the patient receive 50mg of diphenhydramine orally, and she agreed to comply.  The patient&#39;s friend was on site and agreed to drive the patient home and stay with her for at least four more hours.  The friend was instructed to call 911 if any of the symptoms worsened.  The patient was provided with an additional 2 x 25mg diphenhydramine capsules to take in  case needed.   The nurse called the patient at 1pm, and the patient indicated her symptoms were resolving.  The nurse called the patient again at 3pm, and the patient indicated she felt much better. The pharmacist called the patient on 03/15/21 at 4:45pm for additional follow-up.  The patient indicated she felt &#34;wiped out&#34; all day on 03/13/21 but felt much better by 03/14/21.  The pharmacist instructed the patient that even though she did not have an anaphylactic reaction she should NOT take the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, and that she should not receive the Pfizer vaccine either.

My husband heard and ran to the bathroom. He held me and I fainted again in his arms. He called 911, while the medics were on the way I threw up very dry and hard throw up. I started to feel a little better after that. Medics said everything looked ok and did not take me to the hospital. The following morning we went to the hospital, got a cat scan and everything luckily came up fine. Currently, I have a terrible ear ringing and muffledness from the concussion.

                                                Patient states on day of vaccination she took 400 mg of ibuprofen due to the pain in her left shoulder around the injection site. Patient then woke up the next day (03/13/2021) and noticed that all of her fingers were more swollen than normal. Throughout the day, the patient reports that her finger swelling resolved and did have some facial swelling.  4 days later on 03/17/2021 the patient developed 3 pustules on her left shoulder at the injection site and another on her right scapula. The following day (03/18/2021), the patient began to have swelling around her eyes and lips. She saw her PCP that same day and was prescribed prednisone, Zyrtec, and hydroxyzine; however, the patient continued to develop mild pustules throughout her body.  She presented to the ED on 3/19/2021 for evaluation. The patient was given 10 mg of dexamethasone and recommended to switch to benadryl.  After discharge from ED, patient reports that her rash has continued to worsen as it is spreading diffusely all throughout her body. Patient specifically states that her rash spread from her left arm into her chest, then to her back, groin, face, and lower extremities. On 03/21/2021, patient reports that her pustules advanced into target lesions around her face along with developing some lesions in her mouth, as well. Patient also notes that her skin &#34;burns&#34; whenever she itches it. Patient then went in to be evaluated by a dermatologist and was sent to the ED for admission to the hospital.     Patient currently hospitalized and undergoing work-up/treatment.  Current treatment includes oral anti-histamine, analgesics, topical steroid, and IV fluids.

I kept saying i needed to go home, so he called an uber to my apartment. Nose was running, blurry vision, unable to walk alone when uber came to pick me and partner up. Kept seeing black and white stars when trying to cross the road to uber. Once I got home, I had watery stool in my underwear and had to stay on toilet for 30 minutes for watery stool to pass. Then kept alternating between feeling cold and hot while under blankets. Slept for 5 hours. Then felt fine. On Sunday, slept for about 15 hours - 18 hours. Throat kept hurting. Today, Monday, feel better but throat feels like there is a lump in it.

                                                10:47a went into a room to wait for 15 minutes directly after the injection. Began to feel somewhat dizzy right afterwards. Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

                                                Just over 24 hours after I received the COVID-19 vaccine I had a syncope episode while standing talking to others at work. I began feeling hot, started feeling like I was sweating, started seeing black and white lines, and then fainted. The symptoms came on very quickly. I did not remember falling and we believe I hit my head on the corner of a table when I fell, and I had to get 3 staples in my head. I have no other medical concerns at this time, and all of the test run at the ER showed no concerns. At the ER they ran labs, took a CT scan, and did an EKG. I was released from the ER after about 4 hours. I have had a 3 other episode previously when I felt like I was going to pass out, most recent March 2020, but they were linked to the flu and strep. This event has not been linked to either of those conditions at this time, and my doctor encouraged me to report it.

                                                I had a racing pulse, my throat was really itchy and tighter than normal ,  my lips were numb, my tongue was tingling.  This happened during the observation period and then I was sent to the ED.  About a week later, on the left arm, looked like I had hives, it was swollen and warm to the touch, pain went down into my wrist. I went to Urgent Care.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine my tongue started to swell and almost felt hairy. My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine: Symptoms after vaccination: Intense pain to my affected arm started around 5-6:00pm the day I received the vaccine. A little while after that I noted terrible body aches and intense chills. I took Meloxicam and Tylenol for the pain to my arm and the body aches. This helped a little.  I ended up going to bed at 7:00pm (same date) due to not feeling well. The chills were pretty intense going up and down my spine and I could not get comfortable in bed or sleep because I was freezing and aching all over.   I am not sure if I had a fever at the time because I felt so weak and chilled that I couldn&#39;t get out of bed but my eyes felt like they were burning. My husband said I was sweating and my skin was burning hot despite the fact that I felt extremely cold. I developed a headache around midnight that lasted until the afternoon the day after my vaccination. I took more tylenol , meloxicam, and benadryl for the pain/headache and I took a mid morning nap. I felt better and more myself by about 4:00pm the next day.  I did not need to receive any medical attention for these symptoms.

                                                Patient had an appointment for her first Covid vaccination today at 10:30am. Pt came in feeling fine but anxious about getting her vaccination. Pt also mentioned to both intern and I that she is a hypochondriac. She got her IM vaccination and sat down for 15 minutes as we monitored her. After her 15 minutes of sitting down in pharmacy area and being monitored by our intern and pharmacist, they asked how she&#39;s doing. Pt expressed she felt fine but had a dry mouth, and the intern told her to call 911 immediately if any shortness of breath occurred, but patient felt fine and left. About 25 minutes later she returned and expressed that she had a metallic taste in her mouth and was anxious about the shot. We asked her to sit down so we can monitor her further and she did. Five minutes later she expressed tongue swollen a little and a little difficulty swallowing but had no trouble breathing. At that time pharmacy intern and I (pharmacist) decided to give the epipen injection and patient agreed. We had the patient sit down for another 30 minutes as we monitored her. Minutes later, pt started to feel better as we continuously monitored her. During this time patient requested water due to dry mouth. We handed her a bottle of water but asked her to please sip and not take big gulps. After 30 minutes patient felt better. No swollen tongue, no difficulty swallowing or breathing and anxiety had been relieved. Patient was notified by pharmacy to call MD to let him know of reaction and was also told to call 911 immediately if have any further reaction. PT felt comfortable to leave at this point.

                                                Was fine immediately post vaccine. Drove home and proceeded with a normal rest of the day at home. Went to sleep around 10 pm. Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

                                                Currently pregnant when I received the first dose of the Moderna Vaccine on 1/22/21. At the time I was 6 weeks pregnant. My estimated dat of delivery is September 15, 2021.   The evening of 1/22/21 I experienced mild chills and tenderness around the injection area. 1/29/21, 7:30pm I experienced itchiness around the injection site. 1/30/31, 8:00am I checked my left shoulder and noticed that it was swollen and red in a 3x4 inch size around the injection area. As the day progressed I experienced more red patches that were itchy pop up at different areas of my body, including on my hands and wrists, on my butt and thighs, and on my knees and feet. I took a benadrly 25mg at around 8pm that evening. 1/31/21, 7:00am I woke up with facial swelling and numbness of both my upper and lower lip. I also felt itchy on my left hip. I went to the urgent care and I was advised to continue taking Benadryl as needed. Around 1pm I noticed more itchy spots had popped up near the injection site and on my butt. I took a benadryl around 2pm. My bottom and upper lip are still mildly swollen, however the swelling and numbness has decreased (3:25pm).

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/29 at 5 pm and was feeling fine afterwards with only a slightly sore arm at the injection site.   Then yesterday, 1/30 around 6 pm, I started to have a very fast heart rate, despite not exerting myself and only sitting down at the time. Between 6-6:45 pm, I had a heart rate between 125-140 bpm, according to my fit bit device that tracks my heart rate on my wrist. Anyways, after that I was going to the bathroom and started to feel nauseous, light headed, felt hot and chills like a fever, abdominal pain and vision issues (blackening in some spots and blurry on and off) so I went to lay down. I didn&#39;t vomit and the chills/hot fever feeling went away in 15 minutes. I also took my temperature and it was normal. My abdominal pain continued but the light headedness and nausea and vision issues subsided. I was unable to get up and do other stuff, so I just slept it off. I&#39;m feeling better this morning. I  had also drank about a half glass of wine (maybe 2 oz), so i&#39;m not sure if that contributed to it, but i&#39;ve never felt that way after drinking wine, especially that small of an amount. I had also drank this wine around 4 pm and that was 2.5 hours before I started feeling this way and did not drink anything on the day I received the injection.

                                                Swelling and mild pain/discomfort under both eyes in exact location where I had filler injections 16 months ago. Swelling peaked Saturday evening (1/30), then improved through 1/31 and completely gone by 2/1. Spoke with doctor on Saturday 1/30, who advised cold compress on the area. Did cold compress that evening.

                                                Woke up feeling very nauseated. Took a Zofran. While standing to get medication from cabinet my vision went completely black and face cold and clammy. I slowly laid down with feet above heart until it subsided and slowly went back to bed. My galaxy watch says pulse dropped to 40. Normally 60&#39;s. Later in the morning at 7am chills started and migraine with light aura (kind of like the pixels on an old tv). Took asa, tylenol, and drank water to help. Feeling hazy all day.

                                                After waiting my 15 minutes I got up to leave. I put my children in the vehicle and then called my husband. I noticed the tip and the right side of my tongue was tingly. I felt as if I had a lump in my throat. I looked in the mirror and my tongue was not red or swollen. I stayed in the parking lot and spoke with my husband incase I did have an anaphylactic reaction. My symptoms started getting better and fading around 9:45 AM, so I left the parking lot. I notified the vaccine clinic via text message of the reaction after I had already left the site. They offered me to see a provider, but the symptoms already started to go away, so he advised me to take benadryl when I got to my location.  Once I got to my location benadryl was no longer needed because the symptoms were gone. This was about 45 minutes to an hour after the vaccine was administered.

However, I got the second shot and tingling around my mouth and tongue continued with some heighted anxiety but no panic attack. Two weeks after the last shot the tingling has continued on and off feeling like neuropathy of the tongue and mouth. It typically last thirty minutes or so and then subsides. This has happened 3 x since getting the second shot 3 weeks ago.

Approximately 15 minutes post administration, the patient reported tingling around her lips. She agreed to take Benadryl 25mg PO. The patient reported feeling well upon leaving the site. I contacted the patient approx. 1 hour later to check in. She replied via email &#34;I am not feeling well but I am doing okay. I have a follow up appointment with my doctor this afternoon.&#34; I followed up again on Monday March 1st, and she replied, &#34;I saw my doctor late afternoon Friday. When I got home my face was puffy and my throat felt weird so she sent over a prescription for prednisone. Saturday I developed hives. I ended up seeing three doctors in total over the weekend, all said due to my reaction I should not be getting a second dose. I appreciate you emailing to check in. I&#39;m happy that now all of my symptoms have cleared and I am feeling much better. &#34; After this email the follow up concluded.

                                                I received my vaccine at 4:09 pm on Thursday, March 11th, 2021. At 4:45 pm I began to get visual abnormalities while driving home in the right quarter of my visual field. It started with perceived motion on the right quarter of my vision that I would compare to the visual effects that occur after staring at an optical illusion , and proceeded to reduced peripheral vision in that side that lasted for about 20 minutes. at 5:00 pm I noticed I was having difficulty reading and typing text messages in my phone, as it felt like I had extreme dyslexia and very low reading comprehension. At 5:35 pm I called my sister, a pharmacy student in Boston, to try to explain my symptoms, but found myself having extreme word aphasia. I could not describe what was happening to me and couldn&#39;t recall family members&#39; names, descriptive words, or the name of my dog. I tried to stay calm while she looked things up and began cooking and listening to a podcast, since my comprehension of spoken words was fine. My headache got worse and I took an ibuprofen by 6:00pm. My boyfriend called me at 6:36 pm to check on me, and I found myself talking fluidly to him on the phone. I called my sister to reassure her and the visual abnormalities and reading and speaking issues were all resolved. I took my temperature at 6:36, and it read 99.9 degrees fahrenheit.

I did not feel any side effects until later that night which included chills and body aches. However, throughout that evening and Thursday I had twitching of my eyes.   On the morning of Friday, 3/12 at around 9am (~48H after 2nd dose), I noticed it was weird to move my lips and remember that drinking coffee from the straw felt weird. It wasn&#39;t until 2:30pm when my husband and I were eating lunch that my husband noticed a drooping of the left side of my face.   We went to Emergency Department at 5:30pm and were seen by doctor who confirmed that it was Bell&#39;s Palsy on the left side of the face, the same side as the injection site.

                                                I was expecting to get the common side effects after my second dose, getting sick for a day about 12 hours after the 2nd dose. I did not get sick the next day, I just had the regular big red sore bump at the injection site. However, slightly more than a week after my 2nd dose, I started to experience double vision. Not blurry vision, but double vision, with one image on top of the other, both clear. At first it didn&#39;t bother me much, it was mostly happening in the mornings and in the evenings. Then suddenly, between the dates of 2/25 and 3/1, I started experiencing the double vision much more intensely and earlier in the day. It was not safe for me to drive, and it bothered me a lot, causing headaches and extreme nausea, I found myself going to bed at 6pm because I didn&#39;t want to be awake and deal with the side effects. I saw an Ophthalmologist (Dr.)  about the problem (not realizing it was a COVID-19 vaccine side effect) who diagnosed me with cranial nerve 4 palsy in the left eye.  I had to notify my job that I was unable to drive and that effected my work. Furthermore it was extremely stressful not knowing the cause or prognosis, and the worry over the medical costs for test and lab work. Since 3/2, the condition has been improving. There have been no other changes to my lifestyle or health that could account for this, other than receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. People need to know about the possibility of horrible side effects like this, it&#39;s worse when you don&#39;t know what&#39;s causing it or the prognosis.

The additional swelling is still relatively mild and I don&#39;t have any other unusual symptoms (just arm pain, headache, insomnia, and a low-grade fever/chills the night of 3/17).

                                                1. A very sore feeling inside of my right nostril that developed into an actual wound about two days after the vaccine on 3/5/2021. It has only just started to heal and feel &#34;normal&#34; as of 3/24/2021.  A strange cold sensation just to the right, lower side of my right eye. Every time my eyes well up, crying or just tearing up after yawning etc., I have a cold shooting sensation that begins at the corner of my eye and moves down my face about and inch. It&#39;s so cold and intense I always reach up to feel if I somehow have a tear on my skin already, but never do. This occurs whether tears actually leave my eye and move down my face, or even if I just tear up. It start occurring roughly two days after my first Covid-19 vaccine on 3/5/2021. My second shot is scheduled for 4/2/2021

I drank 1.5 L of water and put some topical Benadryl cream on the hives, these symptoms resolved. At 8pm I began to get a temperature (temp max 101.2 around 11:17pm), a very sore swollen arm, massive headache, and myalgia/arthralgia in knees bilaterally. On 1/5 temperature has subsided to low grade (99.2F) but I still don?t feel well and have no sense of smell with a runny nose.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Returns to clinic at 0739. Had first dose of Moderna vaccine at 0715 today.  She states that immediately after her lips felt tingly.  She states that she was driving home and she began to feel tingling and numbness into her face around her mouth.  Patient denies having any allergies. Was walking her to the ED and she was talking to nurse, all of a sudden she leaned forward and was coughing and grabbing her throat. Rapid response team called, patient transferred to ED. She gets influenza thoughts without difficulty.  She denies any current URI symptoms no history of heart or lung problems high blood pressure or diabetes.  She denies numbness or tingling in her hands currently.  Currently very nauseated. Patient was given some BENADRYL and some Zofran was watched she still complained of some perioral numbness some labs were obtained potassium is minimally low at 3.5 calcium is also low at 8.1.  This time I suspect this is more of an adverse reaction to immunization shot however if the tingling or numbness persists then a recheck of her electrolytes may be warranted follow-up primary care physician.

                                                Beginning Saturday morning, I began to experience hives, coming and going throughout the day. There were 2 significant episodes on Saturday, one Sunday morning, two throughout the day on Monday. Beginning Tuesday morning, I experienced hives that continued throughout the day. Starting around 1:00 pm, they moved from a more localized area on my upper trunk to covering my entire body, head to toe. I became hypotensive (lowest was 90/60), tachycardic (pulse rate ranging from 100-125), low grade temperature (100.4), noticed a tingling feeling in my lips, a new onset sore throat, and ringing in my ears. My pulse ox remained stable, no oxygen required. I took a claritin chewable approximately 10 minutes after onset of worsening symptoms, then 50 mg of benadryl 3 hours later.  I have continued to take 25 mg of benadryl BID since Tuesday and have remained without any new onset of hives. No medical admissions were required, although I do work in a medical clinic and close observation was available for me.  Only symptom remaining is fatigue, unsure if this is related to benadryl usage or remaining vaccine reaction.

At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

The vaccinating pharmacist checked the patient and she said her lips were tingling/numb. The vaccinating pharmacist came and got me in the pharmacy. I talked to patient, she said her breathing was fine but felt like she was floating. She began to become incoherent and at that point we got her on the floor and called 911. I did not talk to the EMTs. They transported the patient out of the waiting room.  We reached out to patient after she returned home she is feeling better and may of just had a panic attack. She is making an appointment with her primary care provider.

                                                I experienced nausea, redness in face and neck, with itchiness and flushed feeling within 20-30 minutes of receiving vaccine (started around 3:55pm). Felt cold with pale hands. Seen by ambulance crew at clinic site and given IV fluid, steroids and benadryl. Had dry mouth and itchiness in throat. Taken to hospital and developed red blotches on hands and arms.  I was given epinephrine around 5:30 when nausea,  dry mouth, and itchy throat did not subside. Discharged at 9:30.

                                                Face swelling and redness with lip tingling and tongue tingling later after eating a few bites of a home prepared meal that has been eaten several times before. Started eating around 7 pm, have picture of red and swelling face at 7:11 pm. Contents of meal were shrimp, homemade egg noodles, chicken stock, pork, and romaine.  No breathing problems and felt fine besides face warm ness and some anxiety over possibly developing a new allergy, as these symptoms were similar to my adult onset allergies to oysters in 2011. Sought remote care at 7:41, spoke to RN over phone who recommended a video visit, then after video visit was recommended to go to urgent care. Arrived at Urgent Care around 8:50 PM.   Had a steroid shot of solumedrol 125 mg to IM the left arm around 9 pm, then took some Benadryl and famotidine at urgent care. Picked up prescriptions for famotidine 7 days, prednisone 4 days, and Benadryl as needed.  Taking medications now with careful watching of potentially allergic reaction provoking foods such as shrimp, fish, nuts, and wheat.

I had a headache. A couple hours after vaccine I was told I was exposed to COVID. Got tested on 31st - I tested positive for COVID. Got shortness of breath, the bad muscle ache, the loss of smell and taste; coughing, sore throat, headache; fever. I still have headaches and I still have some congestion sometimes. It is getting better but my sense of smell and taste aren&#39;t back. Fever, shortness of breath, cough etc lasted 10 days. I was out of work for two weeks. Called the doctor  (January 4th, 2021)- for Oxygen levels - were dropping - they were in the high 80&#39;s - the doctor let me stay home and monitor on my own as I have a nebulizer and inhaler at home.

I asked her if she was short of breath and she denied. I asked her if she wanted  benadryl or epi and she declined but agreed to me calling 911. I  told patient that if she started to feel short of breath then I was going to give her epi. No medication was given to patient EMS arrived within 5 minutes and checked her out. They said she was not having an allergic reaction and asked if she wanted to go to ER but she declined. They advised that is she started to feel short of breath or tightness in the chest to immediately go to ER. The patient ended up leaving the store and was fine.

                                                Client received vaccine at 12:00pm after passing risk screening and completing consents at a vaccination clinic event at a local fire station. At 12:09pm, while client was sitting in the waiting area after vaccination as part of the recommended protocol to monitor for adverse events post-vaccination, she began feeling unwell. She started to walk toward the vaccination stations and was stumbling. Staff escorted her to a preassembled cot and had her lie down. The patient reported feeling &#34;tingling&#34; in her face, throat and lips and felt like her lips and tongue were swollen. There was no swelling visually apparent.

                                                I started to develop a reaction the first evening after receiving the vaccine. My arm was incredibly sore, I had neurological slip ups-i could not think thoughts fully all the way through and my tongue swelled overnight and I woke up to me frantically rubbing my tongue on my back teeth, which is extremely abnormal for myself.  the first night back started aching (I have never felt this pain before now), Developed swollen lymph nodes in my armpit and in my neck and chin on my right side of my body, was extremely lethargic.  and this continued for 3 days when the lymph nodes started to go down, and then an outbreak happened inside the right side of my throat, which is still in place today, seems to be healing now, but continued to get worse for 3 days before starting to heal. I am finally back to a normal level of energy and my mind seems to be working normally again, but my back is still in incredible pain.

These symptoms persisted, so I continued Benadryl every 4 hours for 2 days.  On Saturday 01/30/2021, when symptoms continued.  She advised switching from Benadryl to  a once daily dose of Claritin and Pepcid AC. Switched to Claritin and Pepcid, symptoms persisted but started to diminish in severity. Planned appointment with Primary Care Physician is scheduled for 02/19/2021.

Patient was given cold water to drink and I put a fan on her to help cool her off. Once her mouth became tingly, we agreed to call EMS to come check her out. Once EMS arrived, patient was feeling better. EMS checked her vitals and released her. We called her Aunt to come pick her up.

                                                Arm soreness and fatigue the first evening post-vaccine. Around approximately 2300, I had chills, hot flashes, and a low fever (101) along with tachycardia, which lasted several hours. My heart rate was up to 150bpm at its highest while at rest. I took 800mg ibuprofen which seemed to help.  The next day I was very fatigued and nauseated. I started to have some gum soreness as well. The next day (2/21) I felt much better, but my lips felt very chapped along with some gum pain. As the days went on, the inside of my lips against my gums and teeth felt very raw and painful, and my lips became extremely chapped, while the corners of my mouth were cracked and painful as well.  On or around 2/24, I began to have some very sore spots on my soft palate, inner lips, and inside of my cheeks. They mostly became small white sores, except for my lips, which became very red with tiny blood spots just under the skin.  As of today (2/27), I still have sore gums, small sores on the inside of my mouth, several under my tongue, and the red sore spots on the inside of my lips.  It isn&#39;t life-threatening, but it is very uncomfortable, and makes eating and drinking painful. I don&#39;t feel the need to go to an ED or urgent care at this time, but will try to make an appointment with a GP as soon as I can.

                                                The morning after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced a pressure in my left ear accompanied by both a constant low, muffled humming noise and a constant high-pitched noise. Neither have abated, though it&#39;s only been a little over 24 hours. The noises are very loud and it is hard to hear, as everything sounds muffled. It is distracting and constant.   I have no other illness, nor has anything changed in my daily routine in the past day.

                                                After receiving my first shot, I sat in the waiting room. My tongue started feeling somewhat funny, my whole body felt very warm, I had some pain in my abdomen on the left side (the side I had the shot), facial flushing, dizziness, headache. I was checked out by the medical staff at 11:25, they determined that I was probably safe to go home. On the way out, I developed itchy lips and hives on my upper lip. The dizziness lasted three days, and was accompanied by severe chills. I took Benadryl after a very nervous ride home. Everything up to the dizziness subsided.

Followed by immediate strong tingling sensation on right leg as walking toward chair. Was monitored for 40 minutes without any other symptoms.  Kept trying to walk it off with no improvement.. Left site due to not having ?life threatening symptoms? Numbing leg felt for 15 hours. By the next day 3/9/21, 5:30am tingling and numbing felt still on right leg, PLUS left leg,  left arm, and both hands.  Went to ER of same location before 7am. Not seen until nearly 10am. Ruled out stroke or allergic reactions. Bloodwork and urinalysis came back normal. ER doctor said to go home and wait another 24 hours. Come back if symptoms progressed or trouble breathing. By 12am 3/10/21, tingling felt on left and right part of the chest and under tongue. Went to  different ER. Dr suggested to report it but that it could be attributed to nerve damage, not necessarily Moderna caused. And must seek neurologist to further analyze.

                                                Patient experienced cramping immediately after administration and then &#34;tingly throat&#34; approximately 10 minutes after administration. I administered 50 mg diphenhydramine and continued to observe patient. Patient reported that tingling had stopped and she was feeling better prior to departure from observation area at 7:49 am. Counseled patient on potential for allergic reaction days to weeks after administration.

                                                I felt fine after the shot until about 7 pm when I started experience an intense, pressurized sensation in my head, jaw, chest, and arms. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ringing in my ears, and feeling flushed. Over night I felt some numbness in my hands and arms. The next day the feeling of  pressure and tightness was gone but the dizziness and nausea has remained. I have more energy but  am feeling concerned about the persistent vertigo.  I have a history of allergic reactions. I was also scheduled to begin my menstrual cycle this weekend and it has been delayed.

Woke up Jan 4th at 2:13am feeling the place of injection swollen, itchy and with a single hive like a bug bite, felt another on torso on the right side. Felt rapid pulse, got up to check the mirror, eyes swollen and itchy, tongue beginning to swell. Within minutes, started feeling itchy all over my body, specially mucosae, and scalp. Took 360mg of fexofenadine and 20mg famotidine, reaction started to subside. Was up monitoring until 3:45am. Still feeling itchy but significantly less at the before medication. Plan to continue with 180mg fexofenadine a day until all itchiness goes away.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

                                                On 1/15 around 6pm, I began to feel extremely fatigued (about 27 hours after my initial injection).  I began to feel severe flu-like symptoms (hot/cold chills, sensitive skin, headache, dry/scratchy throat, fever dreams) which persisted for several hours during the night. The next day (1/16), the fatigue, headache, and chills persisted (although the chills decreased). I took Dayquil before noon and that seemed to help with the symptoms, and Nyquil at night so I was able to sleep. By the following morning, I still had a mild headache and fatigue but continued to improve. I felt normal again on 1/18.   I also had stiffness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site for 3-4 days.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

Migraine headache - started about 20 hours after the vaccine. Took prescription imitrex, which usually solves the problem, and 3 hours later when I still had the migraine I took another imitrex. A couple hours after that it went away.   Eye pain/irritation - left eye - started more than a full week after the vaccine. Left eyeball hurt and also appeared slightly red and irritated. The pain was on and off for two days.

                                                About 8-10 minutes after the injection, my vision got blurry. It was very brief- only a couple minutes long. If it had lasted until the end of my 15 minute post-injection observation period, I would have reported it then, but it didn&#39;t. I decided to include it here, because later in the day, I had another reaction. About 12 hours after the dose -around 7PM- I started getting chills and body aches and abnormally fatigued. The chills were intense almost as soon as they come on. The body aches were mild for the first couple hours and progressed to intense. Both symptoms lasted continuously for about 12 hours, then around 7AM they started to wane. I&#39;m not sure if I should list insomnia as a reaction, but despite how exhausted I felt, I could not sleep. It could have also been just general discomfort that kept me from being able to sleep. Through most of the following day I had mild aches and waves of chills. By the time I went to bed that night (last night at the time of writing this), the symptoms had mostly  cleared and so far have not returned.

                                                The patient received the first dosage of the Moderna CoVid 19 vaccine today. The patient was informed that this will typically cause a sore arm and may cause symptoms of a upper respiratory type with some headache or achiness or even very minimal fever for the next 24 hours or so. Instructions were given to call me if symptoms become severe. Other instructions included taking Tylenol 325 mg 1 tablet 3 times per day as needed for aches and pains. It was reiterated that it is important to be sure to come back for the second dosage in 4 weeks and to continue to practice social distancing and wearing a mask and washing your hands frequently. Special mention was made to help the patient understand that maximal immunity to CoVid 19 infection does not occur until 2 weeks after the second dosage. Vaccine was administered in the deltoid of the left upper arm without incident. Waiting 30 minutes after the injection for evaluation and side effects was unremarkable except for the fact that the patient states that she had some slight blurriness in the left eye about 10-15 minutes after her injection but it went away after 1 or 2 minutes. She had no side effects from the injection at the time of her leaving.

                                                Several hours after vaccine administration, I began to get a headache. That headache intensified over the next 24-36 hours. A severe headache resulted with a painful, stiff neck, occasional fever, occasional diarrhea, confusion, vision changes, and increased imbalance. These symptoms lasted for about 1 week before I sought medical treatment at a virtual urgent care appointment on 1/5/21. They referred me to an in-person urgent care facility that day. At that facility, they said my symptoms were very concerning and said I needed to seek immediate medical assistance at the ED and offered to call me an ambulance. My husband drove me to the ED from the urgent care facility. At the ED, they treated me with a migraine work-up but eventually discharged me with instructions to follow-up as I was &#34;diagnostically unclear&#34; at discharge. After a week, my symptoms had not improved at all and so my previous ED physician suggested that I return to the ED (after being unable to get care in a timely manner in an outpatient setting). At the ED on 1/12/21, they again treated me with a migraine workup but also conducted a CT scan and a COVID test. When both tests came back negative, they conducted a lumbar puncture procedure. Those results came back positive for viral meningitis. As I had no other illness or known exposure to any other virus at that time - and given the timeframe of the vaccine administration - my care team concluded that this was a rare reaction to the COVID vaccine. I was discharged with instructions to follow up with my PCP and a neurologist. My follow-up neurology consult is scheduled for 2/19/21.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

On Saturday I felt better but started to get right ear pain. I went to urgent care on Monday and was diagnosed with an ear infection and was given antibiotics (Amoxicillin). The ear pain did not improve and I went to another doctor on Friday who confirmed that I had an ear infection and he prescribed me with Amoxicillin-CLAV. He said if my symptoms didn&#39;t improve to see a specialist. Yesterday (3/1/21) I started having vertigo and am having difficulty with balancing, especially if I turn my head too quickly. Since Saturday Feb. 20, I have been experiencing tinnitus, ear pain, jaw pain, a feeling of pressure/fullness in the ear, and can&#39;t hear properly. I am also experiencing jaw tightness and pain.

When it continued to get worse, I went to the dr about 3 weeks after my first shot and was diagnosed with labyrinthitis. My symptoms continued to worsen, and I now have severe hearing loss as well as 75% loss of vestibular function (diagnosed by ENT and audiologist) with constant vertigo. My current diagnosis is labyrinthitis, however I&#39;m also getting an MRI in 2 days to rule out other possibilities.

                                                I experienced an immediate metallic taste in my mouth. My pulse shot up to the 120s-130s and stayed elevated for about 12-24 hours. My body felt like it was in fight or flight for about 6-7 days. I had foul smelling diarrhea, weakness, fatigue and fevers. I have been experiencing random blood pressure spikes since being vaccinated and also cardiac issues. I saw two different allergists to get opinions on whether or not I should receive my 2nd dose. I also saw a cardiologist and had an echocardiogram done. My echo showed mild pulmonary hypertension which I have never had before.

Her eyes looked red without fever or chill. Otherwise, she did not have any other symptoms. The symptoms got worse on the two following days (Saturday and Sunday). She came to our pharmacy to report the adverse effects at 5:25 PM on Sunday (3/7/2021), and according to her report, Sunday was the worst. She took Tylenol for the past two days (Friday and Saturday) without improvement. We instructed her to take ibuprofen and to see her doctor on the day after (Monday 3/8/2021). We followed up with her on Monday, and she said her symptoms got improved with a tablet of ibuprofen.

I started to shake uncontrollably, have horrible body aches and chills, I went from hot to cold to hot again all through the night, i had a fever all night long, bad stomach cramps, super nausea all night long, and bad headache. This last all the way into the following night having me miss a whole day of work because I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. Since this second shot I have had severe heart palpitations, prolong period, blurred vision and severe body aches.

                                                Day of injection after I left the vaccination site I started to have a really bad headache and then sore arm (left arm where the injection was). Then about 7 hours after the injection I started to have a really bad stomach ache and cramps with nausea. This last all night long into the next day where it slowly went away. I was incredibly fatigued and the headache would not break. Then on the 3rd day Thursday January 7 I was feeling okay but not 100% myself. Then Friday January 08 I woke up and knew something was incredibly wrong because my stomach hurt way worse then before, i was so lethargic that I was falling asleep at my desk at work, I was shaking  uncontrollably, blurred vision, diarrhea with blood in stool and one close episode of fainting.  So at the point I ended up in the ER missing the rest of my work day. My symptoms didn&#39;t get better until the following Monday

                                                My heart started racing within a couple of minutes. I felt nauseous and my throat felt like it was closing. My mouth got dry. I had my son with me and didn?t want to scare him so I kept taking deep breaths and focusing on whether the side effect were getting worse. They didn?t. After another 5 minutes I could fee the pressure in my throat lessening and my heart rate slowed. It was terrifying but I?m thankful it didn?t progress. I didn?t seek assistance from the personnel on site. I was aware of what was going on but I?ve had anxiety attacks in the past and thought that was what it may have been until I read that an allergic reaction feels the same. If the second dose is stronger I don?t think it would be wise to attempt receiving that one.

                                                SORE ARM: March 5 at 7:00 pm - vaccination site on left arm started to feel sore. Lasted about 24 hours and then was gone. No treatment needed.   SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES: March 8 at 7:00 pm - felt a pop in right ear that felt like an earache accompanied by pain, which slowly traveled down under the jawline between ear and chin. Visibly swollen and painful lymph nodes under the jaw for the next 30 hours, then it went away.  Advil didn&#39;t help with the pain, no other treatment.   REACTION AT VACCINATION SITE:  March 12 - vaccination site on left arm itchy all day. Looked at it at 11:00 pm and it was about a 3&#34; itchy red circle around the vaccination site that was raised and hard, and emanating heat. Put aloe vera on it each morning and night.   Got about an inch larger over the next two days. Continued to emanate heat, less itchy.   March 14 at 11:00 pm - no longer a red circle, now the border was white but the center was normal. Was gone by the morning of March 15.

                                                33 year old female with no preexisting health conditions received her first Moderna vaccine on Saturday, March 13 at 9am in the left deltoid. Patient immediately felt weird after receiving the vaccine - tingling and accelerated heart but no intervention occurred. Patient started with the basic side effects headache, sore arm, shakes/chills and fatigue/weakness and brain fog.  Starting around 24-36 hours after injection patient started to notice mild muscle spasms and tingling sensations. That has progressed to full paresthesia of the arms/hands and legs/feet. Patient also states paresthesia occurs in the face, neck, lips, torso and even occasionally in ears - but these seem less severe and wax and wane. The patient noticed vision changes and muscle fatigue described as muscles feeling like &#34;jello.&#34; Due to weakness, patient also complains of continued brain fog. The patient is also occasionally getting twitching and pulsating muscles.   The patient describes the neuropathy &#34;like my limbs are defrosting.&#34; It was described as cold tingling but at times intense. Patient noticed that cold temperatures make it more pronounced and movement helps to temporarily make it seem a bit better.

                                                Patient received the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday (03/23/2021) at 10 AM on her left arm. She did not feel the injection. No immediate symptoms after the injection. Before 1 PM, she developed itching at injection site and started to scratch her arm. Noticed ~5 visible bumps around injection site. She started to feel hotness on the injection site. Patient noticed that she also had hives on her right arm and one hive on her abdomen. She was on her way to work. Went to the pharmacist and told them about her hives. Was recommended to take cetirizine. Took cetirizine, hives were relieved but notes she was still feeling itchy. Had itching on legs, stomach, arms, face throughout the day. Patient worked from 1:30 - 11:00 PM. Did not do a lot of heavy lifting. Was working in her office and around the store. After her shift, patient still had itching. She also noticed swelling on her cheeks, from her outer lips towards her cheeks. Took diphenhydramine and went to sleep. On Wednesday (03/24) morning, she had red lips and lip swelling, as well as facial swelling. Has never had dermal fillers. She was feeling very itchy, especially on her face. Took diphenhydramine, swelling improved. Patient was taking diphenhydramine every 6 hours. Took one diphenhydramine yesterday 3/25. Has not been taking cetirizine. When she is taking diphenhydramine, patient does not have itching. Patient still feels some itching if she does not take diphenhydramine. No lip tingling. Ongoing itching and hives. I instructed her to take Xyzal tablets (which do NOT contain polyethylene glycol) instead of Zyrtec or Benadryl tablets.   She is scheduled for allergy testing in 2 weeks, if her urticaria has resolved.

The reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% , 7 days after receiving the covid vaccine. I started to feel pain to left jaw but figured it was due to dental work. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek was very painful and hard. The pain to face was about 8/10. I iced it, took pain pill and fell asleep. When I woke up my left arm was hot itchy swollen and the arm and jaw were still very painful.    the reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% I started to feel pain to left jaw injection area. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek is painful and hard. By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. I&#39;m tearting it with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1%to deltoid  2-3 times a day.  By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s now 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. My left cheek jaw area is tender but I&#39;ll assume it&#39;s from the dental work. I&#39;m treating left arm  with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1% to deltoid  2-3 times a day. No changes at this time. It&#39;s starting to worry me because it feels like a hard mass that is painful and hot. (left deltoid).

She is having some tingling in her mouth and tingling in her feet. No obvious facial swelling or hives.   She denied rash, hives, welts, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, wheezing, throat tightness, hoarseness and stridor.   This provider was notified of patient reaction and she was then assessed in the emergency bay area.   Monitored patient for severe reaction symptoms, including but not limited to abdominal pain, blood pressure abnormality , chest pain, hypotension, increased swelling and rapid progression of symptoms.Treatment included: zyrtec 10 mg, pepcid 20 mg,  Follow up response to treatment: good. Patient discharge: Stable to go home and follow up with PCP.     Observed in the vaccine clinic for 1.5 hours I do not see a reason for ER assesment since she is improving.  Tingling in her mouth has improved.    This pt was encouraged to go home and rest She was encouraged to take a dose of benadryl at home. She may call me if worsening. Given precautions for her next vaccine. Discussed with pharmacist.

                                                on Wed 1/6/21 I had an allergic reaction and am unsure what set it off.  My eyes became itchy, watery and my corneas swelled.  I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

                                                I received my vaccination at approximately 7pm on Friday January 15th. Upon receiving my vaccinations I felt light headed, but after fifteen minutes I was okay to stand up and leave the facility. At around 12:05am  I began coughing and body aches and it continued throughout the night. By morning my cough had subsided, and I felt okay. By 11:30 am on 16th my body and skin began to tingle all over and I felt a burning sensation under my skin. My head began pound and a feeling of nausea came over me. I started feeling very warm about 10 minutes later and decided to take off my sweater and found that I had a large red rash across my chest. My temperature began to rise and my tongue and face began to swell and a feeling of shortness of breath came over me. By 4:00 my fever hit 104.2 and my body began to stiffen up  and my jaw began to clench involuntarily In small bursts for a total of what my family believes to have been 5-10 minutes. After taking 1000 mg of Tylenol my fever dropped to 103 for the next two hours and I began to shake uncontrollably, then it began to spike a again reaching 103.6. My spouse put cold towels on me and opened the windows to our bedroom to cool me down. Slowly my temperature started dropping and it finally reached 101 by 11pm. The next morning, Sunday, I woke with blisters on my mouth and severe body aches.

                                                Initially, I had severe arm and back pain that lasted 3-4 days.  On day 1-2, I was extremely exhausted, so exhausted that I actually wet the bed and I have NEVER wet the bed as an adult, which was extremely embarrassing.  The worst part is, since the shot, day 1, my eye has been twitching. I have been reporting it .  I do not think it is just a coincidence anymore like I originally thought.  I have had eye twitches in the past but they have never lasted this long!  It has been 3 weeks and there is no end in sight.  The time between twitches is sometimes less, but the severity of the twitching is getting more intense, sometimes causing my eye to blink (although usually its a lateral upper eyelid twitch) and I have had 1-2 instances of my upper lip twitching along with it (within the last couple of days).  The eye is driving me crazy.  I can&#39;t fall asleep at night because it keeps me awake and it twitches when I&#39;m trying to fall asleep.  There has been nothing that has changed in terms of increased stress, increased caffeine consumption, decreased sleep, etc. to have explained this persistent eye twitching.  I did have my annual eye exam on 1/15/2021 and talked to him about it and he said we will continue to watch it.  It was just annoying at first but it will not go away and like I said, the intensity and pulsating of the twitch is getting progressively worse.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I began feeling an increase in heart rate about 5-8 minutes after injection. I reported symptoms and site began to monitor my pulse, which was 160. I then drank 32oz of water and took 400mg ibuprofen. I then began to feel dizziness. Blood pressure was normal. My chair was reclined and I was given about 2oz of orange juice. I was then moved to a stretcher and my legs were elevated on a chair. I took a restroom break. I began by walking, but started to see spots in my vision and sat in a wheelchair. I was able to use the restroom and return to stretcher and elevation of my legs. I was then taken to the ER. I used the restroom once more independently. Blood sample was taken. Heart rate was  160, blood pressure was normal. EKG was abnormal and I was given dosage of adenosine. First dose did not show necessary improvement and I was given a second dose, which dropped my heart rate to the 90s. I used the restroom independently and was given an additional EKG, which was normal. During this time my Physician contacted a Cardiologist, for consultation. I was then discharged with recommendation to follow up with cardiologist in 2-4 days.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine Approximately 3.5 hours after receiving the vaccine, I developed hives on my right arm and the area around both eyes began to swell and itch.  At which point I took 25mg of Benadryl. The hives subsided after 2 hours of onset. Swelling around the eyes and itchiness persisted through the next day; although symptoms were not as severe as the night prior.  The morning of January 15th, I developed redness, swelling , and warmth at the injection site. Symptoms were not present prior to the morning of January 15th. The area of the injection felt hard underneath the skin. I was evaluated by a physician and treated for cellulitis with antibiotics. Symptoms resolved with antibiotic course.

This feeling subsided a little after 15 more minutes, so I went home.  At home (and within 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine), the lymph nodes in my throat swelled considerably and I had great difficulty speaking.  Having experienced anaphylaxis in the past, this was not anaphylaxis but something else entirely - it was like my vocal cords were paralyzed.  I took ibuprofen to help with the swelling, but it did not seem to impact my throat or ability to speak. About 4 hours later my throat muscles seemed to loosen and I was able to speak fairly normally again.

                                                After having a fever, chills, and aches, as those symptoms faded away, I began to perceive a distinct odor. It was intermittent and then was constant from Sunday morning until Friday morning. The odor was strong and differed at times. It varied from a minty smell, to a musty basement type of smell, to a chemical/bleach smell, to something unidentifiable but unpleasant. At times I also could taste it in the back of my throat. It was so strong that I gagged frequently on Tuesday and Wednesday at its peak. I could smell and taste normally, but in the absence of an external smell, I had this other odor in my nose. On Friday, the smell was noticeably less strong and intermittent. 13 days after vaccination, I still sometimes smell it although it is brief and mild. I am tested for COVID weekly, so I know it was not due to the virus.  1/21/21  Vaccine dose #1 1/22-23 Fever, chills, aches, fatigue, mild cough 1/23 Intermittent smell began 1/24-28 Constant perception of bad odor from wake to sleep 1/25 Tested negative for COVID via PCR test 1/29-Present Gradual decline of smell intensity and frequency

Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

                                                The day of the injection I had a very sore arm, just like my first dose. Then around quarter after midnight, I got up to use the bathroom. I recall extremely vivid dreams, and a little bit of disorientation. On my way back to bed I thought I?d take another ibuprofen to help me sleep because my arm was so sore. I remember feeling very dizzy, I did take my pill, and then I woke up on the floor. I was extremely disoriented and there was a shrill ringing in my left ear. As I came to, I recall really finding relief in the cold tile, and being concerned that I may have hit my head. I did a mental scan of my body and nothing felt painful, though stiff and sore, as I had the flu. I got back in bed and looked at the time, about 20 minutes had elapsed. The rest of the night I tossed turned, and felt quite feverish. I attempted to find radial and carotid pulses, which were extremely weak. That night, I  never did get a temperature, because I was quite disoriented. This morning I?ve been quite stiff and low energy. I feel discomfort in my kidneys, and have taken care to stay hydrated. I have reduced appetite, and some achiness in my body. My temperature right now is 100 even. It?s almost 3 o?clock, so about 28 hours has elapsed. I did not seek further medical care, as I live alone and transportation i would be a hurdle. I also not super concerned, mostly I just want you all to document that I painted, as I have not found that to be listed as a common side effect for the Moderna vaccine. I did call up a friend who is a paramedic, and feel reassured by her two cents.

                                                At approximately 15:00 on day of 2nd Moderna Vaccination Shot (given in LEFT UPPER ARM), I developed posterior mid-thoracic level back pain (atypical for me) which was extremely tender to palpation and &#39;dull, achy pain&#39; at around the T7-T9 region and mainly located within T7-T8 and T8-T9 intervertebral joint region.   At approximately 23:00, the evening of the 2nd Moderna Vaccine Shot (evening of 1/27/21), I developed a fever of 101.0 F. At around 01:00 AM on 1/28/21, my fever spiked to over 102.2 F and I was vigorously shaking with 3 layers of sweatpants, 3 layers of sweatshirts and 3 heavy blankets over me. I also developed RIGHT sided lower &#39;tooth/jaw&#39; discomfort, as if I had an abscess in my lower posterior teeth on the RIGHT side.   The fever broke to around 100.0 F at around 9 AM the morning after my 2nd Moderna Vaccine. But, again, at ~15:00 on day post-2nd shot (1/28/21), I developed a 101.0 F fever and was exhausted. By 9:00 AM on 1/29/21, I felt 100% better and remained asymptomatic.  I have never, in my life, experienced anything like what I experienced the night of and the early morning of the day after my 2nd Moderna vaccine. I have been sick before, hospitalized with high fever, and I have never felt the way I felt during the post-vaccine period. I also believe I was somewhat &#39;delusional&#39; as I remember waking up at around ~3:00 AM on 1/28/21 and I was screaming, for no reason what so ever, which was quite worrisome.

I grabbed an epinephrine injector and went to assist.  When I got close to pt she started to pass out.   911 was called and pt was administered a dose of epinephrine and she revived enough to speak coherently.  Shortly after emts arrived and took pt to hospital.

However, at the time, she did not say anything and went home after 30 minutes of observation. After the vaccine, her arm was first sore and a couple of days later, the soreness turned into an itching. The itch is local around injection site on left arm. Potential allergic reaction, lasting for days post injection.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

On Sunday 2/22/2021 she went to ER again due to feeling short of breath and dizzy spells. Symptoms made her miss one day of work next day because she still had mild symptoms and was very tired.

Squeezing sensation self-resolved after call. Paramedics arrived about 1 hr post-vaccination. BP 89/66. (Note my normal BP runs 90-110s/50s-70s.) HR 70s-90s. Pulse Ox high 90s. Paramedics not concerned that reaction was allergic, no rescue meds advised. I felt well enough to drive home despite persisting facial tingling and tight breathing. Allegra and albuterol taken upon arrival home, resolved breathing but not facial tingling. Facial tingling better but not resolved after about 24 hrs.

                                                When I received my first dose  and second dose of the Moderna  Covid vaccine I experienced the feeling of contrast solution going through my body. I had a weird taste in my mouth and a weird smell and a warm tingling sensation all over my body that started 30-60 seconds after the vaccine and lasted roughly 15 minutes. I also had slight swelling under my right side of my tongue. I notified the vaccine emergency employee and was told that is weird but that none of my symptoms had ever been reported and there was nothing they could do.

I woke up around 6 AM the following day and felt extremely fatigued. Around 6:30 AM I became nauseous and very lightheaded. I had to brace myself against a counter so I would not fall down and faint. I rested all day then around 1 PM I got up and fainted. I woke up a moment later and had an intense ringing in my ears for several minutes. I felt fatigued the rest of the day.

                                                On my way home from getting the vaccine I started having facial tingling, cheeks flushed, then facial numbness, weird taste in mouth that then turned to numbness especially in gums of front top teeth, and numbness in throat.  I can still breathe and eat and drink and control all of my facial muscles.  Feels like when the drugs they give you for numbing during dental work are wearing off.   Today (one day after first dose vaccination) I continue to have numbness, but it?s not worse, but I?m noticing that other parts of my skin including my forearms and scalp, left shoulder and neck are also feeling slightly numb and tingly.

                                                On 3/2/21 I administered the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine to patient about 9:20am.  On her PCQF she indicated that she had allergies to milk, shrimp, wheat, almonds and sesame.  She informed me she had no issues with medications or vaccines.  About 936am she came to me saying her throat felt itchy.  I gave her 25mg of diphenhydramine.  A few minutes later she told me she felt her tongue swelling and I gave her another 25mg of diphenhydramine.  At that point she told me her tongue felt very itchy and swollen and I called 911.  EMS arrived 14 minutes later and checked her out.  Her vitals were okay and she declined going to the hospital.  Patient sat for another 30 minutes or so and symptoms seemed to improve.  Patient has an EpiPen at home and patient bought a bottle of diphenhydramine to bring home with her.  I advised patient if any symptoms arise after the diphenhydramine wears off to take another dose.  If things seem to be worse she may need to use her EpiPen or call EMS.

                                                Have whooshing in my left ear.  It  will go away occasionally. Feels like it?s in time with my heart beat. It started on March 7th,  about 2 1/2 weeks after my first shot. As of today 3/18/21 I still have it.

She had low blood pressure, was pale, and had difficulty seeing clearly. EMS came to the scene to evaluate and her blood pressure recovered and she went home. She did not go to the emergency room, was just treated by EMS. She remained conscious and breathing and did not require CPR.

                                                Of course I had side effects like aches, bone pain (mainly spine and sternum), kidney pain, abdominal pain, sweating with no fever, etc. But none of that is an adverse effect.  The adverse effect happened when I was taking a shower 45 hours after my second vaccine. I was starting to feel better at this point. I started to feel like I was going to pass out. I quickly turned off my shower and sat down. I would have passed out had I not focused to not. I felt nauseous, lost my hearing and started to lose my sight. After I was ok, my lips were blue/Gray. I don&#39;t pass out. I&#39;ve passed out twice in my life when I was much younger. That&#39;s how I knew what was happening. I&#39;m scared this will happen again and I don&#39;t know what this means.

I woke up with neck pain, headache, tension and pain behind left ear. Pain got worse as the day passed. Following day the pain was unbearable and I went to the hospital. They provided medication for pain and antibiotics in case of infection. Medication was not working and pain progressively got worse. A day after going to the hospital the numbing in my mouth got worse and progressed to the entire left side of my head. By the evening , the left side of my face started dropping, at which time I went to the hospital again. The physician at the hospital advised I had Bell?s palsy and gave me pain medication, which did not work. The following day I saw my personal physician and he provided me with prescription medication for pain and relief of Bell?s palsy.

Pharmacist gave her Claritin 10mg  (5-7 min post vaccination). She has experienced seizures in the past and felt like one was coming on. She had nausea, light headedness, cooling sensations. She was given some water and then asked for pepto bismol, which we gave her (10-15 min) post vaccination. She then started getting hives on neck and eye. She wanted an ambulance called, we did. She started getting tingles on both arms and neck. Felt a sensation like someone sprayed water near her on her neck. Ambulance arrived and by that time she was feeling better and hives were leaving.  Paramedics checked her out and she declined going to hospital. Headache started when paramedics were assessing her. She had a friend come pick her up and take her home, to monitor her.

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

I suffer from chronic migraines but this way way more intense than my normal ones. the pain was all over my head, I had vision changes being very blurry and cloudy. the pain shot all the way down my neck. i had to go to urgent care expecting to get a toradol shot and go home. instead was sent via ambulance to the ER in fear i may have had a bleed. i ended up in the ER on saturday 4/24/21. they never gave me a CAT scan i was sent over there for. instead made me sit there for 2 hours in room before being seen. then came in said here&#39;s some meds and made me wait another 2 hours. i was discharged faster than it took them to take my copay for the visit! so for having a blinding headache for 2 days they didnt take it very seriously. on top of the headache i had sever muscle and joint pain to the point i couldnt move. i couldnt keep food down either.

                                                Within five minutes of my vaccination  I started to feel very dizzy and my eyesight became blurry. I told my husband who had also been vaccinated that I thought something was wrong and within a seconds I then passed out and he caught me. I vomited twice in the span of the next ten minutes and I was not alert for any of that time-no recollection of being able to see or hear. My husband stated my eyes were open and pupils very  dilated. He was able to get me to the ground with the help of the pharmacist who had administered the vaccine. 911 was called and by the time they arrived I became coherent enough to talk and interact. I declined a hospital visit because I had no interest in a ambulance ride but did follow up with my primary. No history of ever fainting or medical anxiety.

                                                The next morning following the vaccination, my right lower eyelid started severely twitching every 10-15 minutes for 4 days throughout the entire day, usually subsiding at bedtime. Each time it lasts from 30 seconds to 1 minute every single day. on the 5th day, the twitching stopped for approximately 15 hours but returned when I went to sleep and kept me up through the night. THis has really taken a toll on my livelihood and I am afraid of it progressing to Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never had this happen.

It was swollen for a few hours until I remembered to take allergy medicine.  It subsided. Then today, January 19, 2021, it happened again.  It didn&#39;t swell as much, but was extremely itchy. My neck area and stomach area is itchy as well.

They monitored me for another 30 minutes. They said I got super pale. They tried to give me ginger ale and crackers, but my stomach wouldn&#39;t allow it. They monitored me for a while longer and I felt better. I went home and woke up the next morning feeling terrible. Vomiting, swelling, muscle aches. I was in bed the whole time and I missed 4 days of work. I went back Tues 19th.

I couldn&#39;t swallow, couldn&#39;t feel my lips. I went back to where I received the vaccine and was given Benadryl. I waited 30 min and my throat closed again. I was given more Benadryl and I had to wait again. I eventually went home and slept the rest of the day. I woke up feeling like  I was hit by a bus. I was sweating with chills for two days.  I slowly got better. The muscle ache took longer to go away and I was eventually able to return to work on Monday. I was having problems with my throat. The allergy specialist had me doing breathing exercises and it eventually got better.

I took 800 mg Ibuprofen and then I had to take 1000 mg Tylenol and was sent home from work and Tylenol kicked in and I dosed every 8 hours and did that for a few days to be safe. The 31st wasn&#39;t bad - mostly felt fatigued and was getting on and off headaches. 1st - Feeling some fatigue still is all and then SI joint has still not resolved.

She was alert and oriented but appeared to be weak and mildly uncomfortable.  She was observed for almost 30 minutes with resolution of the nausea but remained weak, dizzy and then started to c/o of facial numbness &#34;like I got novocaine.&#34;  She stated it was her whole face including lips and tongue.  She remained alert talking in full sentences.  &#43;facial symmetry, no obvious facial or tongue swelling.  Vitals remained stable.  At that time it was decided to transport her to the ED for continued evaluation.  She was brought from the outpatient vaccine clinic to the ED via wheelchair without incident.

After throwing up, she said her mouth numbness was better, but now her fingers were numb and she felt like she couldn&#39;t bend them. Because she threw up, she was not given PO Benadryl. Onsite EMT called for ambulance so she could go to hospital and get IM Bendryl. Airway was fine the whole time and therefore EpiPen not administered.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

Within the first minute I could also taste the vaccine (kind of like how when saline is flushed in an IV it can be tasted) and that lasted a few hours. Ten mins after taking the vaccine I took a Zyrtec and ten minutes later the rash got better and I started feeling better. The nose and throat got better abt 1.5 hrs after reaction. I felt extremely tired and beat up until the next day In the following days I was better. I still had drainage from my nose and my throat was bothering (itchy) , but not like the first day.

                                                I began having mild, localized left axilla pain and anterior shoulder joint pain at 24 hours post injection.   Over the next 24 hours (ie 48 hours post injection) the symptoms progressed to severe sharp, stabbing pain radiating to the left lateral neck along the jaw line, left anterior shoulder, left chest wall and along the left ribcage approximately T2/3 down to T9/10.  Also experienced gnawing-type stomach pain with some nausea at this time.  At the height of symptoms (approx 36 hours post injection), pain level was 9/10 and described as knifelike, sharp, and stabbing.  It was exacerbated by movement, particularly cough, sneeze, and hiccup.  Relieving factors included heat to the ice, but mild relief.  Pain levels began to diminish between hours 48 and 72 post-injection. By 72 hours post injection the jaw and left neck pain had resolved.  The left anterior shoulder/axilla and chest wall pain persisted, but severity had reduced from 9/10 to 4-5/10.  At 96 hours post injection severity had diminished to 2/10 with pain only at the left chest wall approximately T4/5 down to T9/10.  I am now 3.5 days out from injection and have pain level of 1/10 to the left chest wall with hiccup, sneeze, cough, and deep breath.

I felt like I was going to pass out &amp; I felt very dizzy. I went to the Hospital the same day and they said that everything looked red inside my mouth and to follow up with my primary the next day. They gave me an IV. The dizziness continued for a few days &amp; then I got very shaky the next day it lasted for a week but the swelling came down the next day.

On my drive home, between 2100-2110 started feeling tingly and numb around mouth and it spread to entire face. Tongue and inside of cheeks also felt tingly/numb.  No visual swelling of face and breathing was ok. I didn&#39;t feel any airway obstruction.  Heart rate also increased. I continued driving to the nearest store to get Benadryl (about an additional 20-25 minutes).  Took 50mg at approximately 2145 and my symptoms slowly got better. As of today (02/16/2021) my face does not still feel 100% back to normal, very minimal numbness/tingly but more so on the left side which was also the same side as injection. I have had no facial drooping.

She had a tingling inside her mouth behind her teeth.  She was administered Benadryl.  She then got a tingling inside of the throat that moved down into her chest.  First Response team  was called.  She was having SOB.  She was moved to the ER where she was given more Benadryl and prednisone.  After that she had tingling in her lips as they were warm and puffy.  She was released around noon.  About 1:00 PM the same day pt started having SOB and the same bad taste in her mouth along with all of the other symptoms.  She took another Benadryl at 1:54 PM.   At 3PM she was sleeping and woke with tingling and hotness in her lips.  She started coughing and having trouble catching her breath.  This symptoms went away and came back at 3:46 pm.  She then again developed the same symptoms all over again but this also included swelling in the back of the tongue.   She took another Benadryl at 6:28 PM and then again at 10:28. About 11PM she got these mouth symptoms again along w/ really itchy feet and back.  She woke up at 5:50 AM she felt fine. At 8:00 AM she woke up and had the strange metal taste in her mouth along with a strange feeling in it.   At 11AM she had mild episode of the SOB and coughing.  At 3:15 she still has this taste in her mouth along with the strange feeling.  Pt is waiting on a CB from her PCP.

Occipital headaches began that evening, then the next day fever, body aches, and head pain worsened.  Blurred vision has been steadily worse since the day after the injection, and breathing is aggravated, requiring more gasping for air.  Extreme fatigue has been present since the evening of the injection.  GI symptoms including nausea, lack of appetite, and diarrhea, and gurgling upset&#39; stomach have been present since the day after the injection.  Severe trembling of the hands was observed on video, and body tremors were present in office.  Patient reports feeling unwell&#39;, exhausted, nauseous, and in pain. It won&#39;t let me continue.

                                                I did initially feel a little light headed while waiting the 15 minutes post vaccine, but thought I was anxious. As I was driving home at 3:50 pm I suddenly started to feel tingling in my lips and my throat felt swollen and my chest tight. I was halfway home and panicked so I went home and stayed put. My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

Pt was planning on waiting 30 minutes d/t prior reactions to medications. Writer assessed pt and pt was talking to writer without any struggling or difficulty. Writer asked pt if this feeling was r/t anxiety or if this feeling was r/t the vaccine administration. Pt stated that for sure anxiety. Pt also mentioned then that tongue felt scratchy and throat felt scratchy.  Pt has benadryl  and epi-pen in purse at all times d/t history of anaphylaxis. Pt did not appear to be concerned at all about scratchiness and asked if a bendadryl could be administered. Writer administered 25 mg diphenhydramine with positive effect beginning. Pt felt as if she were able to leave without issue. Pt denied the need for ambulance transfer or visit to the ER by another form of transportation (friend, family). Pt has a Dr. appt next week and will discuss the second dose at that time. Pt ended up leaving  following 50 minutes after vaccine was administered.

GI issues persisted for the next 3 weeks and on Thursday evening, 2/25/2021 at about 6:30 pm. I was sitting on floor with children and almost passed out. I felt very faint, dizzy, and instantly started chilling. I had a fever of 102.8 and could not get warm. My husband was going to call paramedics, but I encouraged him not to. Discovered my right breast was red and inflamed/ swollen as well as all of my lymph nodes in my right arm pit. I could not reach my right arm forward. I noticed around 12:06 AM after not being able to get warm or break fever. I messaged my primary care clinic when I noticed the breast swelling, redness, pain, and lymph node swelling. I continually felt like I was going to faint/pass out and was very dizzy all night long. I was also extremely fatigued. The did a telemedicine appointment the next morning and diagnosed me with mastitis and prescribed me antibiotics. I am a breastfeeding mother and all of these symptoms came on suddenly and severely on the same side that I got the vaccine shot. I have been breastfeeding for over 7 months and my supply has been dwindling to nothing so I have no problems with engorgement or blocked milk ducts. Before this baby I had just got done breastfeeding a baby for 11 months with no issues of the like.

Arm still sore and swollen. Feels like a mild common cold. 48 - 60 hours everything seems to have cleared up. Still slightly swollen lymph and tenderness/ swelling/ lump at injection site.

Fever always maintained predominantly above 102, dropped to 101 before it broke and went down.

                                                Patient called pharmacy via telephone to discuss that she thought she was having an allergic reaction to the moderna vaccine that she received on thursday (2 days ago). She described that it started as tingling roughly 10-20 minutes after the vaccine resulting in swelling around her lips characterized by an odd tingling, dry, itchy area with tiny hard to see bumps - I discussed with patient the possibility of cold sore - pt states they have had cold sores before but it has never felt like this before - she stated this started after receiving the moderna vaccine on thursday - I advised follow up w MD to evaluate need for exam / diagnosis of possible allergy to vaccine vs symptoms being unrelated to the vaccine, and to do this sooner rather than later and definitely before she receives the next dose of moderna vaccine just to be sure. I advised discussing with the MD the need for epi-pen prescription or discuss risk vs benefit of getting the second vaccine, before she gets the next dose of vaccine, due to facial swelling and possible allergy - advised if facial swelling continued to get worse or began to compromise breathing to seek medical care, although it seems unlikely this would occur due to the shot being administered days ago and symptoms do not appear to be progressing. I advised using an antihistamine (claritin or zyrtec during the day and benadryl at night) to see if this helps with swelling/reaction - advised that if this helps that it may indicate higher likelihood of this being an allergic reaction to the shot and to report this to the MD as well. patient confirmed that she will be following up with MD to discuss.

Causing me to writhe in pain.  Tense right sided neck and jaw pain. Severe occipital headache (felt like hit with a baseball bat). Trembling. No fever. Symptoms improved around hour 12 post vaccine. For 7 days following the vaccine, intermittent severe headache (again occipital, baseball bat feeling), whole body weakness, sense that legs would give out when walking (I am physically active and fit so this was very far from my baseline), muscles would burn and fatigue after short period of usage, sensation that legs from the knees down were sitting in ice water (felt cold, slightly numb, very weak). Symptoms were present for 7 days and would wax and wane in intensity.

I also have a headache behind my eyes and am very tired, and my arms are itchy.

I went to my gynecologist , first thinking I may have a yeast infection but she did not see a rash and couldn&#39;t diagnose me. She told me that my pain was probably neurological. She took my blood and sent it to a lab for possible yeast infection and STDs. She prescribed me Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Diporopionate 1%. I went to my PCP on Wednesday because the burning intensified and I thought that I may have shingles. I have a stuffy nose and my sense of smell isn&#39;t very good right now. My PCP gave me a Covid test and told me that she can not test me for shingles because I do not have a rash. She did prescribed me Gabapentin 100mg . I am awaiting Covid test and Lab results

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after injection I started driving home. I began to feel like my mind was foggy and some fatigue, then my lower lip and tongue started to tingle. I stopped driving and waited to see if anything further developed. I then felt flush and my hands became clammy. After maybe 2 minutes these symptoms resolved, I never had any trouble breathing so I continued home and did not seek any medical attention. The whole time frame was about 5 to 10 minutes.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

It lasted for about 30 minutes. The symptoms subsided while sitting back in a chair and drinking 2.5 bottles of water. I was able to walk out and proceed with grocery shopping slowly. Have taken it easy the rest of the day but able to be upright. Now just fatigue, muscle aches, feeling cold, abnormal teeth and tongue sensation x 2 hrs). The rest of the symptoms just described continue this evening which i attribute to the covid vaccine.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the shot, I felt a warm tingling sensation in my throat. I alerted the nurse and about another 3-5 minutes afterwards felt like a rising sensation up toward my ears. It almost felt like I was being filled with something but could still breathe. I start to have a fast heartbeat and felt like I was sweating. I received Benadryl (IM) and felt relief about 1-2 minutes. After about 7-10 minutes I felt like it was coming back and the feeling rising back to my ears. I received another dose of Benadryl. I went home and made sure I continued the Benadryl  for 24 hours. My throat appeared swollen from the outside of my neck when I woke up from a nap about 3-4 hours after receiving the vaccine shot. My chest did have a little redness like hives but not full blown. Just red and irritated. The next morning my voice was very hoarse for a day and a half.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                MODERATE PAIN (6/10) AT INJECTION SITE began within 30 minutes of vaccine administration. Ibuprofen provided no pain relief, taken once 4 hours post-vaccine administration, and again 8 hours after. 24 hours after initial injection given, at work (I am a medical student rotating in neurology at the clinical site where the vaccine was administered), I felt severe pain at injection site (10/10), radiating toward my left shoulder blade. The pain was so severe, I could not continue my work. I applied an ice pack to my arm and took Ibuprofen, sat on the floor in the dark to wait for relief. I felt my heart racing, hyperventilating (likely due to pain), became diaphoretic, and experienced photophobia as well as tremulous shaking. After approximately 30 minutes, a supervisor found me and alerted emergency med techs on staff, who measured vitals and rushed me to the Emergency Department of our hospital. The pain began to subside to 5/10 after an hour in the ED, where I was treated with intravenous fluid (NS), diphenhydramine PO, and metoclopramide PO. I was stabilized, pain under control (3/10), and released approximately 3 hours after admission, at 3:15 PM.

                                                I had no immediate symptoms other than slight redness and muscular pain at injection site for a couple days, which was tolerable. 8 days after my vaccine (1/14/21) I noticed tightness in my right cheek and my tongue feeling a little numb or burnt in the evening while relaxing watching tv.  The next morning (1/15/21) when I woke up, the right side of my face was drooping.  It was mild at the time, but I was worried I was having a stroke, called my doctor and she felt comfortable having me come for an office appointment.  At my appointment, she diagnosed me with Bell&#39;s palsy and did 3 blood tests and had me get a head CT.  Results for all were unremarkable. I am 14 days out from when symptoms started and still dealing with Bell&#39;s palsy.  I did start a round of oral steroids on 1/19/21 and will finish those in the next 3 days.  I did not start any antivirals or any other treatments.

                                                Morning of vaccine took 10 mg of Zyrtec and 20 mg Pepcid. At 2:45 pm took 20 mg Zyrtec and 20 mg of Pepcid. This was per my allergist recommendation.  Vaccine received at 4:15 pm . 45 minutes after receiving vaccine my tongue began to tingle. It then began to swell. Within next 20 minutes I had facial swelling and redness on my checks. I had no problems breathing or swallowing. Took 50 mg of Benadryl. Did not improve and took 20 mg of prednisone. Swelling stopped increasing. Anything I put in my mouth the taste was intensified. Pop tasted flat. Took 10 mg Zyrtec and 20 mg Pepcid.  By 11 pm the redness was gone in face. Swelling was going down in face. Tongue was still swollen. At midnight took 25 mg of Benadryl. At 6:45 am when I woke I had no more swelling but my tongue is still tingling. All day my tongue hurt and as of 7:20 pm it still hurts at the tip. During the day I had a headache. Arm pain.  Spoke with allergist and advised to continue the increase dose of Zyrtec Thursday.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

The next day I was standing at my standing desk and started to feel light headed, and sat down and became ore light headed. My vison started to gray out,  my arms were tingling and my ears were ringing.  That lasted for a few minutes, it slowly got worse to the point where I thought I was going to faint, then slowly got better.  I spoke to my midwife about this, I was unsure if it was the vaccine or the pregnancy.  I&#39;ve never had this happen before. My midwife thought it was a Blood drop from eating then standing up right away.

Swelling caused moderate pain and mild difficulty swallowing with mild breathing obstruction/discomfort. Onset of symptoms was roughly 10-12 hours post Moderna injection #1. Symptoms abated somewhat with Benadryl and NSAIDs. Raspy voice, pain in neck/chin jaw from swelling, visible swelling of lymph nodes and discomfort (somewhat positional) when breathing, swallowing, speaking. Night #1 was severe. I may have gone to the ER if I was not so immunocompromised. Day 2 was uncomfortable/painful but better with NSAID use. Night 2 had increased swelling and pain that improved after taking Benadryl and Singulair and nightly dose of Celebrex. Day 3, I am a bit uncomfortable with mild pain and visible swelling, but improved from Day 2.

Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

The following day hives increased to chest, armpits and abdomen - went to be evaluated., was having allergic reaction.  Was given Solumedrol IM injection and Rx for prednisone dose pack and Claritin, also told to take Benadryl.   The following evening hives  increased to chest, abdomen, back, arms neck and hairline.  Called in to work the next day and instructed to continue Rx treatment of prednisone, Claritin and to take Benadryl every 6 hours and advised to not get second injection.  Took mediations as prescribed at home but hives continued to spread with some mild swelling to eyes, face and lips.  By Sunday hives had improved to my chest, and and legs but started moving to my feet. Monday hives had improved by  about 50 percent, did call in to work and continue take Rx?s with Benadryl every 6 hours.  On Tuesday, most all hives had disappeared, except to lower legs and feet. Hives completely gone on Thursday.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the 2nd shot of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine around 9:25 am on 2/5/2021, after about 10 minutes I became hot and lightheaded.  Immediately after that I started getting tingling and numbness bilaterally in my hands and fingers with a heavy sensation.  My heart also started racing.  The nurses put me in a wheelchair and escorted me upstairs to the ER.  In transit my face and throat/neck started getting tingling as well.  By the time we reached the ER waiting room (9:42 am) I got the shakes/chills and was very cold.  I continued having the shakes for several minutes.  By the time I was brought back into the triage area (9:50 am) my legs from the shin to feet bilaterally started going numb/tingly as well.  I started having a cyclical reaction.  I would shake/have the chills for about 5 minutes (without any tingling/numbness in extremities), after that I would get a full body flushing sensation with feeling of lightheadedness and nausea, followed by numbness/tingling in both hands and feet. Then the cycle would repeat itself for several hours.  I continued to have a heavy sensation of my hands and feet until about 10:15 am.  After that the heaviness sensation did not accompany the tingling/numbness that persisted.  I was hooked up to IV fluids and IV benadryl at 10:45 am.  By 12:30 I finally stopped getting the chills/shaking sensation but I had a consistent body flushing followed by tingling/numbness in my hands and feet (mostly hands/arms) about every 5 minutes.  Around 1 pm I all symptoms had stopped.  The doctor said all my tests and blood work looked good.   I was discharged from the hospital around 2:45 pm with instrustions to followup with primary doc or return to the ER if symptoms got worse.   At 5:30 pm that evening all my symptoms came back, started with chills and then full body flushing sensation followed by tingling/numbness in both arms/hands bilaterally. I also had a hot sensation up the entire side of my left arm (injection site arm) up to my ear.     I took 2 500 mg tablets of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl at 6:20.  By 6:40 I was starting to feel a little better with less shaking and less body flushing/tingling.  Symptoms seemed gone by 7 pm.  I went to bed at 9 pm and woke up around 10:30 pm to my body flushing and my hands going tingling/numb.  I tried to sleep, but could not.  Around 11:30 pm I took 1 500 mg tablet of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl.  I woke up the next morning (2/6/2021) with no numbness/tingling shaking or body flushing.  I felt extremely exhausted and sore.  That day my symptoms did not return.   I woke up on Sunday 2/7/2021 with no symptoms, but around 8:30 am I had a lightheaded episode and hot sensation with a feeling of nausea.  I then started to get tingling in my face, mouth and lips.  It persisted for 2.5 hours until I decided to take Benadryl (2 25 mg tablets).  about 30 minutes after taking medication the tingling stopped.  It did not return.

I feel like I have gone through a significant altitude change and there has been no way to &#34;pop&#34; my ears, through yawning, blowing out with nose plugged/mouth closed etc.  It&#39;s disorienting,  I had the typical fever/chills/general sick feeling for 2 days following vaccine. Not a huge deal in the scope of things but I figured I might as well report it.

                                                After she received the vaccine she started to feel itchy and had redness at injection site.   She remained itchy for several days, but it would come and go.  About two weeks after the shot; she started to break out into hives on her arms, then spread to her legs, back and head.  Her palms got red.   She took claritin and it gave her short-lived relief.  She got prescribed a medrol dose pack, she completed two packs and still no relief.  It helped while she was on it then symptoms came back once she stopped.  She has an itchy throat, swollen face.  She also has diarrhea.  Symptoms have no been for over a month and seem to be getting worse.  Following up with an allergist and her PCP today.   Dr. then prescribed Solu Medrol, IV which she had last week. While, she was receiving the treatment, she felt better.   As soon as the IV was done. She started to break out again.  Today she came into work, and her eyes were blood shot. She also has pressure in her chest and has a hard time swallowing.  She had hives on the inside of the mouth, and alongside her tongue.    She will be seeing an allergist and an infectious disease in the upcoming days.

Approximately 2- 2 1/2 hours after the injection the right side of my face started tingling, not completely numb but mild numbness.  The feeling is similar to Novacane wearing off from dental work.  Around 8 p.m. while laying down, my lips tingled for awhile.  As on 10 a.m. on 2/12/2021 I still have mild tingling in my right side of face and upper lip area on the right side.  I have had mild chills.

                                                Currently pregnant - 36 weeks, 4 days day of the vaccine. Due date is 3/11/2021 but will be induced on 3/4/2021 because I am 36, no other underlying health conditions. Allergic to Cipro and Sulfa medications. Currently taking prenatal and 50 mg of Zoloft. Waited the 15 mins and felt fine; driving home about 30-40 minus after vaccine, swallowing felt difficult and tongue began to swell slightly. I went to my primary care; they said my throat looked clear but tongue was slightly swollen. I was given Tylenol extra strength (2 pills) and 25 mg injection of Benadryl in the left arm.  Encouraged to still get the second dose and take Benadryl prior the vaccine as well as go to the primary office to be observed after the shot.

We advised patient that we would want to observe her for 30 minutes after her second dose as a precaution. Second dose  was administered at 11 AM and at 11:07 AM patient reported tingling in lips and tongue, which was going numb. Administered 50 mg Diphenhydramine at 11:07 and advised patient that we would like to watch her for a full 30 minutes after diphenhydramine administration. At 11:32 patient stated that she was feeling much better and that the numbness had subsided and the tingling was lessening. Patient decided to leave the room, however was nearby in the facility as she was working and stated if she started to feel anything abnormal that she would return to staff for treatment/supervision.

                                                10 days and I still feel like shit after this vaccine... last night was scary. Back left under ribs back pain...then chest pain left / same spot on the front left... felt like a cardiac event. Then I saw the large inflamed rash on my left arm and I collapsed in the shower. I took my medicine and went to sleep and felt ok for a little this morning and now the pain is back - this time with heartburn. I?ve been sick to my stomach on and off since the vaccine, weird taste and feeling in the back of my throat, place where they gave me the shot swelled up half the size of a baseball within an hour of the vax - it?s still a bit bigger than my other side. Could it be allergic reaction to this?

                                                After the first dose on 2-23, I experienced a tickle in my throat within minutes. It was difficult to swallow but I did not have trouble breathing. My tongue and throat felt swollen. The nurse suggested I stay longer. I drank a bottle of water, which helped. I stayed 45 minutes until the symptoms seemed to start to go away. The nurse directed me to take Benadryl before the second shot. I took Benadryl and still experienced the symptoms above, but to a lesser extent. I looked at my throat and tongue in the mirror and saw what looks like a rash/pustules on the back of my throat and top of my tongue way in the back of my mouth. The symptoms are slowing going away (I received the second dose 7.5 hours ago), but I thought reporting them may help in some way. Thank you for making this vaccine available and thank you for all you?re doing to help keep others safe.

                                                I received my shot at 3:45 p.m.  A few hours after receiving my 1st Moderna shot in my right arm, it began throbbing (perhaps around 7 p.m.) At night, the throbbing in my arm was so severe that it woke me up several times (11 p.m., 2 a.m., and 4 a.m., at least) I awoke at 6:20 a.m. and began working; I immediately noticed that I was hot and had a mild fever and my lower back was hurting; arm was still throbbing. Within about 30 minutes of working on my computer, I began feeling nausea, the sweats/chills were more prevalent, and my arm still hurt.  I went and laid down in bed and fell asleep around 7:15 a.m. I woke up at 10 a.m. I still had a mild fever with sweats/chills, a headache, body aches (back and neck), and my arm was still sore Around 10:30 a.m. I took 3 Advil and ate, and felt a little better. As of 12:45 p.m. I just went on a sneezing binge and have a runny nose, my neck is still aching, arm is still throbbing, I still have a headache and my eyes feel heavy, and I still am getting chills/sweats.  I do not feel great.

Symptoms did not improve and seemed to be getting worse so she called 911 and was transported to Medical Center for treatment.  Reproted getting more benadryl and epinephrine in her IV followed by a steroid.

Eight days after the Vaccine I had numbness in my lips and muscle weakness on the right side of my face. My eyebrow, eyelids and my lips were falling down. I could not wear my contact lens because of this. I was prescribed Steroids and Antiinfection. I visited the doctor. I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. I was treated for seven days with slow improvement in my symptoms. The Bells Palsy got suddenly better within three weeks.   I still got the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                I waited a full 30 min after my injection due to my peanut allergy.  Left hospital feeling ok- on drive home began to feel flushed in my face, tingling in my lips and began to wheeze.  It felt like my peanut allergy but on a smaller scale.  I took my Albuterol inhaler and some Benadryl once I got home and felt better.  The next day I still have some itchiness and  fullness in my throat but nothing like yesterday.

                                                first I only had pain in my arm where it was given, throughout the day the pain increased and it became hard to move my arm much, there was some swelling at the site. Later that night I started to have a headache and the next morning I felt so tired and groggy it was hard to get up. I continued to feel exhausted and have difficulty focusing due to the headache and tiredness the entire day. I woke up feeling better the next morning.

Also noticed slight numbness of fingertips to right hand. Patient attributed this to her mask being on too tight and receiving the vaccine in right arm and was discharged from clinic without stating the above. As patient began to drive 50 minutes to home, she called her husband and stated she felt numb inside her right gum and cheek- he advised her to return to clinic.

                                                Patient is an employee at Health Center. She was given the vaccine approx 3:30 pm on 1/28/2021 in the left deltoid. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine without incident. The following is a written statement from patient describing events: &#34;About 30 minutes after vaccine, I felt like I had hit my elbow on something. Discomfort radiated from left elbow to wrist- I did have pain around injection site. About 8:30pm on 1/8/21, area around injection site became more painful. Gradually pain increased radiating down to finger tips and up to left side of neck, stopped right below ear. Neck and shoulder muscles felt really tight- uncomfortable ache. Also got extremely tired- left side of face felt numb- left eye slightly blurry- I fell asleep about 10pm. Woke up a few hours later drenched in sweat. Face numbness gone, eyesight normal.? Patient reports the following day 1/9/2021 @ 2pm: ?All of a sudden I started to sweat all over. I didn?t feel hot, only last about 30 minutes.? Patient reports on Sunday 1/10/2021: ?Woke up feeling okay. Left arm and neck still ached but not as bad. Got fatigued around 10am. I got a headache that became really bad. Dizzy, nauseous- no relief from OTC meds. Headache went away after a few hours.? Patient reports today 1/11/2021: ?Today I am still very tired. My left arm, fingertips, shoulders and neck still ache. Face is flushed.? Patient does state previous reactions to prior vaccines: ?TdaP about 7 years ago made me have joint pain for months. Last flu shot received was about 9 years ago, had flu like symptoms x12 hours.? Patient did not seek any medical care for the reaction described above. Patient?s PCP has been also been made aware of her reaction.

All symptoms resolved in about 15 minutes with the exception of  numbness/tingling to tongue and lips which lasted 3 hours. Symptoms resolved on their own without treatment/medication other than lying flat with feet up and drinking a bottle of water. I was assessed by medical professionals at the vaccine clinic which was located inside of the hospital. I consulted with an ED physician but did not require any additional treatment.

I read about people with lip fillers having a similar reaction with the moderna vaccine, however I have no lip fillers. I took Benadryl and the swelling improved, however it is not completely better.

The back of my tongue became very dry.   I felt better after 10 minutes and never passed out.  They took my vital signs and everything was normal.  I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

Day 3---no side effects Day 4 to Day 5---At about 8 pm, I noticed slight swelling underneath my left eye, that looked like a bag.  My face was also red.  The sides of my face, jaw line,  &amp; both sides of my neck were itchy.  I went to bed since I was supposed to work the next morning at 6 AM (OB Nurse).  I work up at 4:15 AM &amp; my face was quite swollen, specifically my left side, my face &amp; neck was warm to the touch &amp;  itchy.  I immediately took 50mg of Benadryl &amp; called my internal medicine doctor. Day 5---I was to be seen in the clinic at 7:00 AM.  The Benadryl helped some.  I was not having any breathing difficulty.  I was prescribed 5 days of Prednisone.  By about 1:00 PM,  the swelling was worsening &amp; my lips were tingling.  I called the doctor again &amp; they told me to go to the ER.  I never had issues with my airway.   The swelling was always worse on my left side of my face.  I received IV fluids &amp; Solumedrol &amp; was discharged with an epi pen, &amp; told to continue the Benadryl, Prednisone, &amp; Pepcid bid.  CoVid test done in ER was negative. Day 6---The facial swelling/redness/itching remained but was improved.  I was very tired. Day 7---Same as Day 6, but less swelling. Day 8---Facial swelling/redness/itching gone, but tiredness remained.  Started to notice a chest heaviness/feeling of constant excitement in the center of my chest, even when at rest. Day 9-10---Tiredness remained.  Intermittent Chest heaviness/feeling of excitement in the center of my chest remained. Day 11---Feeling more normal.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the injection, I developed a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt a bit light-headed and woozy. I informed the staff at the site that I felt this way and they asked me to remain for additional monitoring. Over the next 15 minutes, my tongue began to swell. 15 minutes later my jaw began to stiffen and I had difficulty swallowing. After another 15 minutes the staff asked the EMS personnel to screen me and check my vitals. All were normal. After another 30 minutes of monitoring by EMS the symptoms began to subside and I went home.   At home, I began to feel weak and went to bed. My body began to ache and I took ibuprofen to ease the pain. Within 15 hours of receiving the dose, I had a 100.9-degree fever and chills. The fever lasted the next day. I could not get out of bed for the next day. When I tried to sit up and watch TV I had back pain so severe it left me in tears.  I went back to bed and stayed there until the following morning. All told, I could not get out of bed for 36 hours.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

                                                Moderna Vaccine. No immediate reaction. 1/13/21 I noticed there was still a sizable lump at the injection site. Called our Employee Health hotline and they advised to apply heat and massage the area. 1/14/21, I applied heat and massaged the area and within a few hours the injection site started to get red and increase in size, and my eyes began to itch and swell. Took a Benadryl and in the morning there was more swelling in my face. Went to the dr, they couldn&#39;t confirm if was or wasn&#39;t vaccine related, and advised to continue taking Benadryl and apply cool compress if arm was painful. Swelling continued on 1/15 and 1/16. Arm still has a large spot, it is less red in color now, there is still slight heat at the injection site. I have been taking at least 1 Benadryl for the last 7 days now.

                                                20 hours post vaccination (dose 1 of the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine), I woke up feeling soreness in my left arm which is the injection site. I started feeling dizzy, a buzzing in my ears and broke into a sweat. I tried to stand up and walk over to my bed, but lost my balance and collapsed for about 5 seconds. Once I regained consciousness I stopped sweating, rested for a bit and then was able to resume normal function (drinking water, coffee, something sugary).

                                                My cheeks and upper lip became swollen hours after having the vaccine. I had no other signs of an allergic reaction. In the past, I have had similar, but more severe, facial swelling that from antibiotics containing sulfonamide and fenugreek tea that also did not progress past facial swelling. I took Benadryl (two capsules). The swelling did not progress. They did have me wait 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine due to my history of allergic reactions to other things and nothing occurred during that time frame.  My cheeks and lip are still  very slightly swollen and I plan to take a second dose of Benadryl to make sure it completely dissipates.

The nurses on staff said that several other people had reported the same. Within about 30-40 minutes after leaving the clinic, I also had bilateral facial numbness and tingling lips. The arm and facial numbness lasted for about 5 hours and lessened right before I went to bed and this morning only my arm hurts (normal vaccine site pain).

Went ER at 12:55 pm and they did an EKG - not a regular heartbeat; blood work and x-ray. My BP was high - 143/122; I had low potassium; white blood cells higher than normal -10.9 (in mid Nov - only 7.5); They gave me potassium to take. December 30, when I got home at 6:30 - nausea started and I was throwing up two-three  days in a row more than 5 or 6 times a day; weird metallic taste; fever at night; arm pain and swollen under my armpits. (Stayed off work three days.) Went to dr on Jan. 7 - did a follow up appt. and did all the blood work again and everything was back to normal.

Nausea, thirst, headache, chills, body aches, 102° fever, exhaustion, and not being able to move arm where shot was. Also experiencing ear issues again which took almost 3 months to dissipate when I actually had covid. Shot was administered around 1700 on a Wednesday. Felt fine going to bed. Woke up to the headache that quickly progressed to everything else.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills and body aches. I then went to bed. I was awoke shaking from being in such significant chills my body hurt all over through the bones something I have an experienced in a long time. I continue to try to sleep and rest the best I could but I stood up in the morning I felt tunnel vision and thought I was going to pass out I laid on the ground at a safety and collected myself over the course of five minutes. When I stood up I am mediately thought I was going to vomit Splash cold water on my face I force myself to eat and drink and take Tylenol and symptoms lessened but remained over the entire course of the following day another 24 hours. I?m about to go to bed and I will not know how I feel in the morning but this is definitely something I did not expect. My entire doctors office received vaccination on the same day out of a group of 15 people two of us had severe reaction similar to what I described and the other female that felt sick like me had worse symptoms and high fevers with the stores as well she has remained out of work as a result of her symptoms. We are both nurse practitioners so it?s not easy to cancel our schedule. I ended up tapping out today despite my leftover post vaccine side effects.

                                                I got the vaccine on 30th of Dec. Had a sore arm, runny nose, woke up the next day to puffy eyes and bruises under my eyes (still hasn&#39;t gone away) Since then I have had GI issues. Constipation. It aggravated my face. I had nausea. I had a rash on my arm and on my chest the following Tuesday. My face were tingling and very flush. I had a lot of allergy and sinus issues. Sinus pressure. This all unfolded the first few weeks after receiving the vaccine. I do have fibromyalgia. I had allergy testing done. I am allergic to bee stings. Was having a lot of vaginal issues. Watery eyes and have hot flashes followed by chills. Hives on chest. Difficulty swallowing. Rapid heart rate. I have seen three doctors that have told me my hear rate was fast. Glands have been swollen for two weeks. The night after I got the shot it was really rough with body aches.

                                                Arm started to be painful about 2 hours after injection. By evening I could barely move my arm. Around 10pm pain was so bad I was crying.  Could not lift arm. Could still move my hand. Woke up multiple times in pain.  By morning arm pain had decreased but felt lethargic and weak. By noon I had taken a nap. My 15 year old daughter said she came to check on me and I woke up but my eyes were rolling on the back of my head. I slept for over 3 hours. Woke up sweating  achy. Still felt tired and lethargic. Arm was still sore but was able to move it around. Went to bed again around midnight- woke up today (Thursday) and felt much better.

                                                Patient reported numbness and tingling within 4 hours of administration.  Received first dose of the Moderna Vaccine and I had a reaction.... Reported that her ear to my chin went numb and my lips and tongue were tingling and it lasted hours!!! It felt like my Bell?s palsy came back.  She reached out to her PCP to ask about whether or not she should get her 2nd vaccine - worried about Bell&#39;s Palsy recurring or worsening tongue swelling/tingling.

She stated the following symptoms came on &#34;Like a wave&#34;: Dizziness, light headedness, ears ringing, sound pulsing, and her vision began to go black. She described the field of vision closing like that of a loony toons show ending (coming from the outside in).   Patient was found to have her eyes closed, hyperventilating at a rate of 28 breaths per minute. Ice pack placed on her neck. She was coached to slow her breathing, instructed to hold her breath for 10 seconds, then to release it slowly. She did this for 3 minutes. She related her body felt tingly all over. Encouraged patient to continue the slow breathing. As patient began to feel better, she related that she has a known needle phobia. She expressed that she becomes anxious even when she is not the one receiving a shot, and this fear stems from a traumatic experience of her son having a seizure after a shot. She works at a school and when they do first aid training and cover the diabetes section, the pictures of needles make her anxious. Patient provided with therapeutic communication, encouraged to discuss fears with her counselor. Patient remained seated in clinic until she felt well enough for her husband to drive her home.

I started feeling this pain about 2 weeks after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (I received the second dose in my right arm). It presents itself about 3 times a day, nothing ignites or lessens the pain, it feels like a sharp stabbing pain, intensity 4/10 and lasts less than a second. Also presenting itchiness inside the ear canal.  Additionally, swollen and painful to the touch axillary lymph nodes. I noticed them about 2 weeks after receiving the first and second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. They appeared on the same side of the vaccinated arm (i.e., left arm vaccinated, left axillary lymph nodes). They&#39;re sensitive to the touch, intensity 5/10. Did not take NSAIDs to reduce the pain (was afraid it might have been a breast lump, but ultrasound ruled it out and confirmed it was a swollen lymph node).

Afterwards I had some chest pain.  the feeling of Heaviness on my chest . Took tums helped a little then the feeling came back. Went for a 2 mile walk helped a little then came back.

                                                Approximately 5-10 minutes post-vaccine, patient stated that it felt like her tongue was swelling, and she was beginning to have trouble breathing. Patient&#39;s complexion also became somewhat pale, and possibly pink hued. Patient used an inhaler several times during this episode. Patient was given 50mg of oral diphenhydramine shortly after her complaint was made. Emergency responders was called after administering the diphenhydramine. Responders arrived a few minutes later, and patient was conscious and communicative, and did not appear to be in major distress. At one point, patient mentioned that it was possible she was just panicking.

                                                Here is my story. Part 1: I had my second Moderna vaccine on 2/16. 36 hours later I was laying In bed when I all of a sudden felt very strange- sort of faint - like I was going to pass out. Then I started feeling like my Body was going numb. We called 911. I was taken to the ER. What followed was about 15-20 ?neurological? episodes (every ten minutes or so) where my entire body from head to toe became paralyzed- I couldn?t move any of my limbs. I also had no sight. I was not blacked out Bc I could hear everything that was happening. It was also accompanied by extreme chest pain, numbness, contratcing of muscles in chest cavity that felt almost like a heart attack. Each individual episode lasted about 3-5 minutes and then slowly the paralysis would undo and I?d regain feeling. And then the full episodes would start over a few minutes later. This went on for a few hours repeatedly while in the ER.  I was admitted for testing  and monitoring for two days (EEG, EKG, MRI, Catscan) all clear. Once discharged I had lingering neurological symptoms but not the full paralysis episodes. Lingering symptoms included severe chest pain, numbness/weaknesses predominant on the left side as well as other random areas. I was very weak and tired. I started to improve very slowly - by day 10 post hospitalization I was starting to feel like things were turning the corner and maybe I was on my way to recovery. Part 2: I started to finally feel more improved from the lingering neurological issues and then all of a sudden around 5:30PM I was in the kitchen making dinner for my kids on 3/2 and the episodes started again. Called 911. Again, every ten minutes or so they came on (maybe 15-18 episodes) of complete paralysis- this time accompanied by seizure like rapid eye movement from side to side and fluttering of the eyes. I was readmitted to the hospital where the episodes repeated to happen again, maybe 15-20 times. I was admitted. They did a 24 hour video EEG which ?caught? the episodes on video and sound but did not appear negatively on the EEG in terms of abnormal brain activity. I?ve been released as they say there is nothing to do. I have lingering muscle weakness in my eyes- I can?t focus my eyeballs or ?track? on an eye exam and continued muscular chest pain. I also have a lot of PTSD from the trauma of the events.

These symptoms were over the course of 2 hours following the shot and subsided significantly by 2:30 p.m. (3/17/21)--- the start time of onset of symptoms is my best estimate.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

I woke at at 4/5 am Sunday morning, and it hurt to open my eyes, head ache, my whole body hurt every where, breathing made my sides hurt. I had a mild fever on and off. I felt better by Monday late afternoon.   Monday, my arm where I have the injection started to flare up, it was hot, red, was so itchy that I scabbed up from scratching it. This lasted for two days. The days following that it didn&#39;t itch as much, but on occasion the itching would flare up where I felt the need to scratch it intensely. I would say the itching subsided at around 5 days after the shot.

                                                Within 72 hours of my 2nd dose, I experience extreme vertigo with dizziness, nausea, and ringing in my left ear (tinnitus). The vertigo symptoms subsided after 2-3 days and treatment in the emergency room however the tinnitus has become permanent in my left ear for over 3 weeks now. It is loud enough to disrupt my sleeping and my ability to hear from my left ear. I still have slight dizziness spells intermittently. Additionally, I have begun to experience extreme arthritis and muscular pain throughout my body, which begun 2 weeks after the 2nd dose. I have begun to lose function intermittently of my feet, fingers, and arms at different times throughout the day.

                                                Shot given at 3:47- approximately 3-5 minutes later started to experience blurred vision, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.   Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

                                                Just about 15 mins after recieving vaccination, I  experienced increased shortness of breath, feeling weak, slight headache, and my heart seemed to race.  When I shared this with the pharmasist, she did not offer to take vitals nor seemed concerned.  She suggested that I was experiencing anxiety, and that it was not a typical reaction to the vaccine.  However, each day since vaccine I have continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.  Today, 3 days after the vaccine, I had more shortness of breath than I had since first contracting Covid-19(which was on 10th of Dec).  I also was having to stop walking several times every 5 mins or so in order to catch my breath, feeling weakness and fatigue.  My sense or taste/smell is gone as well. I was so short of breath today, work was worried anough about me they urged me to go home and call my doctor.  I now have a tele-visit set up with my doctor today.

Today on day four I am Almost back to normal but still some puffiness in both cheeks and bottom lip.  Per my physicians advice I will be on a 5day course of oral prednisone (10mg 2x/day)  The other adverse event I experienced was starting day 2 I had extreme pain and itching as well as some cyst like bumps on both my feet as well as very mild itching on my palms.They are improving on day 4 but still super itchy. I have been advised to take Benadryl as needed for that.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

Even the joints of fingers aches but the pain in my lymph node in my left armpit felt like someone hit me with a baseball bat (injection was in left arm).

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 10 minutes after receiving vaccine throat began tingling and I noticed my heart rate was 164 on my apple watch.  Notified nursed overseeing the monitoring.  Nurses began hooking my up to monitoring equipment. Heart rate came down to 120.  Nurses noticed flushing in face and blotchiness on arms. After an additional 15 minutes of monitoring, flushing was still present as well as throat tingling (just tingling, no swelling), so nurses sent me to the ER for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to ER temperature was 100.2 F. (Temperature before vaccine was 97 F, no fevers recorded after ER visit).  In ER fluids and zofran were given and was released after two hours of monitoring.  In the evening I experienced moderate pain in the left arm (very painful to lift arm above shoulder level) that lasted about 24 hours.  I also had a mild to moderate headache that lasted about 24 hours, beginning the evening of the vaccine.   I also experienced mild to moderate nausea that began the day of the vaccine (Saturday, 12/26) and was on and off through Wednesday, 12/30.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

I also had loud ringing in my ears. I experienced Nausea and weakness. My face and chest went numb. I had extreme body chills, and shook for the majority of Friday. On Saturday I sweated uncontrollably, and was sweating through my clothing. The injection site swelled and raised about and inch of my skin and was very red. The red area started the size of a baseball and has progressively grown in diameter over the course of the last four days.

                                                Approximately 10 hrs after the vaccine, I woke up very thirsty. When I went to get water, my brain and body felt disjointed. My brain was telling me to walk forward and my legs were stumbling all over as I tried to walk. I went back to sleep and woke up hours later more stable but still with my head feeling very light(not quite dizzy). I was slightly nauseous and just blah most of the next day. I?d get slightly out of breath when talking for awhile. I was in a deep fog. To the point it took a few minute to process the sound my dog made with it coming from him. Overall, I felt like I was drugged or really intoxicated. I worry about my 2nd dose!

                                                About 5 hours after the vaccine, I started feeling really hot especially in head and face. From there, I had fever and it started going up. Body aches; joint pain; headache; and this went on all throughout that night (Jan 2 and morning of the 3rd). The 3rd, my fever wasn&#39;t as high but I still had fever and felt really really tired and body aches/joint pain. On the 4th, when I woke up I noticed that I didn&#39;t have any taste and smell and so I went in and got tested for COVID 19 (the 4th) - positive for COVID-19.  I went to a clinic that could do a Rapid test. Doctor there gave me Azithromyocin - 2 the first day and one every day after; Dexamethasone once  a day for 10 days.  I could  Tylenol and Motrin (alternating because my fever wouldn&#39;t go down). The highest my fever got was that Saturday night got up to 103 degrees. The last day I had fever was the 5th of January and that was 99.8. Jan 7, 8, and 9th -  I continued to have other symptoms like really severe headache; no appetite; felt super tired and could hardly get out of bed. Those symptoms resolved about the 10th of Jan -  headache almost went away and fatigue was still there and it is still there. I got out of quarantine on the 15th and I went back to work on the 18th - I had no fever. I just felt tired. I couldn&#39;t sleep - throughout. I finally started being able to sleep just a couple of days ago. I had the second dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 30th - I had fever again; body aches; joint pain.

At 10:15 that evening I started to become chilled.  By 11 p.m. I had uncontrollable shaking chills, accompanied by a fever of 101 and body aches.  By 1 a.m. I was still having uncontrollable shaking chills and severe body aches and  Body sweats.  I had a sweatshirt on over a tee shirt and a heating pad on between the two with two comforters on. At 3 a.m. I had to take ibuprofen (800 mg) because my body hurt too bad to even touch my skin.  My eyelids hurt.  My toes hurt. My ears hurt.  My fever was up to 103.  I fell asleep finally and woke up at 730 a.m. feeling much improved besides some mild chills.  I made the wrong decision to go to work.  I arrived at work at 830 and by 10 a.m. I started to get chilled again, achy and feeling like I was going downhill again.  I decided to go home.  By the time I got home at 11 I had chills again, fever of 101 and body hurt.  I slept until 3 p.m. at which time I woke up chilled and wanted to take a hot shower.  My other half noticed I had hives on my face (which I documented in photos).  I took a benadryl and went back to sleep.  Woke up again at 7 p.m. tried to eat something but had no interest and just wanted to sleep.  Throughout the night I would get the sweats that would drench through my t shirt.  The following day, 2 days post 2nd dose I slept all day.  Not as chilled but very tired.  Noticed injection site was now red and swollen, again documented in pictures.  Slept all day.  Today injection site has gotten slightly larger based on markers I marked on my skin, but not as red.  Not too energetic but much improved.

I started getting really cold and began shivering and had GI discomfort. At the 20&#43; minute mark I went to get the nurse. She returned with BP cuff and pulse ox, BP was elevated as was pulse. I continued to have waves of feeling weak, shaky and sick but nurse said I should go home an lie down at the hour mark. Once home my throat felt really dry and strange, I had a BM, laid in bed about 20 more minutes and decide decided I wanted to get check out. Went to ER and was seen ~3 hours after vaccine. BP and heart rate were still both up. I still felt nauseated, dizzy and cold. I was given Meclizine and Zofran. BP retuned closer to normal after about 40 mins and I was released, feeling better but fatigued.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

                                                I received the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 01:49 pm. Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for a health checker and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on a health checker under ?other&#39;&#39; multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud&#39;s Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series. On 2/3/2021 at approximately 1:45 pm, I received the second Moderna Covid-19 vaccination.  On 2//10/2021, small red, itchy bumps started to appear on both sides of my neck. On 2/15/2021, a bump appeared above my right eyebrow with what felt like a pimple. On 2/21/2021, the ?pimple? had spread towards my inner eye and above my right eyebrow making my right eyelid swell. I received telemedicine care via an e-visit over telehealth with an urgent care and was provided an antibiotic for facial cellulitis. On 2/22/2021, I had one episode of emesis, and went in person to an urgent care. I received a different prescription of an antibiotic, and was provided with instructions of signs and symptoms of what to look for when to report to the emergency room. On 2/25/2021, my right eye started tearing up and the pain began to intensify. I was provided medical care by a Neuro-ophthalmologist and given a primary diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Presently, I have multiple areas of herpes zoster appearing on various areas of my head, shoulder, and chest that do not follow specific dermatomes.

The second day, I also had  body aches.  It&#39;s been about 3  weeks and I have some pain on my back and chest. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s related. l seemed to have it after the vaccine.  I also feel out of breath often.  I am now fearful of getting the second vaccine,  since the first one was so bad for me.

I didn&#39;t have the extensive shortness of breath. 27th, I woke up with painful sinuses - I couldn&#39;t touch my face. Because there was a gap between that one day of symptoms - couldn&#39;t touch my maxillary - I did go get a COVID swab. They came back negative. I had to use my inhaler every day and continued with post nasal drip to the point I lost my voice for weeks. Which happens with post nasal drip because it irritates my throat. Nothing was taking care of it.I had a lot of thick phlegm. There is a lot of congestion in my sinuses which triggers my asthma. I did saline spray; allergy pills and there was such swelling in my sinuses -  nothing came out my nose - just went down my throat.  History of Atrial Flutter - I have been needed to shocked before but this was different. I had missed one of my meds that controls heart rate and not the rhythm - I went into the Atrial flutter - on January 19th - early morning. I took extra medication to chemically break it which it didn&#39;t do. it. After 8 hours, I didn&#39;t convert so I started Zyratol 20 mg daily - and I couldn&#39;t break and I continued to take an extra dose once a day of the Flecainide - I still didn&#39;t break. I stayed in it until the 23rd .  January 21st vaccine at 09:30 am.  I didn&#39;t go to the ER because I am use to trying to break it.  Talked to doctor on the Phone - around the 20th or 21st of January.

                                                Received vaccine Thursday afternoon. Waited for a half hour after receiving the vaccine, as there is a history of anaphylaxis. On the drive home lips began to swell and the lips felt numb. Patient went home and took some Benadryl which seemed to help.  Friday 3/5  Patient woke and her arm was swollen at the injection site and was very painful. Patient also complained of a headache at that time. Later that same day, Patient developed a rash at the injection site and intense itching all over her body including her face. Patient went to the Medical Center ER. At ER the staff evaluated her and administered IV steroids and Benadryl and sent her home with instructions to return in worsens. Saturday Patient complained that her throat began swelling and so she went back to the ER. The  ER gave more IV steroids and Benadryl, a breathing treatment (nebulizer), and gave 2 doses of epinephrine. Due to Patient&#39;s continued symptoms and gradual worsening condition the medical provider at ER felt  it necessary for Patient to be admitted, however, due to the smaller size and limited resources at ER it was decided for Patient to be transported to Hospital. Patient has remained admitted at Hospital since then, and yesterday (Sunday) she required another dose of epinephrine due to tongue swelling.  Patient reports that she is being given IV Benadryl and steroids, and she will not be discharged today. Today Patient is also reporting a burning sensation with urination.

While I was there, I was given Tramodal of pain observed for several hours then told that my impending facial paralysis was just a allergic reaction to the shot, to take Tylenol and Motrin for pain. For 2 more days my face continued to swell and I suffered in pain , I went back to the urgent care , where I was provided something for the ?supposed allergic reaction? pain and to help with the swelling, well a few days  the new meds t last Thursday my mouth gushed with this fluid of Blood and puss mixed , very thick. I went back to the urgent care and they could not tell if this was coming from my jaw or my gum( also I have braces only on my top teeth and I went to the orthodontist the same day I received the shot, I go every for weeks) I was given more meds to take with the ones that I was already prescribed and told to contact my orthodontist because even though my face has gone down I have a hard knot in it that possibly holds infection.

                                                This female patient received her second Moderna vaccine after experiencing no side effects from the first. She has a history of anaphylaxis to foods so she was observed for 30 minutes without any issues. As she went to her car to leave, she began feeling some throat itchiness and returned to let us know. We went to our first aid room and observed her further. Vital signs were taken and she had a slightly elevated blood pressure but good oxygenation and no change in voice character or breathing.  She was very anxious at this point and began saying she felt like her throat was going to swell .  It was decided to administer Epi and as soon as the needle inserted, she expressed immediate relief of her symptoms. An ambulance was summoned and she was brought to the ER.

She felt very tired and woozy almost right away.  She developed severe headache and aches/chills the next day. She was seen in RC the next day, also with severe jaw pain.  she was given oral rehydration packets, zofran, toradol.  The next day she couldn&#39;t tolerate po, had to have IVF and zofran.  She felt better after the visit on 2/18/21.  She still gets some mild nausea and intermittent migraines. Is concerned re: her lithium as potentially contributing to the dehydration, so pt reduced her dose and is feeling somewhat better but is still needing her imitrex relatively regularly.

Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for V-Safe and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on V-Safe under other&#39;&#39; multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud&#39;s Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series. On 2/3/2021 at approximately 1:45 pm, I received the second Moderna Covid-19 vaccination.  On 2//10/2021, small red, itchy bumps started to appear on both sides of my neck. On 2/15/2021, a bump appeared above my right eyebrow with what felt like a pimple. On 2/21/2021, the pimple had spread towards my inner eye and above my right eyebrow making my right eyelid swell. I received telemedicine care via an e-visit over telehealth with an urgent care and was provided an antibiotic for facial cellulitis. On 2/22/2021, I had one episode of emesis, and went in person to an urgent care. I received a different prescription of an antibiotic, and was provided with instructions of signs and symptoms of what to look for when to report to the emergency room. On 2/25/2021, my right eye started tearing up and the pain began to intensify. I was seen in an outpatient Ophthalmology Clinic and diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus and postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia. I was placed on a leave of absence from work as of 2/26/2021. 3/1/2021, I was seen in-person appointment with my primary care provider hoping to provide a work note, further assessment of shingles that have spread over neck and back of neck. Primary Care Provider noted diminished bilateral lower extremity muscle weakness and absent deep tendon reflexes.  Primary Care Provider referred me to the Emergency room ASAP to rule out Guillain Barre and herpes zoster meningitis.  Evaluated by the Neurology Consult team in the Emergency Room. Discharged with diagnosis of disseminated shingles and muscle weakness. Appointment made to Neurologist follow up on March 16, 2021 and for EMG/NCS.  On 3/5/2021, seen in-person by Primary Care Provider for hospital follow up. I was feeling diminished sensation increasing in feet, muscle weakness and pain radiating up my back along my spine at times, and near my shoulder/neck. Primary Care Provider was unable to do anything for me.  3/5/2021, followed up with Neurology in person. An order placed for MRI with IV Contrast of Brain and Spine. 3/9/2021, MRI of brain and Spine with IV Contrast completed. 3/9/2021, a re-eruption of shingles started to appear on bilateral areas of my chin and middle of my forehead close to my eye where the nearly resolved shingles were on my eye. 3/10/2021- Order placed for lesions to be swabbed for HSV and VSV and Dermatology Consult placed for 3/15/2021.

Day 3: Stayed the same. Day 4: Extreme fatigue and napping. Hives started to clear. Day 5: Fatigue continued.  Day 6: Fatigue and napping continued. I got some mild chills during these days of fatigue, but never took my temperature. I basically felt like i had the flu. My hives were mostly clear by day 5. Day 7: Fatigue continued. Day 8: Exactly 1 week later, Thursday. Fatigue lessened. No naps. However, I began getting nerve pain in my right ear. Day 9: Fatigue still clearing. Ear pain continued to feel like nerve zingers; I also felt them a little bit in the back of my head on the right side. Day 10: Nerve pain continued. Woke up with a sore throat and drippy nose on left side. Took allergy medication (loratadine) in case it was allergies. Day 11: Nerve pain not as frequent, but sore throat worse. Felt like strep but only on left side. This is today. I will most likely get tested for covid on wednesday just in case i contracted it at the vaccination clinic.

By evening, I was very cold, had horrible stomach pains and was very achy. I never experienced a fever but felt extremely chilled. Approximately 12 hours after the vaccine (10p), I began to experience a sore throat and tingly in my mouth, tongue and lips. I began to feel pins and needles across my body, like a skin tingly feeling. I took advil to help with the pain and chills, which helped. And then I took Benadryl when the tingling began and that helped as well.  Today, I am still experiencing stomach pain and nausea.

I have continued to have ear pain along with my ears popping when swallowing and increased sensitivity to noise. I also experienced intermittent moments of near vertigo that has since improved. The ear pain continues now 2 1/2 weeks later along with ear drum discomfort. My doctor has advised me to begin taking allergy medication despite no history of allergies in the past.

When I got in my car I noticed that my right jaw and cheek felt numb so I went back into the facility and told the nurses and they had me wait an additional 30 minutes. They also submitted a report. During that waiting time a part of my tonight and mouth also felt numb. I did not experience pain, nor swelling. After 30 minutes there was not a change so I went home. It lasted for another hour or two. Did not have other issues or symptoms with my jaw following that. After my first vaccine dose I did have jaw pain and submitted a VAERS report: #243828.

                                                I received my shot at 1:52 pm.  Around 10:00 pm I suddenly had terrible tinnitus  in my right ear.  It was more severe than any ear ringing I have ever experienced. It got worse and then better and then worse on and off for about 2 hours. At that point the ear ringing got better and was similar to general ear ringing I have experienced. I have only experienced bad ear ringing once (actually in my left ear) since then. I also had dark purple nickel sized bruise at the injection site that took 2 weeks to heal. I did not seek medical treatment for the ear ringing and I assume that the issue has resolved itself.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

Felt tired the rest of the day. I awoke at around 2am the next morning with diarrhea, extreme chills and bodyaches, and a headache. My right arm was very sore, but I expected that. I went back to bed and awoke for work at 6am. My injection site was red, puffy, and heat to the touch. My body ached as if I had a bad case of the flu. The next morning, I awoke with nausea and vomiting. It lasted until around 9am.  The aches have eased up, but I remain very tired and my injection site is still very red, puffy, and warm to the touch. It feels as if there are knots under the skin.

                                                6 days after vaccination, I started to feel ill. Throat slightly scratching, almost like I was getting a cold. Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

                                                Legs extremely weak and felt like muscles were not functioning well. Knees were buckling while standing. Started about 4 hours after vaccination. Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.

I had a rash around site that progressed up to the right side of my face and also right side of my lower back the following day. The rash was also accompanied by blotches and is still there only on the side of the injection. I had metallic taste for on and off the first 2-3 days. I am feeling a bit better, well enough to work today. Still very fatigued. On Thursday I also had a 102 fever that Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help me at all at night. I finally stopped sweating yesterday. The blotches are now improving . Only thing that remains is the fatigue.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine last Thursday (1/14/21) at clinic and had a pretty severe reaction within a few minutes of the receiving the vaccine. I didn?t alert anyone because I wasn?t sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. I felt hot suddenly, then very dizzy/faint, then experienced very bad tinnitus and couldn?t hear any of the words being spoken around me, just muffled sounds. I felt slightly nauseous, was seeing spots, and felt very close to fainting. My pulse was racing. I did deep breathing  until it subsided (which was about 10 minutes later). For the next 5 days after the vaccine, I experience extreme soreness and weakness in the left arm where the injection was given. I also had redness and itching and it was hot to the touch and slightly swollen. I had extreme fatigue and a headache and a loss of appetite. After 5 days, those subsided. 1 week after the vaccine (01/21/21),  I experienced intense itching at the injection site and redness and it was hot to the touch. I also experienced intense itching on my chin and skin numbness in that area of my chin. The chin area resolved after about 4 hours. The arm itching did not resolved. i woke up on 01/22/21 with the entire left shoulder area swollen, red, hot to the touch, and extremely itchy. it lasted all day. I woke up on 01/23/21 and the swelling had gone down, but the redness spread to a larger area on the upper left arm and the itching persisted all day. I woke up on 01/24/21 and the redness and swelling was almost gone but the itching was still there and the area that had swollen up felt very bruised, but no visible bruising. Today (01/25/21) there is no more itching or redness but the bruised sensation continues.

                                                40 minutes after my injection (as I drove home) on Friday, I began to feel tingling and numbness in my left hand and weakness in my left arm. Within an hour after my injection , I began to feel tingling and numbness on the left side of my face beginning with my jaw and chin area. Over the following hour, the tingling and numbness spread to my lips, nose, eyelid, eyebrow, and the entire left side of my face and head. Around this time, my husband and son came downstairs to check on me noticed a change in my face and asked me &#34;What&#39;s wrong with your lip? It&#39;s like a different color or something different on one (left) side.&#34; Approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes after the injection, the left side of my mouth and tongue were tingling and went numb. The left side of my face was noticeably weaker than my right and it became difficult to control my left eyelid and lips. My injection site became extremely tender as the evening wore on and I took two tylenol before going to bed to help with the pain. By the next morning on Saturday, the tingling had stopped, and my mouth/tongue were no longer numb, however weakness and occasional numbness persisted on the left side of my face, most especially my jawline and chin area. I noticed my left eye felt dry, so I began using eye drops occasionally. My injection site remained extremely painful throughout the day and I took tylenol and ibuprofen periodically to help with the discomfort and to allow me to sleep. By Saturday evening, no outward signs remained of my facial weakness on the left side, although I could still &#34;feel&#34; the difference. By Sunday morning, the numbness was only sporadic around my jawline and chin and I realized that when taking tylenol or ibuprofen, it seemed to improve sensation in my face. My injection site discomfort abated as Sunday wore on, but a slight weakness on the left side of my face persisted, noticeable only to myself. The weakness has persisted through today (Tuesday evening), however, it does seem slightly improved each day and it is mild. I am able to work and function normally.  I believe that I experienced a mild episode of Bell&#39;s Palsy following my Moderna vaccine, something that I have experienced (much more severely) once before &lt;5 years ago after contracting a strain of antibiotic-resistant strep throat.

                                                The next two days I had a sore arm. But a week later, the following Monday and Tuesday, I had fatigue and headaches. I put the date as Wednesday because that is when the concerning possible reactions began. I woke with clogged ears feeling very sick. I took Advil Cold and Sinus and arranged to miss work. It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected. My ankles were also very tender as I had done a little jogging the day before and I normally walk. As the day progressed I was barely able to get out of bed. Sleeping and just laying there. My highest temperature was 101.25 at 2:45 pm. I had severe chills on and off. I reported these afflictions and was mailed a covid test by Thursday. The test came back negative by Friday evening. Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm. The oddness of that being where my shot was given is what makes me wonder if it was an extreme reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it is a flu. I have never had the body pains I try to describe before.

My lips were getting numb. I was confused and unable to participate in a work phone call I answered.  12:45 I began driving as I felt a little better. Drove 2 miles and pulled over to park and wait it out. Heart still racing, hives still present, chest pains still there and could not inhale deeply.  12:50 I drove the rest of the way home. I took a double dose of liquid Benadryl and laid down waiting for symptoms to pass. They slowly resolved over the next 6 hours.  It is now 1/30/21 and I still feel like crap, but not allergy wise. More like the flu.

She did report that she had a latex allergy so I removed the band aid even though the band aides are labeled latex-free. I checked her vitals and  Her b/p was 114/85 pulse was 84 and respirations 16. Her pulse ox was 95% She was in no apparent distress. The blurred vision resolved in 5 minutes and her vitals remained stable for 30 minutes. I discharged her with no symptoms.

                                                Symptoms were pretty much the same as the adverse event from 1st dose. But this time, it hurt when they injected it. Like a huge sting. And my whole arm got really hot. Got really hot, dizzy. I immediately threw up. They wanted to call EMS but I told them not to do that - and that I would go to the doctor myself. I went home and did what the hospital told me to do the first time - rest; fluids, Tylenol; this time my fever went up to 103. 2 and it went down but shot back up. Started coughing an hour after I got this shot and it was more than last time. Dry mouth and horrible headache. I still have a knot in my arm. Didn&#39;t have that before the 2nd dose. My fever just broke today finally. Still have headaches; body aches a little bit.  Mostly resolved otherwise.

                                                Day 1: 7 hours after the vaccine shot, I experienced mild fatigue and chills. Overnight, I had night sweats and insomnia. (Night sweats are a symptom that started after the first vaccine shot, and had dwindled until the second brought them up again).   Day 2: The next morning, I experienced intense fatigue, dizziness, chills, fever, headache with light and sound sensitivity, nausea, and intense fatigue. I was unable to get out of bed most of the day. I could not sit up without intense effort to even drink water. At approximately 11am, I took 600mg Tylenol, then was able to sleep for 3 hours. When I woke up my symptoms were much better, though I still had mild fatigue and achiness.   Day 3:  I was mildly fatigued but otherwise felt good.   Day 4: I awoke with a series of small rashes on my torso (front, back, and sides), as well as my inner arm. They were red, flat, not raised, and mildly itchy, One was around my umbilicus, a few under my breasts, and other splotched in random other places on my torso. My inner ears were also mildly itchy. I put generic rash cream on the rashes on my torso and arms, and the itchiness subsided. The redness decreased throughout the day, though they were all still visible by evening.    Day 5: I awoke and my entire torso was bright red *except* the places where the rashes had been the day before, which were normal skin color. Ears are itchy again, and skin is very mildly itchy. Other than that, no other symptoms. No trouble breathing, good energy.   I have never had rashes or an allergic reaction like this before. I assume it&#39;s an allergic reaction, due to the itchy inner ears and skin.

                                                About a week after receiving the vaccine (19 Jan 2021), I developed swelling, heat and allergy like symptoms around the peri rectal silicone seton that was placed in 22 December 2020 and was healing normally until then.  I had pins and needles feeling around my pelvic area.  I went to urgent care for severe swelling on 23 Jan 2021 and was given medrol dose pack.  I developed right eye pain, and burning in neck and hear and ears were hot. Stopped medrol dose pack after 4 days and started Valtrex because I though I was having an oro-labial or Zoster outbreak. The burning/tingling sensation developed on left side of neck and ear. Paresthesia started to spread over left side of body. On 31 Jan 2021, severe burning followed by tingling sensation on left side of scalp, neck, arm, hand, torso, and lower leg and foot.  01 Feb 2021 went to ER and brain MRI and labwork was taken.

My breast milk while I was sick with flu like symptoms from the vaccine changed to a chemical taste and it burnt my throat. I tasted it only because my baby was crying every time I was trying to feed her. The vile taste was in all of my breast milk while I was sick until my symptoms resolved 24 hours later. As I got better the taste was less noticeable. I wish I had kept the milk to be tested but ended up discarding all of it.

                                                Event: Allergic reaction on 3/24. The injection site began to itch around 9:30pm after taking a hot shower. Approximately 10 minutes later the injection site area swelled and became &#34;hard&#34; to the touch, then turn red, hot, and tender to the touch. The area affected was approximately 3 inches wide and 4 inches long - it covered the upper arm (deltoid muscle area). Within 5 minutes the itching sensation spread over the upper back on the left side and to the left side of my neck. Approximately 20 minutes later my bottom lip on the left-hand side swelled slightly and turned red and I had a slight difficulty swallowing. My breathing was not impeded. The reaction did not progress further (I had taken allergy medication to stop any further reaction). By 11pm the difficulty swallowing disappeared and the swelling in my lip reduced. By 5:30am I had no trouble with swallowing and there was no facial swelling. The swelling in my arm was reduced by half - although it was still warm, sensitive, and itched. Throughout the day (on 3/25) the swelling and redness at the injection site reduced. Two days after the start of the event, the area is still warm to the touch and will itch on occasion as will my lower left lip.  Treatment: as soon as I recognized it was an allergic reaction, when the area swelled, I took half a Wal-Zyr 10mg tablet (so I took 5mg of Walgreen&#39;s generic brand of Zyrtec) - approximately 9:45pm on 3/24. I took the other half (5mg) of the tablet at 5:30am the next morning on 3/25. No additional medication has been taken since.  Outcomes: The reaction was managed with the Wal-Zyr medication. Currently the injection area is slightly warm and itches on occasion, as does my lower left lip. There has been no change in this condition in the past 20 hours.

At 12:07 she  (she is an RN employee here at the hospital) reported feeling as if she had lump in her throat and asked for some benadryl.  Rapid response team was called at 12:08 as she became diaphoretic, flushed and reported blurred vision. MD ordered an IV to be started and a NS bolus x 1 liter.   She broke out in hives on bilateral upper extremities.   Benadryl, solumedrol, albuterol inhaler, zofran, scopolamine patch were all ordered and given to the patient. She reported that she felt some better and was transferred to the ER at 1245 for further monitoring.

                                                19 days after the vaccine,  I started to have some rash on the forehead, swollen left eye the next day.  I thought it was allergies, but it didn?t get better with antihistamines, triamcinolone,  and antibiotic .  I went to the urgent clinic on the third day and was diagnosed with Shingles. I am prescribed with acyclovir for treatment. I am not sure if it?s related to the vaccine but something triggered it and I?m not in the normal age group that gets it.

                                                Evening of 2nd approximately 6pm diarrhea began with increasing frequency throughout the night. Lasted through the night several times an hour into the next morning.  Around midnight dizziness,, faint and muscle weakness set in with feeling of extreme pressure on neck, especially right side where shot administered. Arms became tingly, tongue became tingly, hard to keep awake.  After 12 hrs of extreme diarrhea, passed out for 12hrs straight. Awoke dehydrated, extreme muscle weakness unable to walk or stand, light headed, nauseous, dizzy, unable to grip or exert force. Felt like head was detached from body due to extreme pressure on neck. Rapid resting heart rate in 90s (usual testing HR in 50s).   Constant rolling waves of abdominal cramps brought dizziness with each cramp, acid reflux, bloating and gas.  These symptoms lasted through the evening of the 3rd into the 4th. Considered going to ER for help, as extreme dizziness and muscle weakness prevented walking. Fell asleep.  6am March 4th developed fever of 101. Continued extreme dizziness, pressure on neck, muscle weakness and feeling faint and extreme lethargy throughout day.  Fever subsided to 99 by evening of 4th.  Ate plain rice evening of 4th, 1st time eating in over 48hrs. Immediately passed out.  Match 5th still feeling weak, hard to stand, limited walking. Diarrhea has subsided, less pressure on neck and less dizziness. Feeling exhausted overall. Fall asleep easily and randomly.

                                                40 minutes after injection my tongue and throat began to swell and then close.  I had no saliva and could not swallow without sipping on water.  I stopped at a clinic to be near a facility in case I could not breath anymore.  They watched me for a bit (though I did not fully &#34;check in&#34;.  The doctor suggested I get checked at an ER.  I went to ER and sat in the ER parking lot for two hours waiting to see if my symptoms got worse.  I did not want to use the ER unless I felt like I was in dire need.  After the couple of hours my symptoms weekend (but were still there).  I went to a friends place to not be alone in case the swelling increased again.  The next night I felt back to normal.  I have never had that reaction to anything, so I was a bit scared.

                                                Not long after I got a quick dizzy spell that ended and I was fine About 7 minutes after I noticed a slight rash on my  upper chest and person checking on me did as well. It was very mild (I had a much worse one with my mri contrast) but she wanted to keep an eye on me and said my 15 minutes  wasn?t up for seven minutes . She stayed with me and very close by. I cannot say enough good things about her. Everyone at this facility were great!  I felt fine and told her that. I was not itchy. At the end of my 15 minutes she said I could pull to the side because I asked to use the restroom and wanted to see if I had it anywhere else. It was already looking better and I notice it also on my right upper leg. I had  a thicker diarrhea without stomach cramps or anything.  I didn?t feel bad or great but just wanted to go home. She asked if I wanted to see someone inside and I declined and she suggested I follow up with my healthcare doctor after making sure I was okay. I took a Claritin I had on me before leaving. My mouth got extremely dry and I drank a large water. If I didn?t not my throat kind of had a mild burn to it and cottonmouth.  I didn?t feel bad but I didn?t feel as good as I did going into the first shot. After arriving home an hour and a half later it would come in waves of not feeling great and then feeling okay. I was very worn out and felt had I not tried to push though it would help. I took a Benadryl at 3 am and Advil . Day two just normal side effects. Fatigue headache nausea which I used  zofran and Advil. My skin feels itching from time to time but no rash. Injection site clear with mild soreness.  My left ear keeps feeling like pressure off and on. Nothing severe to me. .

It?s been 2.5 hrs since my injection and it is almost to my left ear and has made my tongue and lips numb as well. No major swelling or full  dental work type numbness just  mild numbness. That?s the only side affect I?ve had so far that is abnormal for me and how I react to vaccines or flu shots.

Woke on Thursday with right ear swollen, went to urgent care and diagnosed with ear infection.   Developed face paralysis on right side of face on Saturday.   Sharp bolts of pains from ear intermittently radiating up to head.  Went to Doctor who said both outer and middle ear were infected and perhaps swelling was pressing on nerve causing paralysis.   Given medication.   Returned to doctor on 3/8.  Ear infection had cleared.  Paralysis remained.  Diagnosed with Bells Palsy.  Eye will not close, prescribed eye drops.  Cannot smile, frown, raise eyebrows, scrunch nose, etc.   Began steroids and antiviral medications on 3/9.

                                                I had an increasingly worse migraine that spread across my head and face. It lasted for over 12 hours. I was unable to open my eyes, talk, or withstand and noise or light. Ibuprofen nor Tylenol gave any relief.  When the headache began to subside around 7 PM I developed a mild fever of 100 degrees and experienced chills. This lasted until I awoke the following morning.  The next day I was very fatigued.  Soreness at the injection site lasted 4 days.

                                                Started with a funny taste in my mouth almost metallic approximately 20 to 25 min after the injection.  Within a few minutes moved on to a tingling sensation and a scratchy feeling in the back of my throat. The tingling numb sensation moved forward across my palate and tongue and into my lips. My lips and tongue both started swelling.  Since I was at the hospital I went to the ER where they treated me for an allergic reaction.  I was given two antihistamines and an iv steroid as well as fluids.  I was monitored for 6 hours and sent home with prednisone, an allergy pill, and an EPI pen.

                                                Immediately following the administration of the vaccine on Thursday, I tasted a metallic taste.  Within 5 mins I began to having a racing heart and flushed skin.  On my drive home approximately 15-20 minutes following the administration of the vaccine, I began feeling very flushed, continued racing heart, and had a lot of difficulty swallowing.  I tried to push water even though it was difficult to swallow.  Upon getting home I continued to feel these symptoms along with fatigue.  I laid down to rest after feeling extremely fatigued.  30 minutes later I woke up (this is approximately 1 hour - 1.5 hours after the vaccine administration) with a rash all over my chest, my neck and face.  Additionally, the left side of my neck was extremely swollen.  The lymph node on the left side was sticking out about the size of a golf ball.  I continued to have all these symptoms along with then extreme nausea, hot/cold flashes, and flu-like symptoms.   I took three Advil at this time.  These symptoms continued onto the morning (Friday).  In the morning, I still had the rash and swollen neck, so being worried, I took Benedryl and contacted my doctor and sent him pictures of my allergic reaction.  By Sunday, the swelling in my neck and other symptoms subsided.  The doctor returned my message on Monday and instructed me to report this via this form and advised me not to get the second shot, as it looks like  I had a severe allergic reaction to the first vaccine.  He advised me at that time that if I was still having symptoms I should go to the ER.  I no longer was having those symptoms, so I did not go to the ER immediately.

Consulted with Dr. via video visit.  Advised to use tacrolimus topical cream, antihistamine eye drops and other regular medications for reaction. Also advised to use Vaseline to moisturize and protect swollen eyelids, use cold compresses and monitor the symptoms.  Treated symptoms with advised solutions and symptoms gradually went away after 3-4 days.  Same reaction with 2nd vaccine dose, redness, swelling, and irritation of eyelids developed 3-4 days post vaccine.  Going about treatment in a similar manner, will again consult the Allergist office of the reaction.

I felt like crap afterwards and stayed the full 30 minutes too. I had thought maybe it was anxiety, but I&#39;ve broken out all over in hives and I can barely talk now due to how hoarse my throat is. I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!

I was still waiting for the nurse to replace her bandaid since she was bleeding a little more than normal. As soon as the car got out of the tent, I was driving, it felt like my head was being drilled, my vision blurred, everything turned dark, I could not hear, I had a bad headache almost about to faint but I kept on driving slowly to get to the waiting area. By the time I parked, I removed my mask, open the car window and relaxed and just started inhaling deeply.  I felt better soon after and spoke to the nurse there and she recommended drinking fluids the next 48 hrs.  I felt dizzy,  tired but not very sore like the first dose.  2 days later, I still feel dizzy, vision is blurry sometimes and occasional headache, a little tenderness on abdomen and feeling like I am catching my breath sometimes.
