                                                Extremely intense headache that lasted approximately 10 hours. Headache caused nausea, sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound.  I took naproxen 500mg and 1000mg tylenol and neither did anything for the pain.  I also tried ice and heat, neither of which helped with the pain either. Pain reached intensity of 7.5/10.  This was by far the worst headache I&#39;ve ever experienced.

The vision is in my periphery, lower right quadrant. It comes and goes but is mostly present throughout the day.

I was talking to people that were not there. I felt completely out of control. The only thing that helped was forcing myself to focus on the TV, which was extremely difficult. Symptoms started to die down around 3 AM, but did not go away. I slept for 4 hours.  1/20 8 AM- felt like and still feel like I am not in reality, I feel disassociated with my body (like its not mine), slightly out of control of my thoughts, I see subtle black and white flashing like last night but not as intense, paranoia like last night/not as intense, cant concentrate.

                                                a few days after getting the first dose I noticed that my BMs has a different smell to it. Thought that it was a bit of a change due to just getting the shot. Then the next day I had breakfast and it had a hint of that smell and taste. but didn&#39;t think nothing of it thought they were just having a bad day. I still had that smell when i used the restroom. Seemed like when i got the second dose the smell became stronger. At work I walked into a certain room and it had that smell, which was weird cause it&#39;s a distinctive smell . It&#39;s hard to describe, but it&#39;s like a spoiled. sulfur, gasoline smell. I ordered the bread pasta bowl from and it had that gross smell so i couldn&#39;t eat it. I love peanut butter, but i noticed that foul taste. I smelt it and had a hint of that gross smell and a bit of PB. The coffee at work has that gross smell to it as well. Certain foods, drinks, or odors have that smell and taste to me. So I&#39;m pretty much trying to figure out what foods and drinks i can have and what places i can go to.  I get Covid around November, and i did loose taste and smell.

These symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes and then they resolved. I did not have any of these symptoms since it initially happened on 1.8.21 at 230am. I did not seek medical care at the time since my symptoms resolved. I did contact my doctor on 2.1.2021 about this and he stated the symptoms I described aligned with symptoms of a panic attack, but if I felt it was related to the vaccine that I can report it.

                                                &#34;I received my first dose of the covid vaccine yesterday, January 4th around 3pm. I have not felt any major symptoms or side effects aside from pain at the injection site. This afternoon I noticed how sore my arm was and started looking up potential side effects of the vaccine to see how long I should expect pain. I was trying to practice lifting my sore arm and then started feeling light headed. My vision went blurry, my hearing was muffled, and I started to feel like I was going to faint and/or vomit. I tried drinking water to see if that would help and when it didn&#39;t I called over to my coworker to tell her I felt like I was going to pass out. She informed our boss, who called Employee Health. They both walked me downstairs to Employee Health.&#34;

My throat was tingling ajd I had what is best described as ?on and off? rushes throughout my body. I returned back to the site where I got my test from and reported my reaction somewhere around 5:30.

Around 8pm I was having slight tingling in my throat however it was mentioned it could be the after effect of the sensitivity to the vaccine. I was advised to not have the second dose.

                                                12/31 I had tingling in my throat and was observed in urgent care for two hours with no intervention. It went away by the time I went to bed that night. 1/8 I woke up with a sore arm, did not think much of it and went to work. It was sore all day and when I got home I undressed to take a shower and noticed that it was red, swollen and hot to the touch. I tried hot compresses as I suspected it was cellulitis and marked the borders. It had grown in size the nest morning (1/9) which is when I went back to urgent care and was prescribed 3 days of Keflex. The first dose reduced the swelling and pain in my arm, but by the end of the course of antibiotics it was still red 1/13 I went back to urgent care to be seen for the redness and tenderness. The NP suspected that it may be an immune reaction rather than cellulitis and gave me a single oral dose of decadron with instructions to follow up in 3-4 hours by sending in a picture, and if it did not get better to fill a longer prescription for Keflex. At this point I have taken the prescription to the pharmacy and am waiting until after work to pick it up and begin the script.

                                                I am a MD student who got the first dose of the moderna vaccine on 1/4/2021. I had no immediate reaction other than arm soreness. A couple weeks after my first vaccine, I had a reaction when drinking miralax. Within ~5 minutes of having a few sips of a 17g solution, I had throat tingling/tightening, sense of impending doom, cough, dyspnea, nausea, fecal urgency, and intense chills with shivering. I stopped drinking the solution and my symptoms eventually resolved on their own (the chills and nausea took the longest, about 1.5 hours) - I didn&#39;t even think to take benadryl because it wasn&#39;t clear to me at the time if I was really having an allergic reaction (no hives, no vomiting - but in retrospect I&#39;m concerned). I&#39;ve had miralax in the past without any issues. I&#39;ve never had a vaccine adverse reaction. I have no history of atopy.

Eye doctor to the next day: she said she sees it in virus infected people. She took a picture of the inside of my eyeball. Told me to Treat with Tylenol, put ice on it and wait to see. It was about four days after vaccine everything resolved.  I had the second dose  Today around 7:00 am  and it came back - around 12:30 PM - pain and enlarged blood vessel. I do have a lazy eye in the left eye that I was born with.

                                                I received my shot at 6:53pm. I went to the waiting room and waited until my time was up, I was released from my observation station at 7:11pm. Staff did ask me how I was feeling I had no signs or symptoms upon being released. I left the facility feeling great had no issues at all. I went to pick up my dinner at 7:45pm drove home. When I arrived home my lips started to tingle, and my face was starting to swell up. I inspected the rest of my body for any rash called my mom and read over the fact sheet that was given to me at time of shot. As per the directions regarding the risk of an allergic reaction I called my primary care doctor because my face was beginning to swell, and my throat started to feel scratchy. My primary care doctor called me back and advise I go to the ER immediately to be monitored for an allergic reaction.  I arrived in a Hospital just before 9pm and checked in at the ER. The doctor saw me quickly.  By the time the doctor saw me at the ER my face was bright red I had developed a rash all over my chest and back and on the injection site, my lips were swollen and had mild throat swelling. She gave me a high dose of prednisone and 2 Benadryl&#39;s.  They continued to monitor me for a while until they felt better and discharged me with a epi pen and other meds.

On 1/7/2021 I started to feel short of breath and run down. Sinus infection symptoms. I was sent home from work to get a COVID swab. That evening I lost my taste and began to feel achey. Negative test on 1/10/21. Saw urgent care on 1/9/21 for Covid swab and visit. He diagnosed viral and was sure I was positive. On 1/11/21 my energy returned and I wasn?t achey. Congestion and cough. By 1/13/21 felt fine other than lingering wet cough. This morning, 1/14/21 I noticed my arm itched and looked at it and I?ve got a small red rash around the injection sight and tenderness on palpation.

By 96 hours after vaccination, there was an uncomfortable feeling in my throat as I was breathing which lasted consistently for about 24 hours. Which in that time, I was able to get into contact with health care professionals (Dentist and Ear Nose Throat Dr. )  Who suggested Benadryl, contact PCP, and make sure to have EPI pen.  After taking benadryl for 12 hours, it seemed to have gone down. 6 days after vaccine (day 5 was a holiday), I was able to have a TeleMed appointment with a PA, spoke with my PCP.  Day 8 I was able to see my doctor who confirmed it was an allergic reaction and prescribed a steroid to help my throat/tongue to continue to go back.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/19/2021 at my place of employment. Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

                                                Beginning when I woke up the following morning, I had a very severe headache. It lasted all day until I went to sleep. Figured it was from the vaccine and would be gone the next day. It was still there when I woke up again... and the severe headache and extreme light sensitivity in my eyes lasted for 20 straight days. It kept me from being able to work fully and had to cancel many of my client bookings. I had 2 days of no headaches- felt great- Jan 21st and 22nd. Then again through today it has been there. I can?t describe it very well as it feels like it?s all over and the pain is almost unbearable at times. Even when the headache is lessened/subdued by darkness or ibuprofen, I still feel it strongly in my left temple/behind left eye at all times. I haven?t experienced headaches like this ever before in my life, even though I?ve had random headaches here and there in the past. They have never been there when I wake up in the AM though and sleep has always made them go away previously. Although I can?t imagine this is specifically from the vaccine, it also seems like the timing is so related that I was advised to file a report here.

                                                The reason I came to this site to fill out adverse events is for lower right lip numbness that started about 30 hours after the shot, but I also did have other side effects starting the first day that I will list as well.  I have never experienced anything like this numbness  before in my life, and I am 99% positive it is due to receiving the Moderna vaccine.  I did not find facial numbness as a possible side effect of the vaccine listed, so I searched ?facial numbness COVID vaccine? and was able to find that only  4 of the 30,000 participants in the Moderna trials experienced facial numbness, and that only 3/4 received that active vaccine over the placebo, and so was not considered to be a side effect of the vaccine. I also read that they appeared to be cases of Bell?s Palsey, which I do not believe to be what I am experiencing, because I do not seem to have any symptoms of drooping, just a numb sensation. I woke up around 4:30AM on Wednesday (got vaccine on Monday at 2:30pm) with my lower right lip completely numb. The lower left lip had full feeling, as did my entire upper lip. Friday afternoon (2 days later on the 15th) I finally started to get some feeling back on the inside on my lower right lip. Over the next week (it?s been 12 days now since I first woke up with my lip numb), I have slowly regained a little more sensation each day. While I have about 95% of my feeling/sensation back in my lower right lip, there is still some numbness. Also important to note that while this symptom has been annoying, it has not been painful in any way.   An adverse side effect that happened immediately after getting the vaccccine was that my arm started to itch around the injection site, spanning about 3 inches out in every direction. My arm also got very slightly puffy (only right at the injection site), and moderately pink/red in the same area. They kept me just a little longer than the 15 minutes, but I had no breathing issues, and stated that I felt fine, and was able to leave.   Adverse side effects that started day one of getting the vaccine and lasted 2-3 days: -Severe cotton mouth/dry mouth and throat that started on my drive home about 40 minutes after receiving the injection  -Severe fatigue that started about 2 hours after receiving the vaccine (could not even keep eyes open the first day, and had to call out of work for the next two days) -Moderately severe arm numbness at the site of injection that I noticed around 6 hours after injection.  This symptom bothered me less than others due to lifelong chronic pain, but it was still very difficult to raise my arm to grab things (moved slow like a sloth to be able to push past the soreness).

This writer instructed her to sit down.  This writer then requested assistance from RN.  As RN approached where patient was sitting, patient stated &#34;yeah I&#39;m going to faint&#34; she then fell forward from her chair onto the floor, with the top of her head hitting the floor first.  RN instructed staff to call the Rapid Response Team who was unavailable.  This writer gathered the anaphylaxis/reaction supplies that were on hand.  Patient&#39;s body postured and at that time RN rolled her onto her side.  Patient quickly regained consciousness.  Vitals were taken and stable. Patient was given the opportunity to be seen in the ED multiple times but she declined.   She stated that her lips felt &#34;tingly&#34; and was given 50mg/20mL Diphenhydramine oral solution.  She remained in the COVID vaccination clinic at Medical Center for observation for 40 minutes, at which time her husband retrieved her and escorted her home.

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

                                                I received the vaccination on 1/14 and started to get an itching sensation that night - nothing noticeably or concern and was able to go to sleep. The next morning I was very itchy and red and started to break out in hives that started to get worse and spread through my body. I took Benadryl throughout the day and at night to help my sleep. On Saturday morning my eyes were swollen and red, I had severe hives all over my body and had to go to the ER for some type of relief. This was immediately after I woke up, the right side of my body was extremely hot and I went to the restroom and looked in the mirror and didn&#39;t recognize myself. At the ER, they put me on Prednisone - to take 2 tablets for 3 days, Famotidine - taking 1 tab, 2 times a day for 5 days, and Benadryl, 1 tab, 3X a day until the symptoms subside - It is currently 1/19 and my skin will start to heat up, primarily in my hands and start to itch, but no more hives or anything severe.  I am currently pregnant with my first child, due date 7/7/2021. I have had no previous pregnancies, miscarriages, or abortions.

First 5 day (Tuesday-Sunday) symptoms: swollen, sore, red, &amp; bruised arm at injection spot; body aches, joint  pain of knees, fatigue, no energy, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache, chills, nausea.  I felt better on the 6th day (Sunday), the injection site looked like it was healing and going back to normal on my shoulder. Then on 7th day (Monday) my injection spot started to itch and break out in a huge hive and little hives around it.  It turned into a bright red circle around the injection spot.  It was hot to touch and very swollen. On 8th to current day (11th) my arm keeps getting worse with the swelling, hotness, itching, &amp; redness, and spreading down my arm.

Later that evening I got a stomach ache, the chills/hot flashes, arm soreness and the shakes. Most lasted until the following morning when I got up at 6:15am for work. The following morning I was only experiencing shakiness and arm soreness. About a week in a half later, I developed a rash at the injection site that looked like two large red blobs. The rash was slightly itchy and lasted only a couple of days.

The next day, on 12/29/20, she developed a fever &gt;100, fatigue, chills, sore throat, new anosmia/dysgeusia, chest tightness, headache, GI symptoms, and nasal congestion.  When the symptoms did not resolve, she contacted her doctor on 1/2/21.  They referred her to get a COVID test and that test from 1/2/21 returned positive.  Follow-up on 1/4 showed symptoms stable.  No hospitalization required.  Treated with albuterol inhaler and pseudoephedrine.  Not believed to be related to vaccine, however reporting since my understanding is that VAERs is interested in reports of positive COVID cases following vaccination.

I continued with a persistent headache throughout the week. A presure in my head, worse with standing up, and it made me dizzy when I stood up. On the night of 2/18/21 I developed left sided ear pain. On 2/19/21 I developed a left sided otitis media. On 2/21/21 I developed sudden onset left sided facial droop. I had a negative head CT, and was diagnosed with bells palsy related to the swelling in my ear from the otitis media.   I continue to have significant ear pain, and left sided facial paralysis today.

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

When I first noticed it, I had a numbness by my right ear which subsided but three weeks later, I still have a ringing in my ear which I have never had issues with my ears and I am nervous to get the second dose. There are multiple reports of this very thing on website and it is concerning.

                                                Patient states on day of vaccination she took 400 mg of ibuprofen due to the pain in her left shoulder around the injection site. Patient then woke up the next day (03/13/2021) and noticed that all of her fingers were more swollen than normal. Throughout the day, the patient reports that her finger swelling resolved and did have some facial swelling.  4 days later on 03/17/2021 the patient developed 3 pustules on her left shoulder at the injection site and another on her right scapula. The following day (03/18/2021), the patient began to have swelling around her eyes and lips. She saw her PCP that same day and was prescribed prednisone, Zyrtec, and hydroxyzine; however, the patient continued to develop mild pustules throughout her body.  She presented to the ED on 3/19/2021 for evaluation. The patient was given 10 mg of dexamethasone and recommended to switch to benadryl.  After discharge from ED, patient reports that her rash has continued to worsen as it is spreading diffusely all throughout her body. Patient specifically states that her rash spread from her left arm into her chest, then to her back, groin, face, and lower extremities. On 03/21/2021, patient reports that her pustules advanced into target lesions around her face along with developing some lesions in her mouth, as well. Patient also notes that her skin &#34;burns&#34; whenever she itches it. Patient then went in to be evaluated by a dermatologist and was sent to the ED for admission to the hospital.     Patient currently hospitalized and undergoing work-up/treatment.  Current treatment includes oral anti-histamine, analgesics, topical steroid, and IV fluids.

In the morning I felt normal, besides some remaining pain and redness surrounding the injection site.

                                                I had a racing pulse, my throat was really itchy and tighter than normal ,  my lips were numb, my tongue was tingling.  This happened during the observation period and then I was sent to the ED.  About a week later, on the left arm, looked like I had hives, it was swollen and warm to the touch, pain went down into my wrist. I went to Urgent Care.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine my tongue started to swell and almost felt hairy. My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine: Symptoms after vaccination: Intense pain to my affected arm started around 5-6:00pm the day I received the vaccine. A little while after that I noted terrible body aches and intense chills. I took Meloxicam and Tylenol for the pain to my arm and the body aches. This helped a little.  I ended up going to bed at 7:00pm (same date) due to not feeling well. The chills were pretty intense going up and down my spine and I could not get comfortable in bed or sleep because I was freezing and aching all over.   I am not sure if I had a fever at the time because I felt so weak and chilled that I couldn&#39;t get out of bed but my eyes felt like they were burning. My husband said I was sweating and my skin was burning hot despite the fact that I felt extremely cold. I developed a headache around midnight that lasted until the afternoon the day after my vaccination. I took more tylenol , meloxicam, and benadryl for the pain/headache and I took a mid morning nap. I felt better and more myself by about 4:00pm the next day.  I did not need to receive any medical attention for these symptoms.

                                                Patient had an appointment for her first Covid vaccination today at 10:30am. Pt came in feeling fine but anxious about getting her vaccination. Pt also mentioned to both intern and I that she is a hypochondriac. She got her IM vaccination and sat down for 15 minutes as we monitored her. After her 15 minutes of sitting down in pharmacy area and being monitored by our intern and pharmacist, they asked how she&#39;s doing. Pt expressed she felt fine but had a dry mouth, and the intern told her to call 911 immediately if any shortness of breath occurred, but patient felt fine and left. About 25 minutes later she returned and expressed that she had a metallic taste in her mouth and was anxious about the shot. We asked her to sit down so we can monitor her further and she did. Five minutes later she expressed tongue swollen a little and a little difficulty swallowing but had no trouble breathing. At that time pharmacy intern and I (pharmacist) decided to give the epipen injection and patient agreed. We had the patient sit down for another 30 minutes as we monitored her. Minutes later, pt started to feel better as we continuously monitored her. During this time patient requested water due to dry mouth. We handed her a bottle of water but asked her to please sip and not take big gulps. After 30 minutes patient felt better. No swollen tongue, no difficulty swallowing or breathing and anxiety had been relieved. Patient was notified by pharmacy to call MD to let him know of reaction and was also told to call 911 immediately if have any further reaction. PT felt comfortable to leave at this point.

                                                Was fine immediately post vaccine. Drove home and proceeded with a normal rest of the day at home. Went to sleep around 10 pm. Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

I noticed the tip and the right side of my tongue was tingly. I felt as if I had a lump in my throat. I looked in the mirror and my tongue was not red or swollen. I stayed in the parking lot and spoke with my husband incase I did have an anaphylactic reaction. My symptoms started getting better and fading around 9:45 AM, so I left the parking lot. I notified the vaccine clinic via text message of the reaction after I had already left the site. They offered me to see a provider, but the symptoms already started to go away, so he advised me to take benadryl when I got to my location.  Once I got to my location benadryl was no longer needed because the symptoms were gone. This was about 45 minutes to an hour after the vaccine was administered.

                                                30 minutes after admin of IM, I developed tingling around the mouth and had a panic attack which I thought may be related to anxiety. However, I got the second shot and tingling around my mouth and tongue continued with some heighted anxiety but no panic attack. Two weeks after the last shot the tingling has continued on and off feeling like neuropathy of the tongue and mouth. It typically last thirty minutes or so and then subsides. This has happened 3 x since getting the second shot 3 weeks ago.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Returns to clinic at 0739. Had first dose of Moderna vaccine at 0715 today.  She states that immediately after her lips felt tingly.  She states that she was driving home and she began to feel tingling and numbness into her face around her mouth.  Patient denies having any allergies. Was walking her to the ED and she was talking to nurse, all of a sudden she leaned forward and was coughing and grabbing her throat. Rapid response team called, patient transferred to ED. She gets influenza thoughts without difficulty.  She denies any current URI symptoms no history of heart or lung problems high blood pressure or diabetes.  She denies numbness or tingling in her hands currently.  Currently very nauseated. Patient was given some BENADRYL and some Zofran was watched she still complained of some perioral numbness some labs were obtained potassium is minimally low at 3.5 calcium is also low at 8.1.  This time I suspect this is more of an adverse reaction to immunization shot however if the tingling or numbness persists then a recheck of her electrolytes may be warranted follow-up primary care physician.

                                                Beginning Saturday morning, I began to experience hives, coming and going throughout the day. There were 2 significant episodes on Saturday, one Sunday morning, two throughout the day on Monday. Beginning Tuesday morning, I experienced hives that continued throughout the day. Starting around 1:00 pm, they moved from a more localized area on my upper trunk to covering my entire body, head to toe. I became hypotensive (lowest was 90/60), tachycardic (pulse rate ranging from 100-125), low grade temperature (100.4), noticed a tingling feeling in my lips, a new onset sore throat, and ringing in my ears. My pulse ox remained stable, no oxygen required. I took a claritin chewable approximately 10 minutes after onset of worsening symptoms, then 50 mg of benadryl 3 hours later.  I have continued to take 25 mg of benadryl BID since Tuesday and have remained without any new onset of hives. No medical admissions were required, although I do work in a medical clinic and close observation was available for me.  Only symptom remaining is fatigue, unsure if this is related to benadryl usage or remaining vaccine reaction.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

The vaccinating pharmacist checked the patient and she said her lips were tingling/numb. The vaccinating pharmacist came and got me in the pharmacy. I talked to patient, she said her breathing was fine but felt like she was floating. She began to become incoherent and at that point we got her on the floor and called 911. I did not talk to the EMTs. They transported the patient out of the waiting room.  We reached out to patient after she returned home she is feeling better and may of just had a panic attack. She is making an appointment with her primary care provider.

                                                Face swelling and redness with lip tingling and tongue tingling later after eating a few bites of a home prepared meal that has been eaten several times before. Started eating around 7 pm, have picture of red and swelling face at 7:11 pm. Contents of meal were shrimp, homemade egg noodles, chicken stock, pork, and romaine.  No breathing problems and felt fine besides face warm ness and some anxiety over possibly developing a new allergy, as these symptoms were similar to my adult onset allergies to oysters in 2011. Sought remote care at 7:41, spoke to RN over phone who recommended a video visit, then after video visit was recommended to go to urgent care. Arrived at Urgent Care around 8:50 PM.   Had a steroid shot of solumedrol 125 mg to IM the left arm around 9 pm, then took some Benadryl and famotidine at urgent care. Picked up prescriptions for famotidine 7 days, prednisone 4 days, and Benadryl as needed.  Taking medications now with careful watching of potentially allergic reaction provoking foods such as shrimp, fish, nuts, and wheat.

Developed ringing in her ears and vertigo; like she is drunk and spinning, off balance. Taken to ER, BP up at 152/80&#39;s and HR in the 90&#39;s. Testing completed; all normal per employee. Went home and felt extreme fatigue, and as of 1/18/2021 her arm is still achy, running down her arm to her fingertips and down her backside on the left side in the upper part of the back.

                                                I started to develop a reaction the first evening after receiving the vaccine. My arm was incredibly sore, I had neurological slip ups-i could not think thoughts fully all the way through and my tongue swelled overnight and I woke up to me frantically rubbing my tongue on my back teeth, which is extremely abnormal for myself.  the first night back started aching (I have never felt this pain before now), Developed swollen lymph nodes in my armpit and in my neck and chin on my right side of my body, was extremely lethargic.  and this continued for 3 days when the lymph nodes started to go down, and then an outbreak happened inside the right side of my throat, which is still in place today, seems to be healing now, but continued to get worse for 3 days before starting to heal. I am finally back to a normal level of energy and my mind seems to be working normally again, but my back is still in incredible pain.

These symptoms persisted, so I continued Benadryl every 4 hours for 2 days.  On Saturday 01/30/2021, when symptoms continued.  She advised switching from Benadryl to  a once daily dose of Claritin and Pepcid AC. Switched to Claritin and Pepcid, symptoms persisted but started to diminish in severity. Planned appointment with Primary Care Physician is scheduled for 02/19/2021.

                                                Patient felt light-headed, nauseas, tingly, tachycardic along with a hot-flash upon administering vaccine. Patient was given cold water to drink and I put a fan on her to help cool her off. Once her mouth became tingly, we agreed to call EMS to come check her out. Once EMS arrived, patient was feeling better. EMS checked her vitals and released her. We called her Aunt to come pick her up.

Woke up Jan 4th at 2:13am feeling the place of injection swollen, itchy and with a single hive like a bug bite, felt another on torso on the right side. Felt rapid pulse, got up to check the mirror, eyes swollen and itchy, tongue beginning to swell. Within minutes, started feeling itchy all over my body, specially mucosae, and scalp. Took 360mg of fexofenadine and 20mg famotidine, reaction started to subside. Was up monitoring until 3:45am. Still feeling itchy but significantly less at the before medication. Plan to continue with 180mg fexofenadine a day until all itchiness goes away.

At 6pm called provider friend who suggested patient &#34;use an Albuterol inhaler, Benadryl normal dose and take a hot shower&#34; and that is what she did. &#34;Breathing became easier after that&#34;, cough persisted and was congested. The wheezing resolved that night, and breathing improved. The next day patient was congested, had a cough and the tops of her feet were &#34;extremely itchy&#34;.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

                                                On 1/15 around 6pm, I began to feel extremely fatigued (about 27 hours after my initial injection).  I began to feel severe flu-like symptoms (hot/cold chills, sensitive skin, headache, dry/scratchy throat, fever dreams) which persisted for several hours during the night. The next day (1/16), the fatigue, headache, and chills persisted (although the chills decreased). I took Dayquil before noon and that seemed to help with the symptoms, and Nyquil at night so I was able to sleep. By the following morning, I still had a mild headache and fatigue but continued to improve. I felt normal again on 1/18.   I also had stiffness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site for 3-4 days.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

Migraine headache - started about 20 hours after the vaccine. Took prescription imitrex, which usually solves the problem, and 3 hours later when I still had the migraine I took another imitrex. A couple hours after that it went away.   Eye pain/irritation - left eye - started more than a full week after the vaccine. Left eyeball hurt and also appeared slightly red and irritated. The pain was on and off for two days.

                                                About 8-10 minutes after the injection, my vision got blurry. It was very brief- only a couple minutes long. If it had lasted until the end of my 15 minute post-injection observation period, I would have reported it then, but it didn&#39;t. I decided to include it here, because later in the day, I had another reaction. About 12 hours after the dose -around 7PM- I started getting chills and body aches and abnormally fatigued. The chills were intense almost as soon as they come on. The body aches were mild for the first couple hours and progressed to intense. Both symptoms lasted continuously for about 12 hours, then around 7AM they started to wane. I&#39;m not sure if I should list insomnia as a reaction, but despite how exhausted I felt, I could not sleep. It could have also been just general discomfort that kept me from being able to sleep. Through most of the following day I had mild aches and waves of chills. By the time I went to bed that night (last night at the time of writing this), the symptoms had mostly  cleared and so far have not returned.

                                                The patient received the first dosage of the Moderna CoVid 19 vaccine today. The patient was informed that this will typically cause a sore arm and may cause symptoms of a upper respiratory type with some headache or achiness or even very minimal fever for the next 24 hours or so. Instructions were given to call me if symptoms become severe. Other instructions included taking Tylenol 325 mg 1 tablet 3 times per day as needed for aches and pains. It was reiterated that it is important to be sure to come back for the second dosage in 4 weeks and to continue to practice social distancing and wearing a mask and washing your hands frequently. Special mention was made to help the patient understand that maximal immunity to CoVid 19 infection does not occur until 2 weeks after the second dosage. Vaccine was administered in the deltoid of the left upper arm without incident. Waiting 30 minutes after the injection for evaluation and side effects was unremarkable except for the fact that the patient states that she had some slight blurriness in the left eye about 10-15 minutes after her injection but it went away after 1 or 2 minutes. She had no side effects from the injection at the time of her leaving.

Then waking up at 11:30am Wednesday, the swelling was still there, right eyelid more than left eyelid.  I took a tablet of Cetrizin antihistamine at around 12:30pm.  Around 4pm, the swelling was still there, now left eyelid more than right eyelid.  I took Benedryl at around 11pm, but upon awakening in the morning (Thursday), the swelling is still present, still left eyelid more than right eyelid.  No pain, but there is tenderness of the left eyelid.    I had mild fever, chills, muscle pain, fatigue, headache in the middle of the night after receiving the second dose of the vaccine on Tuesday.  This has subsided.  Mild headache still remains.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

                                                On Thursday (2/18/21) I got a low fever, chills, and was exhausted. The next day I felt very tired but went to work. On Saturday I felt better but started to get right ear pain. I went to urgent care on Monday and was diagnosed with an ear infection and was given antibiotics (Amoxicillin). The ear pain did not improve and I went to another doctor on Friday who confirmed that I had an ear infection and he prescribed me with Amoxicillin-CLAV. He said if my symptoms didn&#39;t improve to see a specialist. Yesterday (3/1/21) I started having vertigo and am having difficulty with balancing, especially if I turn my head too quickly. Since Saturday Feb. 20, I have been experiencing tinnitus, ear pain, jaw pain, a feeling of pressure/fullness in the ear, and can&#39;t hear properly. I am also experiencing jaw tightness and pain.

The reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% , 7 days after receiving the covid vaccine. I started to feel pain to left jaw but figured it was due to dental work. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek was very painful and hard. The pain to face was about 8/10. I iced it, took pain pill and fell asleep. When I woke up my left arm was hot itchy swollen and the arm and jaw were still very painful.    the reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% I started to feel pain to left jaw injection area. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek is painful and hard. By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. I&#39;m tearting it with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1%to deltoid  2-3 times a day.  By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s now 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. My left cheek jaw area is tender but I&#39;ll assume it&#39;s from the dental work. I&#39;m treating left arm  with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1% to deltoid  2-3 times a day. No changes at this time. It&#39;s starting to worry me because it feels like a hard mass that is painful and hot. (left deltoid).

My right cheek felt a little numb and I felt like there was a bit of a lump in my throat. The cheek and throat sensation went away in just a few minutes after I noticed them at first, did not persist. The redness on my face and ears went away, but returned on a smaller area later in the afternoon, then went away and have not returned either in the 3 days since I&#39;ve had it.

                                                on Wed 1/6/21 I had an allergic reaction and am unsure what set it off.  My eyes became itchy, watery and my corneas swelled.  I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

                                                I received my vaccination at approximately 7pm on Friday January 15th. Upon receiving my vaccinations I felt light headed, but after fifteen minutes I was okay to stand up and leave the facility. At around 12:05am  I began coughing and body aches and it continued throughout the night. By morning my cough had subsided, and I felt okay. By 11:30 am on 16th my body and skin began to tingle all over and I felt a burning sensation under my skin. My head began pound and a feeling of nausea came over me. I started feeling very warm about 10 minutes later and decided to take off my sweater and found that I had a large red rash across my chest. My temperature began to rise and my tongue and face began to swell and a feeling of shortness of breath came over me. By 4:00 my fever hit 104.2 and my body began to stiffen up  and my jaw began to clench involuntarily In small bursts for a total of what my family believes to have been 5-10 minutes. After taking 1000 mg of Tylenol my fever dropped to 103 for the next two hours and I began to shake uncontrollably, then it began to spike a again reaching 103.6. My spouse put cold towels on me and opened the windows to our bedroom to cool me down. Slowly my temperature started dropping and it finally reached 101 by 11pm. The next morning, Sunday, I woke with blisters on my mouth and severe body aches.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I began feeling an increase in heart rate about 5-8 minutes after injection. I reported symptoms and site began to monitor my pulse, which was 160. I then drank 32oz of water and took 400mg ibuprofen. I then began to feel dizziness. Blood pressure was normal. My chair was reclined and I was given about 2oz of orange juice. I was then moved to a stretcher and my legs were elevated on a chair. I took a restroom break. I began by walking, but started to see spots in my vision and sat in a wheelchair. I was able to use the restroom and return to stretcher and elevation of my legs. I was then taken to the ER. I used the restroom once more independently. Blood sample was taken. Heart rate was  160, blood pressure was normal. EKG was abnormal and I was given dosage of adenosine. First dose did not show necessary improvement and I was given a second dose, which dropped my heart rate to the 90s. I used the restroom independently and was given an additional EKG, which was normal. During this time my Physician contacted a Cardiologist, for consultation. I was then discharged with recommendation to follow up with cardiologist in 2-4 days.

At which point I took 25mg of Benadryl. The hives subsided after 2 hours of onset. Swelling around the eyes and itchiness persisted through the next day; although symptoms were not as severe as the night prior.  The morning of January 15th, I developed redness, swelling , and warmth at the injection site. Symptoms were not present prior to the morning of January 15th. The area of the injection felt hard underneath the skin. I was evaluated by a physician and treated for cellulitis with antibiotics. Symptoms resolved with antibiotic course.

Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

                                                The day of the injection I had a very sore arm, just like my first dose. Then around quarter after midnight, I got up to use the bathroom. I recall extremely vivid dreams, and a little bit of disorientation. On my way back to bed I thought I?d take another ibuprofen to help me sleep because my arm was so sore. I remember feeling very dizzy, I did take my pill, and then I woke up on the floor. I was extremely disoriented and there was a shrill ringing in my left ear. As I came to, I recall really finding relief in the cold tile, and being concerned that I may have hit my head. I did a mental scan of my body and nothing felt painful, though stiff and sore, as I had the flu. I got back in bed and looked at the time, about 20 minutes had elapsed. The rest of the night I tossed turned, and felt quite feverish. I attempted to find radial and carotid pulses, which were extremely weak. That night, I  never did get a temperature, because I was quite disoriented. This morning I?ve been quite stiff and low energy. I feel discomfort in my kidneys, and have taken care to stay hydrated. I have reduced appetite, and some achiness in my body. My temperature right now is 100 even. It?s almost 3 o?clock, so about 28 hours has elapsed. I did not seek further medical care, as I live alone and transportation i would be a hurdle. I also not super concerned, mostly I just want you all to document that I painted, as I have not found that to be listed as a common side effect for the Moderna vaccine. I did call up a friend who is a paramedic, and feel reassured by her two cents.

I grabbed an epinephrine injector and went to assist.  When I got close to pt she started to pass out.   911 was called and pt was administered a dose of epinephrine and she revived enough to speak coherently.  Shortly after emts arrived and took pt to hospital.

However, at the time, she did not say anything and went home after 30 minutes of observation. After the vaccine, her arm was first sore and a couple of days later, the soreness turned into an itching. The itch is local around injection site on left arm. Potential allergic reaction, lasting for days post injection.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

Squeezing sensation self-resolved after call. Paramedics arrived about 1 hr post-vaccination. BP 89/66. (Note my normal BP runs 90-110s/50s-70s.) HR 70s-90s. Pulse Ox high 90s. Paramedics not concerned that reaction was allergic, no rescue meds advised. I felt well enough to drive home despite persisting facial tingling and tight breathing. Allegra and albuterol taken upon arrival home, resolved breathing but not facial tingling. Facial tingling better but not resolved after about 24 hrs.

I woke up around 6 AM the following day and felt extremely fatigued. Around 6:30 AM I became nauseous and very lightheaded. I had to brace myself against a counter so I would not fall down and faint. I rested all day then around 1 PM I got up and fainted. I woke up a moment later and had an intense ringing in my ears for several minutes. I felt fatigued the rest of the day.

                                                Patient emailed Employee Health yesterday stating that on 2/8/2021 one hour after receiving her 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine she had to call 911 because she felt  short of breath, dizzy and had heart palpitations, she reports that since then she still has mild symptoms and she also has numb sensation on her arms, dry mouth and feels fainty.  On Sunday 2/22/2021 she went to ER again due to feeling short of breath and dizzy spells. Symptoms made her miss one day of work next day because she still had mild symptoms and was very tired.

                                                When I received my first dose  and second dose of the Moderna  Covid vaccine I experienced the feeling of contrast solution going through my body. I had a weird taste in my mouth and a weird smell and a warm tingling sensation all over my body that started 30-60 seconds after the vaccine and lasted roughly 15 minutes. I also had slight swelling under my right side of my tongue. I notified the vaccine emergency employee and was told that is weird but that none of my symptoms had ever been reported and there was nothing they could do.

                                                On my way home from getting the vaccine I started having facial tingling, cheeks flushed, then facial numbness, weird taste in mouth that then turned to numbness especially in gums of front top teeth, and numbness in throat.  I can still breathe and eat and drink and control all of my facial muscles.  Feels like when the drugs they give you for numbing during dental work are wearing off.   Today (one day after first dose vaccination) I continue to have numbness, but it?s not worse, but I?m noticing that other parts of my skin including my forearms and scalp, left shoulder and neck are also feeling slightly numb and tingly.

                                                On 3/2/21 I administered the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine to patient about 9:20am.  On her PCQF she indicated that she had allergies to milk, shrimp, wheat, almonds and sesame.  She informed me she had no issues with medications or vaccines.  About 936am she came to me saying her throat felt itchy.  I gave her 25mg of diphenhydramine.  A few minutes later she told me she felt her tongue swelling and I gave her another 25mg of diphenhydramine.  At that point she told me her tongue felt very itchy and swollen and I called 911.  EMS arrived 14 minutes later and checked her out.  Her vitals were okay and she declined going to the hospital.  Patient sat for another 30 minutes or so and symptoms seemed to improve.  Patient has an EpiPen at home and patient bought a bottle of diphenhydramine to bring home with her.  I advised patient if any symptoms arise after the diphenhydramine wears off to take another dose.  If things seem to be worse she may need to use her EpiPen or call EMS.

After leaving I had intense shaking that eventually went away after about 30min.

She reported feeling feverish and she was warm to the touch, but her temperature was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Her O2 was at 99%.

Patient then reported a sudden headache at 6:57pm. EMS arrived at 7:01pm. The patient left with EMS.

It was swollen for a few hours until I remembered to take allergy medicine.  It subsided. Then today, January 19, 2021, it happened again.  It didn&#39;t swell as much, but was extremely itchy. My neck area and stomach area is itchy as well.

I couldn&#39;t swallow, couldn&#39;t feel my lips. I went back to where I received the vaccine and was given Benadryl. I waited 30 min and my throat closed again. I was given more Benadryl and I had to wait again. I eventually went home and slept the rest of the day. I woke up feeling like  I was hit by a bus. I was sweating with chills for two days.  I slowly got better. The muscle ache took longer to go away and I was eventually able to return to work on Monday. I was having problems with my throat. The allergy specialist had me doing breathing exercises and it eventually got better.

I had a bad rush where I felt like I was about to throw up, I had a migraine and very flush. I started vomiting. My arms started to hurt. I got hives again and they gave me two more Benadryl. They monitored me for another 30 minutes. They said I got super pale. They tried to give me ginger ale and crackers, but my stomach wouldn&#39;t allow it. They monitored me for a while longer and I felt better. I went home and woke up the next morning feeling terrible. Vomiting, swelling, muscle aches. I was in bed the whole time and I missed 4 days of work. I went back Tues 19th.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

I&#39;m also having nightmares and seeing shadows.

                                                I began having mild, localized left axilla pain and anterior shoulder joint pain at 24 hours post injection.   Over the next 24 hours (ie 48 hours post injection) the symptoms progressed to severe sharp, stabbing pain radiating to the left lateral neck along the jaw line, left anterior shoulder, left chest wall and along the left ribcage approximately T2/3 down to T9/10.  Also experienced gnawing-type stomach pain with some nausea at this time.  At the height of symptoms (approx 36 hours post injection), pain level was 9/10 and described as knifelike, sharp, and stabbing.  It was exacerbated by movement, particularly cough, sneeze, and hiccup.  Relieving factors included heat to the ice, but mild relief.  Pain levels began to diminish between hours 48 and 72 post-injection. By 72 hours post injection the jaw and left neck pain had resolved.  The left anterior shoulder/axilla and chest wall pain persisted, but severity had reduced from 9/10 to 4-5/10.  At 96 hours post injection severity had diminished to 2/10 with pain only at the left chest wall approximately T4/5 down to T9/10.  I am now 3.5 days out from injection and have pain level of 1/10 to the left chest wall with hiccup, sneeze, cough, and deep breath.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Vaccine given at 2040 and waited 15 minutes before leaving site. On my drive home, between 2100-2110 started feeling tingly and numb around mouth and it spread to entire face. Tongue and inside of cheeks also felt tingly/numb.  No visual swelling of face and breathing was ok. I didn&#39;t feel any airway obstruction.  Heart rate also increased. I continued driving to the nearest store to get Benadryl (about an additional 20-25 minutes).  Took 50mg at approximately 2145 and my symptoms slowly got better. As of today (02/16/2021) my face does not still feel 100% back to normal, very minimal numbness/tingly but more so on the left side which was also the same side as injection. I have had no facial drooping.

                                                pt stated that instantaneously after getting the covid vax she got a metal taste in side of her mouth and her tongue felt funny.  She had a tingling inside her mouth behind her teeth.  She was administered Benadryl.  She then got a tingling inside of the throat that moved down into her chest.  First Response team  was called.  She was having SOB.  She was moved to the ER where she was given more Benadryl and prednisone.  After that she had tingling in her lips as they were warm and puffy.  She was released around noon.  About 1:00 PM the same day pt started having SOB and the same bad taste in her mouth along with all of the other symptoms.  She took another Benadryl at 1:54 PM.   At 3PM she was sleeping and woke with tingling and hotness in her lips.  She started coughing and having trouble catching her breath.  This symptoms went away and came back at 3:46 pm.  She then again developed the same symptoms all over again but this also included swelling in the back of the tongue.   She took another Benadryl at 6:28 PM and then again at 10:28. About 11PM she got these mouth symptoms again along w/ really itchy feet and back.  She woke up at 5:50 AM she felt fine. At 8:00 AM she woke up and had the strange metal taste in her mouth along with a strange feeling in it.   At 11AM she had mild episode of the SOB and coughing.  At 3:15 she still has this taste in her mouth along with the strange feeling.  Pt is waiting on a CB from her PCP.

As I was driving home at 3:50 pm I suddenly started to feel tingling in my lips and my throat felt swollen and my chest tight. I was halfway home and panicked so I went home and stayed put. My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

I went to my gynecologist , first thinking I may have a yeast infection but she did not see a rash and couldn&#39;t diagnose me. She told me that my pain was probably neurological. She took my blood and sent it to a lab for possible yeast infection and STDs. She prescribed me Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Diporopionate 1%. I went to my PCP on Wednesday because the burning intensified and I thought that I may have shingles. I have a stuffy nose and my sense of smell isn&#39;t very good right now. My PCP gave me a Covid test and told me that she can not test me for shingles because I do not have a rash. She did prescribed me Gabapentin 100mg . I am awaiting Covid test and Lab results

I then felt flush and my hands became clammy. After maybe 2 minutes these symptoms resolved, I never had any trouble breathing so I continued home and did not seek any medical attention. The whole time frame was about 5 to 10 minutes.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

It lasted for about 30 minutes. The symptoms subsided while sitting back in a chair and drinking 2.5 bottles of water. I was able to walk out and proceed with grocery shopping slowly. Have taken it easy the rest of the day but able to be upright. Now just fatigue, muscle aches, feeling cold, abnormal teeth and tongue sensation x 2 hrs). The rest of the symptoms just described continue this evening which i attribute to the covid vaccine.

I alerted the nurse and about another 3-5 minutes afterwards felt like a rising sensation up toward my ears. It almost felt like I was being filled with something but could still breathe. I start to have a fast heartbeat and felt like I was sweating. I received Benadryl (IM) and felt relief about 1-2 minutes. After about 7-10 minutes I felt like it was coming back and the feeling rising back to my ears. I received another dose of Benadryl. I went home and made sure I continued the Benadryl  for 24 hours. My throat appeared swollen from the outside of my neck when I woke up from a nap about 3-4 hours after receiving the vaccine shot. My chest did have a little redness like hives but not full blown. Just red and irritated. The next morning my voice was very hoarse for a day and a half.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                MODERATE PAIN (6/10) AT INJECTION SITE began within 30 minutes of vaccine administration. Ibuprofen provided no pain relief, taken once 4 hours post-vaccine administration, and again 8 hours after. 24 hours after initial injection given, at work (I am a medical student rotating in neurology at the clinical site where the vaccine was administered), I felt severe pain at injection site (10/10), radiating toward my left shoulder blade. The pain was so severe, I could not continue my work. I applied an ice pack to my arm and took Ibuprofen, sat on the floor in the dark to wait for relief. I felt my heart racing, hyperventilating (likely due to pain), became diaphoretic, and experienced photophobia as well as tremulous shaking. After approximately 30 minutes, a supervisor found me and alerted emergency med techs on staff, who measured vitals and rushed me to the Emergency Department of our hospital. The pain began to subside to 5/10 after an hour in the ED, where I was treated with intravenous fluid (NS), diphenhydramine PO, and metoclopramide PO. I was stabilized, pain under control (3/10), and released approximately 3 hours after admission, at 3:15 PM.

                                                I had no immediate symptoms other than slight redness and muscular pain at injection site for a couple days, which was tolerable. 8 days after my vaccine (1/14/21) I noticed tightness in my right cheek and my tongue feeling a little numb or burnt in the evening while relaxing watching tv.  The next morning (1/15/21) when I woke up, the right side of my face was drooping.  It was mild at the time, but I was worried I was having a stroke, called my doctor and she felt comfortable having me come for an office appointment.  At my appointment, she diagnosed me with Bell&#39;s palsy and did 3 blood tests and had me get a head CT.  Results for all were unremarkable. I am 14 days out from when symptoms started and still dealing with Bell&#39;s palsy.  I did start a round of oral steroids on 1/19/21 and will finish those in the next 3 days.  I did not start any antivirals or any other treatments.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

My vison started to gray out,  my arms were tingling and my ears were ringing.  That lasted for a few minutes, it slowly got worse to the point where I thought I was going to faint, then slowly got better.  I spoke to my midwife about this, I was unsure if it was the vaccine or the pregnancy.  I&#39;ve never had this happen before. My midwife thought it was a Blood drop from eating then standing up right away.

Swelling caused moderate pain and mild difficulty swallowing with mild breathing obstruction/discomfort. Onset of symptoms was roughly 10-12 hours post Moderna injection #1. Symptoms abated somewhat with Benadryl and NSAIDs. Raspy voice, pain in neck/chin jaw from swelling, visible swelling of lymph nodes and discomfort (somewhat positional) when breathing, swallowing, speaking. Night #1 was severe. I may have gone to the ER if I was not so immunocompromised. Day 2 was uncomfortable/painful but better with NSAID use. Night 2 had increased swelling and pain that improved after taking Benadryl and Singulair and nightly dose of Celebrex. Day 3, I am a bit uncomfortable with mild pain and visible swelling, but improved from Day 2.

                                                6 minutes after receiving vaccine patient reported that her tongue was starting to swell and that her heart was racing.  Staff called 911 immediately.  Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

Due date is 3/11/2021 but will be induced on 3/4/2021 because I am 36, no other underlying health conditions. Allergic to Cipro and Sulfa medications. Currently taking prenatal and 50 mg of Zoloft. Waited the 15 mins and felt fine; driving home about 30-40 minus after vaccine, swallowing felt difficult and tongue began to swell slightly. I went to my primary care; they said my throat looked clear but tongue was slightly swollen. I was given Tylenol extra strength (2 pills) and 25 mg injection of Benadryl in the left arm.  Encouraged to still get the second dose and take Benadryl prior the vaccine as well as go to the primary office to be observed after the shot.

                                                I waited a full 30 min after my injection due to my peanut allergy.  Left hospital feeling ok- on drive home began to feel flushed in my face, tingling in my lips and began to wheeze.  It felt like my peanut allergy but on a smaller scale.  I took my Albuterol inhaler and some Benadryl once I got home and felt better.  The next day I still have some itchiness and  fullness in my throat but nothing like yesterday.

                                                Patient is an employee at Health Center. She was given the vaccine approx 3:30 pm on 1/28/2021 in the left deltoid. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine without incident. The following is a written statement from patient describing events: &#34;About 30 minutes after vaccine, I felt like I had hit my elbow on something. Discomfort radiated from left elbow to wrist- I did have pain around injection site. About 8:30pm on 1/8/21, area around injection site became more painful. Gradually pain increased radiating down to finger tips and up to left side of neck, stopped right below ear. Neck and shoulder muscles felt really tight- uncomfortable ache. Also got extremely tired- left side of face felt numb- left eye slightly blurry- I fell asleep about 10pm. Woke up a few hours later drenched in sweat. Face numbness gone, eyesight normal.? Patient reports the following day 1/9/2021 @ 2pm: ?All of a sudden I started to sweat all over. I didn?t feel hot, only last about 30 minutes.? Patient reports on Sunday 1/10/2021: ?Woke up feeling okay. Left arm and neck still ached but not as bad. Got fatigued around 10am. I got a headache that became really bad. Dizzy, nauseous- no relief from OTC meds. Headache went away after a few hours.? Patient reports today 1/11/2021: ?Today I am still very tired. My left arm, fingertips, shoulders and neck still ache. Face is flushed.? Patient does state previous reactions to prior vaccines: ?TdaP about 7 years ago made me have joint pain for months. Last flu shot received was about 9 years ago, had flu like symptoms x12 hours.? Patient did not seek any medical care for the reaction described above. Patient?s PCP has been also been made aware of her reaction.

All symptoms resolved in about 15 minutes with the exception of  numbness/tingling to tongue and lips which lasted 3 hours. Symptoms resolved on their own without treatment/medication other than lying flat with feet up and drinking a bottle of water. I was assessed by medical professionals at the vaccine clinic which was located inside of the hospital. I consulted with an ED physician but did not require any additional treatment.

The back of my tongue became very dry.   I felt better after 10 minutes and never passed out.  They took my vital signs and everything was normal.  I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

Day 3---no side effects Day 4 to Day 5---At about 8 pm, I noticed slight swelling underneath my left eye, that looked like a bag.  My face was also red.  The sides of my face, jaw line,  &amp; both sides of my neck were itchy.  I went to bed since I was supposed to work the next morning at 6 AM (OB Nurse).  I work up at 4:15 AM &amp; my face was quite swollen, specifically my left side, my face &amp; neck was warm to the touch &amp;  itchy.  I immediately took 50mg of Benadryl &amp; called my internal medicine doctor. Day 5---I was to be seen in the clinic at 7:00 AM.  The Benadryl helped some.  I was not having any breathing difficulty.  I was prescribed 5 days of Prednisone.  By about 1:00 PM,  the swelling was worsening &amp; my lips were tingling.  I called the doctor again &amp; they told me to go to the ER.  I never had issues with my airway.   The swelling was always worse on my left side of my face.  I received IV fluids &amp; Solumedrol &amp; was discharged with an epi pen, &amp; told to continue the Benadryl, Prednisone, &amp; Pepcid bid.  CoVid test done in ER was negative. Day 6---The facial swelling/redness/itching remained but was improved.  I was very tired. Day 7---Same as Day 6, but less swelling. Day 8---Facial swelling/redness/itching gone, but tiredness remained.  Started to notice a chest heaviness/feeling of constant excitement in the center of my chest, even when at rest. Day 9-10---Tiredness remained.  Intermittent Chest heaviness/feeling of excitement in the center of my chest remained. Day 11---Feeling more normal.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the injection, I developed a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt a bit light-headed and woozy. I informed the staff at the site that I felt this way and they asked me to remain for additional monitoring. Over the next 15 minutes, my tongue began to swell. 15 minutes later my jaw began to stiffen and I had difficulty swallowing. After another 15 minutes the staff asked the EMS personnel to screen me and check my vitals. All were normal. After another 30 minutes of monitoring by EMS the symptoms began to subside and I went home.   At home, I began to feel weak and went to bed. My body began to ache and I took ibuprofen to ease the pain. Within 15 hours of receiving the dose, I had a 100.9-degree fever and chills. The fever lasted the next day. I could not get out of bed for the next day. When I tried to sit up and watch TV I had back pain so severe it left me in tears.  I went back to bed and stayed there until the following morning. All told, I could not get out of bed for 36 hours.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

                                                20 hours post vaccination (dose 1 of the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine), I woke up feeling soreness in my left arm which is the injection site. I started feeling dizzy, a buzzing in my ears and broke into a sweat. I tried to stand up and walk over to my bed, but lost my balance and collapsed for about 5 seconds. Once I regained consciousness I stopped sweating, rested for a bit and then was able to resume normal function (drinking water, coffee, something sugary).

                                                Moderna Vaccine. No immediate reaction. 1/13/21 I noticed there was still a sizable lump at the injection site. Called our Employee Health hotline and they advised to apply heat and massage the area. 1/14/21, I applied heat and massaged the area and within a few hours the injection site started to get red and increase in size, and my eyes began to itch and swell. Took a Benadryl and in the morning there was more swelling in my face. Went to the dr, they couldn&#39;t confirm if was or wasn&#39;t vaccine related, and advised to continue taking Benadryl and apply cool compress if arm was painful. Swelling continued on 1/15 and 1/16. Arm still has a large spot, it is less red in color now, there is still slight heat at the injection site. I have been taking at least 1 Benadryl for the last 7 days now.

                                                My cheeks and upper lip became swollen hours after having the vaccine. I had no other signs of an allergic reaction. In the past, I have had similar, but more severe, facial swelling that from antibiotics containing sulfonamide and fenugreek tea that also did not progress past facial swelling. I took Benadryl (two capsules). The swelling did not progress. They did have me wait 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine due to my history of allergic reactions to other things and nothing occurred during that time frame.  My cheeks and lip are still  very slightly swollen and I plan to take a second dose of Benadryl to make sure it completely dissipates.

The nurses on staff said that several other people had reported the same. Within about 30-40 minutes after leaving the clinic, I also had bilateral facial numbness and tingling lips. The arm and facial numbness lasted for about 5 hours and lessened right before I went to bed and this morning only my arm hurts (normal vaccine site pain).

Went ER at 12:55 pm and they did an EKG - not a regular heartbeat; blood work and x-ray. My BP was high - 143/122; I had low potassium; white blood cells higher than normal -10.9 (in mid Nov - only 7.5); They gave me potassium to take. December 30, when I got home at 6:30 - nausea started and I was throwing up two-three  days in a row more than 5 or 6 times a day; weird metallic taste; fever at night; arm pain and swollen under my armpits. (Stayed off work three days.) Went to dr on Jan. 7 - did a follow up appt. and did all the blood work again and everything was back to normal.

                                                I got the vaccine on 30th of Dec. Had a sore arm, runny nose, woke up the next day to puffy eyes and bruises under my eyes (still hasn&#39;t gone away) Since then I have had GI issues. Constipation. It aggravated my face. I had nausea. I had a rash on my arm and on my chest the following Tuesday. My face were tingling and very flush. I had a lot of allergy and sinus issues. Sinus pressure. This all unfolded the first few weeks after receiving the vaccine. I do have fibromyalgia. I had allergy testing done. I am allergic to bee stings. Was having a lot of vaginal issues. Watery eyes and have hot flashes followed by chills. Hives on chest. Difficulty swallowing. Rapid heart rate. I have seen three doctors that have told me my hear rate was fast. Glands have been swollen for two weeks. The night after I got the shot it was really rough with body aches.

Reported that her ear to my chin went numb and my lips and tongue were tingling and it lasted hours!!! It felt like my Bell?s palsy came back.  She reached out to her PCP to ask about whether or not she should get her 2nd vaccine - worried about Bell&#39;s Palsy recurring or worsening tongue swelling/tingling.

She stated the following symptoms came on &#34;Like a wave&#34;: Dizziness, light headedness, ears ringing, sound pulsing, and her vision began to go black. She described the field of vision closing like that of a loony toons show ending (coming from the outside in).   Patient was found to have her eyes closed, hyperventilating at a rate of 28 breaths per minute. Ice pack placed on her neck. She was coached to slow her breathing, instructed to hold her breath for 10 seconds, then to release it slowly. She did this for 3 minutes. She related her body felt tingly all over. Encouraged patient to continue the slow breathing. As patient began to feel better, she related that she has a known needle phobia. She expressed that she becomes anxious even when she is not the one receiving a shot, and this fear stems from a traumatic experience of her son having a seizure after a shot. She works at a school and when they do first aid training and cover the diabetes section, the pictures of needles make her anxious. Patient provided with therapeutic communication, encouraged to discuss fears with her counselor. Patient remained seated in clinic until she felt well enough for her husband to drive her home.

                                                Shortly after my vaccine, I experienced a copper taste in my mouth, felt dizzy and I indicated to a paramedic that I was not feeling well. I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

The vertigo symptoms subsided after 2-3 days and treatment in the emergency room however the tinnitus has become permanent in my left ear for over 3 weeks now. It is loud enough to disrupt my sleeping and my ability to hear from my left ear. I still have slight dizziness spells intermittently. Additionally, I have begun to experience extreme arthritis and muscular pain throughout my body, which begun 2 weeks after the 2nd dose. I have begun to lose function intermittently of my feet, fingers, and arms at different times throughout the day.

Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

                                                Just about 15 mins after recieving vaccination, I  experienced increased shortness of breath, feeling weak, slight headache, and my heart seemed to race.  When I shared this with the pharmasist, she did not offer to take vitals nor seemed concerned.  She suggested that I was experiencing anxiety, and that it was not a typical reaction to the vaccine.  However, each day since vaccine I have continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.  Today, 3 days after the vaccine, I had more shortness of breath than I had since first contracting Covid-19(which was on 10th of Dec).  I also was having to stop walking several times every 5 mins or so in order to catch my breath, feeling weakness and fatigue.  My sense or taste/smell is gone as well. I was so short of breath today, work was worried anough about me they urged me to go home and call my doctor.  I now have a tele-visit set up with my doctor today.

                                                The next morning (12/29/20) - I had typical symptoms -- &gt; minimal body aches/fatigue and a sore Left arm  At 6pm (12/29/20) -- &gt; I just finished dinner and all of sudden I felt like I zoned out/passed out for a minute.  When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

                                                Six days after, I started being  awakened by the pain of my lips swelling to 3xs their size, tongue slightly swollen and throat possibly.  I took a Benedryl or Claritin and Advil.  Eight  hours after the 1st vaccine, I experienced severe aches and pain, fatigue lasting almost 72hrs. Even the joints of fingers aches but the pain in my lymph node in my left armpit felt like someone hit me with a baseball bat (injection was in left arm).

Over next 15 min started feeling nauseated, lips started to tingle, mouth and tongue felt heavy and I had to try harder to enunciate words. Went to ED and received prednisone. Tongue was a little swollen at this point. Airway was regularly checked and did not close.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 10 minutes after receiving vaccine throat began tingling and I noticed my heart rate was 164 on my apple watch.  Notified nursed overseeing the monitoring.  Nurses began hooking my up to monitoring equipment. Heart rate came down to 120.  Nurses noticed flushing in face and blotchiness on arms. After an additional 15 minutes of monitoring, flushing was still present as well as throat tingling (just tingling, no swelling), so nurses sent me to the ER for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to ER temperature was 100.2 F. (Temperature before vaccine was 97 F, no fevers recorded after ER visit).  In ER fluids and zofran were given and was released after two hours of monitoring.  In the evening I experienced moderate pain in the left arm (very painful to lift arm above shoulder level) that lasted about 24 hours.  I also had a mild to moderate headache that lasted about 24 hours, beginning the evening of the vaccine.   I also experienced mild to moderate nausea that began the day of the vaccine (Saturday, 12/26) and was on and off through Wednesday, 12/30.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

                                                I ended up with Covid after the Moderna vaccine.  I experienced low grade fever and joint and muscle aches, chills, feeling really flu-like symptoms. I had alot of congestion as well and eventually lost my taste and smell.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

                                                Initially in first hour- head spacey , lightheaded, left temple headache , scratchy throat dry mouth. Then nothing   Day 5 today I started feeling like I had a bruise in my armpit region on the chest wall side (where your armpit fat is but deep). It feels like a lymph node . Basically it feels like a bruise when I flex my bicep it hurts there or when my arm is relaxed at my side the pressure hurts in the armpit. It is not superficial .

                                                Approximately 10 hrs after the vaccine, I woke up very thirsty. When I went to get water, my brain and body felt disjointed. My brain was telling me to walk forward and my legs were stumbling all over as I tried to walk. I went back to sleep and woke up hours later more stable but still with my head feeling very light(not quite dizzy). I was slightly nauseous and just blah most of the next day. I?d get slightly out of breath when talking for awhile. I was in a deep fog. To the point it took a few minute to process the sound my dog made with it coming from him. Overall, I felt like I was drugged or really intoxicated. I worry about my 2nd dose!

                                                About 5 hours after the vaccine, I started feeling really hot especially in head and face. From there, I had fever and it started going up. Body aches; joint pain; headache; and this went on all throughout that night (Jan 2 and morning of the 3rd). The 3rd, my fever wasn&#39;t as high but I still had fever and felt really really tired and body aches/joint pain. On the 4th, when I woke up I noticed that I didn&#39;t have any taste and smell and so I went in and got tested for COVID 19 (the 4th) - positive for COVID-19.  I went to a clinic that could do a Rapid test. Doctor there gave me Azithromyocin - 2 the first day and one every day after; Dexamethasone once  a day for 10 days.  I could  Tylenol and Motrin (alternating because my fever wouldn&#39;t go down). The highest my fever got was that Saturday night got up to 103 degrees. The last day I had fever was the 5th of January and that was 99.8. Jan 7, 8, and 9th -  I continued to have other symptoms like really severe headache; no appetite; felt super tired and could hardly get out of bed. Those symptoms resolved about the 10th of Jan -  headache almost went away and fatigue was still there and it is still there. I got out of quarantine on the 15th and I went back to work on the 18th - I had no fever. I just felt tired. I couldn&#39;t sleep - throughout. I finally started being able to sleep just a couple of days ago. I had the second dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 30th - I had fever again; body aches; joint pain.

                                                8 mins after the shot my throat started burning, heart pounding, shaking uncontrollably, throat felt like it was sticking together, dizzy, lost all my color, hives, tunnel vision, kept almost passing out. Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

                                                I received the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 01:49 pm. Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for a health checker and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on a health checker under ?other&#39;&#39; multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud&#39;s Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series. On 2/3/2021 at approximately 1:45 pm, I received the second Moderna Covid-19 vaccination.  On 2//10/2021, small red, itchy bumps started to appear on both sides of my neck. On 2/15/2021, a bump appeared above my right eyebrow with what felt like a pimple. On 2/21/2021, the ?pimple? had spread towards my inner eye and above my right eyebrow making my right eyelid swell. I received telemedicine care via an e-visit over telehealth with an urgent care and was provided an antibiotic for facial cellulitis. On 2/22/2021, I had one episode of emesis, and went in person to an urgent care. I received a different prescription of an antibiotic, and was provided with instructions of signs and symptoms of what to look for when to report to the emergency room. On 2/25/2021, my right eye started tearing up and the pain began to intensify. I was provided medical care by a Neuro-ophthalmologist and given a primary diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Presently, I have multiple areas of herpes zoster appearing on various areas of my head, shoulder, and chest that do not follow specific dermatomes.

                                                Received vaccine Thursday afternoon. Waited for a half hour after receiving the vaccine, as there is a history of anaphylaxis. On the drive home lips began to swell and the lips felt numb. Patient went home and took some Benadryl which seemed to help.  Friday 3/5  Patient woke and her arm was swollen at the injection site and was very painful. Patient also complained of a headache at that time. Later that same day, Patient developed a rash at the injection site and intense itching all over her body including her face. Patient went to the Medical Center ER. At ER the staff evaluated her and administered IV steroids and Benadryl and sent her home with instructions to return in worsens. Saturday Patient complained that her throat began swelling and so she went back to the ER. The  ER gave more IV steroids and Benadryl, a breathing treatment (nebulizer), and gave 2 doses of epinephrine. Due to Patient&#39;s continued symptoms and gradual worsening condition the medical provider at ER felt  it necessary for Patient to be admitted, however, due to the smaller size and limited resources at ER it was decided for Patient to be transported to Hospital. Patient has remained admitted at Hospital since then, and yesterday (Sunday) she required another dose of epinephrine due to tongue swelling.  Patient reports that she is being given IV Benadryl and steroids, and she will not be discharged today. Today Patient is also reporting a burning sensation with urination.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                Within 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I started getting a tingling sensation in my lips and cheeks. It lasted approximately one hour. Felt tired the rest of the day. I awoke at around 2am the next morning with diarrhea, extreme chills and bodyaches, and a headache. My right arm was very sore, but I expected that. I went back to bed and awoke for work at 6am. My injection site was red, puffy, and heat to the touch. My body ached as if I had a bad case of the flu. The next morning, I awoke with nausea and vomiting. It lasted until around 9am.  The aches have eased up, but I remain very tired and my injection site is still very red, puffy, and warm to the touch. It feels as if there are knots under the skin.

Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

IN THE NIGHT TIME AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL I HAD NIGHT SWEATS AND A HIGH FEVER THROUGH THE NIGHT.  I WAS GIVEN  BENEDRYL 50 ML BY INJECTION AT THE HD AND  DEXAMETHASONE  INJECTION AT THE HOSPITAL AND SEND HOME WITH A STEROID PRESCRIPTION FOR PEPCID  THAT LASTED 7 DAYS.  ALONG WITH THE INSTRUCTION TO CONTINUE TAKING BENEDRYL UNTIL THE HIVES STOPPED COMING BACK AFTER THE SHOT WAS OUT OF MY SYSTEM.  i TOOK THE MEDICATION FOR 5 DAYS UNTIL THE HIVES STOPPED RELAPSING.   2 WEEKS LATER I AM FEELING FINE  BUT DO NOT THINK I WILL BE TAKING THE SECOND DOSE DUE TO THE ALLERGY.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine I began to experience shortness of breath and chest tightness.  Within 20 minutes I was experiencing further shortness of breath, shakiness, and lip numbness and swelling. I received the vaccine through my workplace.  I called the employee health line who recommended that I stay with someone else until the symptoms resolved and for not less than an hour.  It took 2 hours for symptoms to resolve.  I also followed up with my primary care regarding my reaction.

                                                Legs extremely weak and felt like muscles were not functioning well. Knees were buckling while standing. Started about 4 hours after vaccination. Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine last Thursday (1/14/21) at clinic and had a pretty severe reaction within a few minutes of the receiving the vaccine. I didn?t alert anyone because I wasn?t sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. I felt hot suddenly, then very dizzy/faint, then experienced very bad tinnitus and couldn?t hear any of the words being spoken around me, just muffled sounds. I felt slightly nauseous, was seeing spots, and felt very close to fainting. My pulse was racing. I did deep breathing  until it subsided (which was about 10 minutes later). For the next 5 days after the vaccine, I experience extreme soreness and weakness in the left arm where the injection was given. I also had redness and itching and it was hot to the touch and slightly swollen. I had extreme fatigue and a headache and a loss of appetite. After 5 days, those subsided. 1 week after the vaccine (01/21/21),  I experienced intense itching at the injection site and redness and it was hot to the touch. I also experienced intense itching on my chin and skin numbness in that area of my chin. The chin area resolved after about 4 hours. The arm itching did not resolved. i woke up on 01/22/21 with the entire left shoulder area swollen, red, hot to the touch, and extremely itchy. it lasted all day. I woke up on 01/23/21 and the swelling had gone down, but the redness spread to a larger area on the upper left arm and the itching persisted all day. I woke up on 01/24/21 and the redness and swelling was almost gone but the itching was still there and the area that had swollen up felt very bruised, but no visible bruising. Today (01/25/21) there is no more itching or redness but the bruised sensation continues.

I had a rash around site that progressed up to the right side of my face and also right side of my lower back the following day. The rash was also accompanied by blotches and is still there only on the side of the injection. I had metallic taste for on and off the first 2-3 days. I am feeling a bit better, well enough to work today. Still very fatigued. On Thursday I also had a 102 fever that Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help me at all at night. I finally stopped sweating yesterday. The blotches are now improving . Only thing that remains is the fatigue.

My lips were getting numb. I was confused and unable to participate in a work phone call I answered.  12:45 I began driving as I felt a little better. Drove 2 miles and pulled over to park and wait it out. Heart still racing, hives still present, chest pains still there and could not inhale deeply.  12:50 I drove the rest of the way home. I took a double dose of liquid Benadryl and laid down waiting for symptoms to pass. They slowly resolved over the next 6 hours.  It is now 1/30/21 and I still feel like crap, but not allergy wise. More like the flu.

                                                The next two days I had a sore arm. But a week later, the following Monday and Tuesday, I had fatigue and headaches. I put the date as Wednesday because that is when the concerning possible reactions began. I woke with clogged ears feeling very sick. I took Advil Cold and Sinus and arranged to miss work. It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected. My ankles were also very tender as I had done a little jogging the day before and I normally walk. As the day progressed I was barely able to get out of bed. Sleeping and just laying there. My highest temperature was 101.25 at 2:45 pm. I had severe chills on and off. I reported these afflictions and was mailed a covid test by Thursday. The test came back negative by Friday evening. Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm. The oddness of that being where my shot was given is what makes me wonder if it was an extreme reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it is a flu. I have never had the body pains I try to describe before.

She did report that she had a latex allergy so I removed the band aid even though the band aides are labeled latex-free. I checked her vitals and  Her b/p was 114/85 pulse was 84 and respirations 16. Her pulse ox was 95% She was in no apparent distress. The blurred vision resolved in 5 minutes and her vitals remained stable for 30 minutes. I discharged her with no symptoms.

                                                Day 1: 7 hours after the vaccine shot, I experienced mild fatigue and chills. Overnight, I had night sweats and insomnia. (Night sweats are a symptom that started after the first vaccine shot, and had dwindled until the second brought them up again).   Day 2: The next morning, I experienced intense fatigue, dizziness, chills, fever, headache with light and sound sensitivity, nausea, and intense fatigue. I was unable to get out of bed most of the day. I could not sit up without intense effort to even drink water. At approximately 11am, I took 600mg Tylenol, then was able to sleep for 3 hours. When I woke up my symptoms were much better, though I still had mild fatigue and achiness.   Day 3:  I was mildly fatigued but otherwise felt good.   Day 4: I awoke with a series of small rashes on my torso (front, back, and sides), as well as my inner arm. They were red, flat, not raised, and mildly itchy, One was around my umbilicus, a few under my breasts, and other splotched in random other places on my torso. My inner ears were also mildly itchy. I put generic rash cream on the rashes on my torso and arms, and the itchiness subsided. The redness decreased throughout the day, though they were all still visible by evening.    Day 5: I awoke and my entire torso was bright red *except* the places where the rashes had been the day before, which were normal skin color. Ears are itchy again, and skin is very mildly itchy. Other than that, no other symptoms. No trouble breathing, good energy.   I have never had rashes or an allergic reaction like this before. I assume it&#39;s an allergic reaction, due to the itchy inner ears and skin.

My breast milk while I was sick with flu like symptoms from the vaccine changed to a chemical taste and it burnt my throat. I tasted it only because my baby was crying every time I was trying to feed her. The vile taste was in all of my breast milk while I was sick until my symptoms resolved 24 hours later. As I got better the taste was less noticeable. I wish I had kept the milk to be tested but ended up discarding all of it.

                                                Event: Allergic reaction on 3/24. The injection site began to itch around 9:30pm after taking a hot shower. Approximately 10 minutes later the injection site area swelled and became &#34;hard&#34; to the touch, then turn red, hot, and tender to the touch. The area affected was approximately 3 inches wide and 4 inches long - it covered the upper arm (deltoid muscle area). Within 5 minutes the itching sensation spread over the upper back on the left side and to the left side of my neck. Approximately 20 minutes later my bottom lip on the left-hand side swelled slightly and turned red and I had a slight difficulty swallowing. My breathing was not impeded. The reaction did not progress further (I had taken allergy medication to stop any further reaction). By 11pm the difficulty swallowing disappeared and the swelling in my lip reduced. By 5:30am I had no trouble with swallowing and there was no facial swelling. The swelling in my arm was reduced by half - although it was still warm, sensitive, and itched. Throughout the day (on 3/25) the swelling and redness at the injection site reduced. Two days after the start of the event, the area is still warm to the touch and will itch on occasion as will my lower left lip.  Treatment: as soon as I recognized it was an allergic reaction, when the area swelled, I took half a Wal-Zyr 10mg tablet (so I took 5mg of Walgreen&#39;s generic brand of Zyrtec) - approximately 9:45pm on 3/24. I took the other half (5mg) of the tablet at 5:30am the next morning on 3/25. No additional medication has been taken since.  Outcomes: The reaction was managed with the Wal-Zyr medication. Currently the injection area is slightly warm and itches on occasion, as does my lower left lip. There has been no change in this condition in the past 20 hours.

At 12:07 she  (she is an RN employee here at the hospital) reported feeling as if she had lump in her throat and asked for some benadryl.  Rapid response team was called at 12:08 as she became diaphoretic, flushed and reported blurred vision. MD ordered an IV to be started and a NS bolus x 1 liter.   She broke out in hives on bilateral upper extremities.   Benadryl, solumedrol, albuterol inhaler, zofran, scopolamine patch were all ordered and given to the patient. She reported that she felt some better and was transferred to the ER at 1245 for further monitoring.

                                                40 minutes after injection my tongue and throat began to swell and then close.  I had no saliva and could not swallow without sipping on water.  I stopped at a clinic to be near a facility in case I could not breath anymore.  They watched me for a bit (though I did not fully &#34;check in&#34;.  The doctor suggested I get checked at an ER.  I went to ER and sat in the ER parking lot for two hours waiting to see if my symptoms got worse.  I did not want to use the ER unless I felt like I was in dire need.  After the couple of hours my symptoms weekend (but were still there).  I went to a friends place to not be alone in case the swelling increased again.  The next night I felt back to normal.  I have never had that reaction to anything, so I was a bit scared.

I was still waiting for the nurse to replace her bandaid since she was bleeding a little more than normal. As soon as the car got out of the tent, I was driving, it felt like my head was being drilled, my vision blurred, everything turned dark, I could not hear, I had a bad headache almost about to faint but I kept on driving slowly to get to the waiting area. By the time I parked, I removed my mask, open the car window and relaxed and just started inhaling deeply.  I felt better soon after and spoke to the nurse there and she recommended drinking fluids the next 48 hrs.  I felt dizzy,  tired but not very sore like the first dose.  2 days later, I still feel dizzy, vision is blurry sometimes and occasional headache, a little tenderness on abdomen and feeling like I am catching my breath sometimes.
