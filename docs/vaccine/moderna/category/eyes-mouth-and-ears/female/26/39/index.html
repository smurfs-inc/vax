I was talking to people that were not there. I felt completely out of control. The only thing that helped was forcing myself to focus on the TV, which was extremely difficult. Symptoms started to die down around 3 AM, but did not go away. I slept for 4 hours.  1/20 8 AM- felt like and still feel like I am not in reality, I feel disassociated with my body (like its not mine), slightly out of control of my thoughts, I see subtle black and white flashing like last night but not as intense, paranoia like last night/not as intense, cant concentrate.

                                                Got the vaccine on Feb 17, 2021 at 9am. On Feb 18 at around 8:30-9 pm, left cheek started feeling uncomfortable and a bit swollen. The next morning, swelling was extreme and extremely painful to touch. It was difficult to eat from left side and to laugh and talk. Also, had chills and felt weak.  I scheduled an online appointment with Dr.  he mentioned the condition is called acute pericoronitis and he suggested that vaccine might have increased the immune response to any infection that might have happened underneath the left wisdom teeth which hasn&#39;t come out yet. [Note: Same response had happened when I got my MMR vaccine on Feb. 1, 2021]. He prescribed Amoxicillin 500mg for a week.  As of Feb 22. 11 pm, after taking Amoxicillin and ibuprofen, the swelling has bit reduced but the pain persists.

Maybe some mild left tongue swelling. Normal swallowing, normal breathing. No cough. No vomiting or diarrhea. No rash. She called an urgent care who recommended Benadryl, which helped minimize the tingling sensation and swelling over the next 2 days.

She was not sick when she received the vaccine. No new medications. Tolerates NSAIDs normally without reaction. No facial fillers. Never had anaphylaxis before to anything -- foods, medications, injectables, other vaccines. No known PEG allergy. Has not used Miralax before.

                                                &#34;I received my first dose of the covid vaccine yesterday, January 4th around 3pm. I have not felt any major symptoms or side effects aside from pain at the injection site. This afternoon I noticed how sore my arm was and started looking up potential side effects of the vaccine to see how long I should expect pain. I was trying to practice lifting my sore arm and then started feeling light headed. My vision went blurry, my hearing was muffled, and I started to feel like I was going to faint and/or vomit. I tried drinking water to see if that would help and when it didn&#39;t I called over to my coworker to tell her I felt like I was going to pass out. She informed our boss, who called Employee Health. They both walked me downstairs to Employee Health.&#34;

My throat was tingling ajd I had what is best described as ?on and off? rushes throughout my body. I returned back to the site where I got my test from and reported my reaction somewhere around 5:30. I was given 50 mg of Benadryl and told to have friends come and pick me up and drive me home. Around 8pm I was having slight tingling in my throat however it was mentioned it could be the after effect of the sensitivity to the vaccine. I was advised to not have the second dose.

                                                12/31 I had tingling in my throat and was observed in urgent care for two hours with no intervention. It went away by the time I went to bed that night. 1/8 I woke up with a sore arm, did not think much of it and went to work. It was sore all day and when I got home I undressed to take a shower and noticed that it was red, swollen and hot to the touch. I tried hot compresses as I suspected it was cellulitis and marked the borders. It had grown in size the nest morning (1/9) which is when I went back to urgent care and was prescribed 3 days of Keflex. The first dose reduced the swelling and pain in my arm, but by the end of the course of antibiotics it was still red 1/13 I went back to urgent care to be seen for the redness and tenderness. The NP suspected that it may be an immune reaction rather than cellulitis and gave me a single oral dose of decadron with instructions to follow up in 3-4 hours by sending in a picture, and if it did not get better to fill a longer prescription for Keflex. At this point I have taken the prescription to the pharmacy and am waiting until after work to pick it up and begin the script.

On 1/7/2021 I started to feel short of breath and run down. Sinus infection symptoms. I was sent home from work to get a COVID swab. That evening I lost my taste and began to feel achey. Negative test on 1/10/21. Saw urgent care on 1/9/21 for Covid swab and visit. He diagnosed viral and was sure I was positive. On 1/11/21 my energy returned and I wasn?t achey. Congestion and cough. By 1/13/21 felt fine other than lingering wet cough. This morning, 1/14/21 I noticed my arm itched and looked at it and I?ve got a small red rash around the injection sight and tenderness on palpation.

                                                The day of my first vaccination, I got a painful red lump at the injection site and it was warm to touch. Today is 1/20/21 and I&#39;m still experiencing the same reaction- it hasn&#39;t gone away,  the red lump is less swollen and warm to touch. I also experienced moderate fatigue and weakness, constant headache, and loss of smell and I&#39;m still experiencing these symptoms.

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

                                                I received the vaccination on 1/14 and started to get an itching sensation that night - nothing noticeably or concern and was able to go to sleep. The next morning I was very itchy and red and started to break out in hives that started to get worse and spread through my body. I took Benadryl throughout the day and at night to help my sleep. On Saturday morning my eyes were swollen and red, I had severe hives all over my body and had to go to the ER for some type of relief. This was immediately after I woke up, the right side of my body was extremely hot and I went to the restroom and looked in the mirror and didn&#39;t recognize myself. At the ER, they put me on Prednisone - to take 2 tablets for 3 days, Famotidine - taking 1 tab, 2 times a day for 5 days, and Benadryl, 1 tab, 3X a day until the symptoms subside - It is currently 1/19 and my skin will start to heat up, primarily in my hands and start to itch, but no more hives or anything severe.  I am currently pregnant with my first child, due date 7/7/2021. I have had no previous pregnancies, miscarriages, or abortions.

Sound became amplified and began to experience a migraine.  &#34;People talking low to me felt like they were screaming into my ear drums.&#34; Extreme fatigue so could barely keep eyes open.  Standing was difficult; moved to wheelchair. Most symptoms lasted 2 to 3 days.  Fever of 102 on first day only.  Fatigue for one week.  Right upper arm, not at the injection site, had a &#34;hive&#34; about the size of a nickel that has not gone away (as of 2/23/21).   New migraines with light sensitivity that affect ability to work also have not gone away (as of 2/23/21).

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

                                                I have been experiencing tinnitus and potential hearing lose in right ear. When I first noticed it, I had a numbness by my right ear which subsided but three weeks later, I still have a ringing in my ear which I have never had issues with my ears and I am nervous to get the second dose. There are multiple reports of this very thing on website and it is concerning.

The area around the injection site was swollen, red, and painful to touch. I fell over on my way to the toilet due to extreme dizziness. I had three hours of diarrhea, and then took pepto bismal and bennydryl. Those remedies worked and my symptoms subsided and I was able to fall back asleep by 4am. In the morning I felt normal, besides some remaining pain and redness surrounding the injection site.

My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

                                                Beginning Saturday morning, I began to experience hives, coming and going throughout the day. There were 2 significant episodes on Saturday, one Sunday morning, two throughout the day on Monday. Beginning Tuesday morning, I experienced hives that continued throughout the day. Starting around 1:00 pm, they moved from a more localized area on my upper trunk to covering my entire body, head to toe. I became hypotensive (lowest was 90/60), tachycardic (pulse rate ranging from 100-125), low grade temperature (100.4), noticed a tingling feeling in my lips, a new onset sore throat, and ringing in my ears. My pulse ox remained stable, no oxygen required. I took a claritin chewable approximately 10 minutes after onset of worsening symptoms, then 50 mg of benadryl 3 hours later.  I have continued to take 25 mg of benadryl BID since Tuesday and have remained without any new onset of hives. No medical admissions were required, although I do work in a medical clinic and close observation was available for me.  Only symptom remaining is fatigue, unsure if this is related to benadryl usage or remaining vaccine reaction.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

The wheezing resolved that night, and breathing improved. The next day patient was congested, had a cough and the tops of her feet were &#34;extremely itchy&#34;.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

I began to feel severe flu-like symptoms (hot/cold chills, sensitive skin, headache, dry/scratchy throat, fever dreams) which persisted for several hours during the night. The next day (1/16), the fatigue, headache, and chills persisted (although the chills decreased). I took Dayquil before noon and that seemed to help with the symptoms, and Nyquil at night so I was able to sleep. By the following morning, I still had a mild headache and fatigue but continued to improve. I felt normal again on 1/18.   I also had stiffness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site for 3-4 days.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

                                                About 8-10 minutes after the injection, my vision got blurry. It was very brief- only a couple minutes long. If it had lasted until the end of my 15 minute post-injection observation period, I would have reported it then, but it didn&#39;t. I decided to include it here, because later in the day, I had another reaction. About 12 hours after the dose -around 7PM- I started getting chills and body aches and abnormally fatigued. The chills were intense almost as soon as they come on. The body aches were mild for the first couple hours and progressed to intense. Both symptoms lasted continuously for about 12 hours, then around 7AM they started to wane. I&#39;m not sure if I should list insomnia as a reaction, but despite how exhausted I felt, I could not sleep. It could have also been just general discomfort that kept me from being able to sleep. Through most of the following day I had mild aches and waves of chills. By the time I went to bed that night (last night at the time of writing this), the symptoms had mostly  cleared and so far have not returned.

The reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% , 7 days after receiving the covid vaccine. I started to feel pain to left jaw but figured it was due to dental work. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek was very painful and hard. The pain to face was about 8/10. I iced it, took pain pill and fell asleep. When I woke up my left arm was hot itchy swollen and the arm and jaw were still very painful.    the reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% I started to feel pain to left jaw injection area. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek is painful and hard. By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. I&#39;m tearting it with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1%to deltoid  2-3 times a day.  By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s now 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. My left cheek jaw area is tender but I&#39;ll assume it&#39;s from the dental work. I&#39;m treating left arm  with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1% to deltoid  2-3 times a day. No changes at this time. It&#39;s starting to worry me because it feels like a hard mass that is painful and hot. (left deltoid).

The redness on my face and ears went away, but returned on a smaller area later in the afternoon, then went away and have not returned either in the 3 days since I&#39;ve had it.

                                                on Wed 1/6/21 I had an allergic reaction and am unsure what set it off.  My eyes became itchy, watery and my corneas swelled.  I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I began feeling an increase in heart rate about 5-8 minutes after injection. I reported symptoms and site began to monitor my pulse, which was 160. I then drank 32oz of water and took 400mg ibuprofen. I then began to feel dizziness. Blood pressure was normal. My chair was reclined and I was given about 2oz of orange juice. I was then moved to a stretcher and my legs were elevated on a chair. I took a restroom break. I began by walking, but started to see spots in my vision and sat in a wheelchair. I was able to use the restroom and return to stretcher and elevation of my legs. I was then taken to the ER. I used the restroom once more independently. Blood sample was taken. Heart rate was  160, blood pressure was normal. EKG was abnormal and I was given dosage of adenosine. First dose did not show necessary improvement and I was given a second dose, which dropped my heart rate to the 90s. I used the restroom independently and was given an additional EKG, which was normal. During this time my Physician contacted a Cardiologist, for consultation. I was then discharged with recommendation to follow up with cardiologist in 2-4 days.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

Around 8 pm the pain radiated up my shoulder across the top of my back. Around 10 pm I was suddenly hit with a wave of fatigue where my husband was unable to wake me from the couch to go to bed.  I woke up around 8:30 am on 1/7/21 with a debilitating headache, tingling in my fingertips,  and unsteadiness while walking. I was advised to go to the ED who gave no treatment other than recommending OTC pain meds, benedryl and rest. I returned home and took all the recommendations. At 4:41 pm, there has been no change with symptoms.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

                                                I received the vaccine at work Thursday {December 31st} morning, and started feeling sick that same evening. Including malaise, low grade fever..not higher than 99.6, mild sore throat, shortness of breath, dehydration/dry mouth, light-headedness/dizziness, runny nose, and coughing. These symptoms continued on and off from {12/31-and continued all throughout the weekend and continue as of today-01/04}. Fevers don&#39;t last long, they come and go. The main symptoms that are chronic and consistent are the runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath, and feeling tired/lethargic, just low energy.

I went to my gynecologist , first thinking I may have a yeast infection but she did not see a rash and couldn&#39;t diagnose me. She told me that my pain was probably neurological. She took my blood and sent it to a lab for possible yeast infection and STDs. She prescribed me Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Diporopionate 1%. I went to my PCP on Wednesday because the burning intensified and I thought that I may have shingles. I have a stuffy nose and my sense of smell isn&#39;t very good right now. My PCP gave me a Covid test and told me that she can not test me for shingles because I do not have a rash. She did prescribed me Gabapentin 100mg . I am awaiting Covid test and Lab results

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

Gradually pain increased radiating down to finger tips and up to left side of neck, stopped right below ear. Neck and shoulder muscles felt really tight- uncomfortable ache. Also got extremely tired- left side of face felt numb- left eye slightly blurry- I fell asleep about 10pm. Woke up a few hours later drenched in sweat. Face numbness gone, eyesight normal.? Patient reports the following day 1/9/2021 @ 2pm: ?All of a sudden I started to sweat all over. I didn?t feel hot, only last about 30 minutes.? Patient reports on Sunday 1/10/2021: ?Woke up feeling okay. Left arm and neck still ached but not as bad. Got fatigued around 10am. I got a headache that became really bad. Dizzy, nauseous- no relief from OTC meds. Headache went away after a few hours.? Patient reports today 1/11/2021: ?Today I am still very tired. My left arm, fingertips, shoulders and neck still ache. Face is flushed.? Patient does state previous reactions to prior vaccines: ?TdaP about 7 years ago made me have joint pain for months.

                                                About 10-20 seconds after receiving vaccine I felt faint and the darkness started to close in and I almost passed out.  The back of my tongue became very dry.   I felt better after 10 minutes and never passed out.  They took my vital signs and everything was normal.  I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

I started feeling dizzy, a buzzing in my ears and broke into a sweat. I tried to stand up and walk over to my bed, but lost my balance and collapsed for about 5 seconds. Once I regained consciousness I stopped sweating, rested for a bit and then was able to resume normal function (drinking water, coffee, something sugary).

Zaleplon insufficient duration so switched to Zolpidem PRN. She has not required more than a few doses of zolpidem but now we have uptitrated her to gabapentin 600mg nightly. She feels significant improvement in her sleep and work product, but continues to have intermittent cognitive errors and some decrease in work performance, that remain concerning to her.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

                                                Shot given at 3:47- approximately 3-5 minutes later started to experience blurred vision, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.   Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

                                                Employee Recollection: Wednesday and Thursday  felt kind of weak and more tired than normal, but thought nothing of it.  In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

                                                Just about 15 mins after recieving vaccination, I  experienced increased shortness of breath, feeling weak, slight headache, and my heart seemed to race.  When I shared this with the pharmasist, she did not offer to take vitals nor seemed concerned.  She suggested that I was experiencing anxiety, and that it was not a typical reaction to the vaccine.  However, each day since vaccine I have continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.  Today, 3 days after the vaccine, I had more shortness of breath than I had since first contracting Covid-19(which was on 10th of Dec).  I also was having to stop walking several times every 5 mins or so in order to catch my breath, feeling weakness and fatigue.  My sense or taste/smell is gone as well. I was so short of breath today, work was worried anough about me they urged me to go home and call my doctor.  I now have a tele-visit set up with my doctor today.

                                                The next morning (12/29/20) - I had typical symptoms -- &gt; minimal body aches/fatigue and a sore Left arm  At 6pm (12/29/20) -- &gt; I just finished dinner and all of sudden I felt like I zoned out/passed out for a minute.  When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 10 minutes after receiving vaccine throat began tingling and I noticed my heart rate was 164 on my apple watch.  Notified nursed overseeing the monitoring.  Nurses began hooking my up to monitoring equipment. Heart rate came down to 120.  Nurses noticed flushing in face and blotchiness on arms. After an additional 15 minutes of monitoring, flushing was still present as well as throat tingling (just tingling, no swelling), so nurses sent me to the ER for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to ER temperature was 100.2 F. (Temperature before vaccine was 97 F, no fevers recorded after ER visit).  In ER fluids and zofran were given and was released after two hours of monitoring.  In the evening I experienced moderate pain in the left arm (very painful to lift arm above shoulder level) that lasted about 24 hours.  I also had a mild to moderate headache that lasted about 24 hours, beginning the evening of the vaccine.   I also experienced mild to moderate nausea that began the day of the vaccine (Saturday, 12/26) and was on and off through Wednesday, 12/30.

                                                8 mins after the shot my throat started burning, heart pounding, shaking uncontrollably, throat felt like it was sticking together, dizzy, lost all my color, hives, tunnel vision, kept almost passing out. Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath.

Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                6 days after vaccination, I started to feel ill. Throat slightly scratching, almost like I was getting a cold. Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

On the fourth day and I woke up sneezing and could not stop. I had a lot of nasal congestion and a low grade fever (100.8), I also had a lot of fatigue. I had a little bit of a cough as well. This all lasted for about five days.  I also got a Covid test and that came back negative.

                                                Legs extremely weak and felt like muscles were not functioning well. Knees were buckling while standing. Started about 4 hours after vaccination. Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.

I had a rash around site that progressed up to the right side of my face and also right side of my lower back the following day. The rash was also accompanied by blotches and is still there only on the side of the injection. I had metallic taste for on and off the first 2-3 days. I am feeling a bit better, well enough to work today. Still very fatigued. On Thursday I also had a 102 fever that Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help me at all at night. I finally stopped sweating yesterday. The blotches are now improving . Only thing that remains is the fatigue.
