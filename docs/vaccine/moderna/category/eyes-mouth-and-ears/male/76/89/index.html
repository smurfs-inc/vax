                                                Patient received Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/30/2020 at a Pharmacy clinic where he was a resident. Nurses at the facility reported that he was responsive and showed no signs of any adverse effects until 1/2/2021 when he was observed slightly unresponsive and staring at the ceiling and trembling. He had a fever of 101F at this time. The facility ordered labs and a rapid COVID test (all of which came back normal) and started IV antibiotics. A few hours later, patient began bleeding from his eyes, nose, and mouth and was sent to the local ER. The patient refused being admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis/hemorrhage and died the following day on 1/3/2021. All healthcare professionals involved agreed that this was not likely due to the vaccine, but needed to be reported nonetheless.

                                                Approximately 8 hrs after the second Moderna vaccination I starting having chills. These continued and increased in intensity along with the onset of fever. I did not have an accurate means of taking my temperature at the time. Over the course of the night on the 17th/18th of February the chills and fever never subsided, even with two doses of Tylenol. The day of the 18th, fever and chills continued along with a feeling of intense malaise. My sternum was very sore and it hurt to breathe as a result of the prolonged shivering. I had no appetite and ate absolutely nothing the day of the 18th. In the early morning hours of the 19th my fever broke as did the chills. However, later in the day, a thermometer was obtained and my fever was 101.4 degrees. When taken at bedtime, it was down the 99 degrees and returned to normal later with no future spikes. On the morning of the 20th when I awoke, I noticed a stinging soreness in my mouth and lip area, followed later in the day with my nostrils and inner nose. This turned out to be an intense outbreak of Herpes. The roof of my mouth, gums, upper surface of my tongue, lips, nostrils, and inner nose ultimately became covered and extremely painful. These lesions were not typical blebs, but were tiny, albeit most painful. After five days they resolved and I have had no further issues. As a possible area to investigate - I had had the second Shingles booster 14 days prior to my first Moderna COVID vaccination. I understand Shingles is also a Herpes family virus.

I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

                                                Reported via Nurse Triage / PCP:  Fainted earlier, eyes rolled back, mouth was drooping. Nausea, weakness, and chills. BP was 107/75, HR in the 70s. Currently alert and resting.  States that patient had his 2nd covid vaccine yesterday AM and then develop chills and clammy skin last night.  Symptoms worsened today and patient became weak and fainted.  Was unconscious for about 5 minutes and while unconscious, mouth was open and drooling and became incontinent and eyes rolled back in head.  Is awake and alert now, but still weak and only able to take 1 or 2 steps.  No chest pain or breathing difficulty and no fever.  Feeling very nauseous.  Caller requesting prescription for zofran.      Yesterday AM 2nd vaccine. Last night chills. This AM feeling weak. Today at 11am he felt weak with ambulation. He fainted. Was unconscious for 5 min. Had drooping of the face. He was unresponsive during this time. Had incontinence of urine. Then became awake but very weak still. Only able to walk a few steps. He is communicating. No chest pain. No current fever. No shortness of breath. BP 107/75 with HR 70. He has been very nauseated. He is drinking only small sips of water. Does not seem like a usually COVID-19 vaccine reaction. Given the LOC with urinary incontinence and sustained weakness, I advised ER evaluation to rule out neurological issues. Pt&#39;s daughter in agreement. They will go to ER.  From Emergency Department:  Patient presenting with chief complaint of syncopal episode which was witnessed by his wife.  He reported the got dizzy and lightheaded and then passed out while seated.  The reported duration of his loss of consciousness was somewhat inconsistent, unclear how long he passed out for, there was however no postictal state.  He was not noted have any shaking or seizure activity, he did have an episode of urinary incontinence.  He has not been feeling well ever since receiving his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.  By the time of my exam patient states that he is completely asymptomatic, he states he is feeling much better after receiving IV fluids.  His lab work is remarkable for a slightly low sodium, compared to his previous levels which were many months ago.  Unclear of the acuity of this, although upon further discussion with the patient he has been drinking large amounts of water since his vaccine trying to stay hydrated.  I advised him to substitute to some electrolyte balanced fluids and to have his sodium rechecked by his PCP to ensure that this is transient.  With negative testing and resolution of his symptoms he is stable for discharge home.  Close return precautions were given.

He tried to stand up and then he passed out on the floor for about 10-15 minutes.  He went to sleep and woke up around 5 hours later.  He then tried it again and urinated on himself and he fell down on the floor, passed out without getting up until the morning.   He did call his doctor who was not available, spoke to the nurse and advised to go to the hospital.  He is weak and cannot drive so he did not go to the hospital.  He slept the rest of that day and the following day.  Then when he saw his doctor about 2 days ago, he described his reaction and told to report the reaction and that he would report it himself.  He was advised not to take the 2nd vaccination.  He is no longer having the heavy reaction, his muscles are aching and his vision is  blurred, especially on his back and the shoulder.   His doctor did do blood work at the office visit.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   Around 8 hours after the shot, my left shoulder started to hur, when I raised my arm. Over the next few hours I grew more tired than usual with a very low-level, generalized ache. I went to sleep at 11. I woke up at 2 in quite a bit of generalized pain, left shoulder so painful I could not lie on my left side, unable to get comfortable in any position, feeling worse and worse. At 2:30 I got up, which immediately made me feel a bit better. I took an acetominophen, a half codeine acetominophen #3, and around 5 ml promethazine/codeine syrup. At around 4:00 I had some cheese and bread. At around 4:30 I was able to go back to sleep. I got up at 8:30, still achy/hurting, but distinctly better. I am writing this at 11 a.m. One other thing to note: after the shot I seemed to be having a  very odd, mild allergic reaction intermittently, when I ate some foods that I eat every day. Mostly it was a case of my hard palate itching.

A neighbor is experiencing very SIMILAR symptoms. He is also 77 years old, and had his MODERNA booster shot about a week or so before I had mine, and we chatted this morning, so I concluded that our symptoms APPEAR to be related to the MODERNA booster.

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

                                                At this point I am going to give you an account of my past 14 months health and how I know it is related to the covid virus.   i am sure i have had long covid  from december 2019 or january 2020 to the present based on symptoms i incurred on these dates. On my first night I ended up vomiting my guts out at 2:00 in the am. The following 2 weeks I had constant diarrhea.  At the end of those 2 weeks,  i ended up in emergency room. And this all happening when  i haven&#39;t&#39; vomited in over 30 years.  vital signs and blood work were good at the hospital and the drs were confused as to why i felt so bad. i returned home the next day where our permanent home is,  and 3 months later the covid thing surfaced. at first being thought of as a respiratory disease. then in the past months it is surfacing that it may now be considered a gastrointestinal disease that progresses to a respiratory disease. after checking the five main symptoms of long covid i discovered that i have at least 3 of the 5  common symptoms for this. Those being extreme fatigue, joint pain, and cough. In addition to the long covid symptoms, I have encountered tasting issues on and off again.  I have had many discussions with my primary care doctor, and no results or conclusive information came from my inquiries. Then on feb 12, 2021 I got my first moderna shot. About 2-3 weeks later I encountered a sharp pain in a muscle in my neck left side. Shortly thereafter I got very light headed. Then another  week later while  driving a motor home, I encountered a frightening experience with my eyes, and the neck pain and soreness was still there. My vision was very blurred and I was seeing double vision at different angles. I ended up at the medical center and was admitted for 4 days. Before I was admitted, I saw a local ophthalmologist here and he diagnosed me with a condition known as ?edema in optic nerve, inferior, consistent with optic nephropathy?. The symptom I had to get me to the doctor was I was losing eyesight in my left eye. After hd steroid treatment for 4 days, and a plethora of tests, including spinal tap, multiple mri?s, and probably over 20 blood tests (11 at one draw), I was released 3-18-2021 and still can?t see above the equator line of my left eye. And I also am extremely sensitive to light. I also have sensitivity inside my eye as best described as a soreness, especially when I try to look upwards. I have a follow up appt with the ophthalmologists that I first saw that advised me to get to the hospital. And that is on mar 26th 2021.  to mention another point of interest, my granddaughters boyfriends mother is a charge nurse at the emergency ward at the hospital, and she has said that they also have recently encountered emergency patients, who have recently received moderna, and are also having issues with eye problems. What problems in particular, I haven?t a clue at this time.  This is at the very least, extremely alarming to me, and I have no idea whether I may completely lose all function of my left eye., or not. But I adamantly feel this should be investigated by the cdc and any and all other agencies that should be involved.  I would be willing to have further discussions via phone or whatever to help you out with an investigation.

                                                On Tuesday, February 16, I received my 1st Moderna Covid vaccine. On Tuesday, March 16, I received my 2nd Moderna Covid vaccine at 11AM and Eylea shots (one in each eye) at 2PM. I have been receiving Eylea every 3 months for about 3 years in one or both eyes.   On Saturday, March 20 at about 11:30AM, while sitting at traffic light, I saw what appeared to be a translucent sheet of plastic cover the left driver&#39;s window and the left half of the windshield. This was only visible in the left eye. Twenty seconds later, a yellow opaqueness developed in the left eye, which eventually cleared, but vision was still blurry. When I got home, I called my retinologist. He recommended I go into a dark room and close my eyes. At this time, I had white translucent vision in the lower left quadrant of vision in both eyes. My retinologist sent me to Eye Hospital Emergency Department, which is part of Hospital. After being assess at Eye Emergency Room, I was admitted to Hospital for a right occipital lobe stroke that was confirmed by multiple MRIs of the head. I was told that I was experiencing an ocular migraine (although I had no pain.) I was discharged on Monday, March 22, on Eliquis. As of April 15, all of the yellow opaque and white translucent visions are gone. However my left eye vision remains blurred and hazy. I have since been diagnosed with age-related cataracts in both eyes and a fast-moving cataract in top portion of left lens. I will also report this occurrence to the reporting system.

                                                Within one minute of my injection l felt numbness surround my mouth.  Three minutes later I felt flushed.  I asked my wife if my face was  red and she said, ?yes?. I felt somewhat weak and paramedic called the Dr over.  We talked and he determined that I had not eaten.  Walked me around car, put me in the passenger seat.  My wife  then drove.  I was a little disoriented late but didn?t complain. Since then I have felt like I did in July 2019 when I had coronial virus.  Felt bad, 93oxygen, 77 heart beat which is high for me.   Friday I did not get out of bed nor went outside. Sat more of the SamE.  Woke up at midnight sat and felt better.  I?m better but weak.

Tylenol didn&#39;t help.  Took one tab of Percocet (5-325) to allow me to sleep.    2/19/21 Contacted dentist and was prescribed Penicillin VK 500 mg. Started Penicillin around 3 pm.   2/19/21 ~6 pm onset shakes, chills, sweating, low grade fever (~100.2), nausea, headache, weakness,  difficulty in standing.  Took more tylenol, lay down, fell asleep for approximately 3 hours. Woke briefly took my nighttime meds (atrovastatin, metoprolol, ranolazine, baby aspirin.) Additional information for Item 18:  2/20/21 Felt better when I woke up.  Temp normal. Ate breakfast.  Mild stomach ache. Around 3 pm onset of sweating and chills, shakes. Low grade temp (~100)   2/22/21 Fully recovered.  No lingering issues.  Not sure whether what I experienced is related to the Moderna vaccine or a reaction to the Percocet I took to alleviate the severe pain associated with my toothache.

I could not bite down on not bite down with my teeth and could barely eat (on the left side of my mouth).  With some  Advil, I was able to sleep (poorly). This lasted for two more days then went away.  On 3/14/21 it began to recur but very mildly. This also lasted 2 more days then went away On 3/18/21 I had a dental appointment (not because of this - just routine). The dentist felt my reaction was totally related to the shot and not my teeth (which are in bad shape).

I have no other known reasons to suspect anything else to have caused the problems, the only thing I can relate the change to is having the two vaccinations.  I saw ENT an did a hearing test with significant loss of hearing in left ear and that was followed up with a basil endoscopy and no determination could be made from that. I?m scheduled for a brain scan on March 30th.

                                                When I woke up on March 31, I discovered I had lost total hearing in my right ear.  I went immediately to see my doctor.  There was no wax buildup, and the outer ear was clear.  I went the same day to see my Audiologist (since I wear hearing aids), and upon testing discovered there was a total loss of hearing in the right ear.  The left ear was the same as test results in October, 2020.  On April 2 I went to see dr.  He determined that I had suffered SSNHL, Sudden Sensory Neural Hearing Loss.  Dr. prescribed Prednisone, 10 mg tablets: 6 at one time for 4 days, then 4 at one time for 4 days, then 2 tablets for 4 days, then 1, then 1/2.   As of this date, April 6 there is yet no improvement

                                                lost most the hearing in the left ear; had a bad day generally; This spontaneous case was reported by a patient and describes the occurrence of DEAFNESS UNILATERAL (lost most the hearing in the left ear) in a 79-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 013L20A and 022M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).   On 26-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 11-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DEAFNESS UNILATERAL (lost most the hearing in the left ear) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and FEELING ABNORMAL (had a bad day generally). In April 2021, DEAFNESS UNILATERAL (lost most the hearing in the left ear) was resolving. At the time of the report, FEELING ABNORMAL (had a bad day generally) outcome was unknown.            No relevant concomitant medications were reported. The patient confirmed lost most of the hearing in the left ear by a visit to the clinic after a hearing exam was done. The patient stated that he can hear better now but the left ear was not usable and could not use a telephone. It was better now but still not ok and was still &#34;metallic.&#34; The patient does not know if 2nd dose had influenced the hearing and stated that he did not have prior history of hearing issues. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to events was not applicable. No treatment information was provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Patient states that he no longer has a headache.  He does have a history of a possible mini stroke approximately 10 years ago.  He has had no other recent cardiac problems, or any other strokelike symptoms since that time.  Patient takes medications for his cholesterol and a baby aspirin daily.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

Within a few days I developed a continuous very high pitch ring in both ears. I had never experienced this before, and thought it would go away. Then I asked my wife why she thought I would all of a sudden have ringing in my ears, and she said it?s tinnitus. I had never heard of tinnitus before, so I looked it up. None of the causes listed in the article from the clinic seemed to match my situation. I thought maybe it would go away, but it?s been 10 days and no change. It doesn?t seem to have affected my hearing that I can tell. Also I?m not a stressful person. I don?t know if it will go away, or there?s anything that can be done, or if I should see a doctor. I suppose I can live with it, but it is annoying. The most important question is whether or not I should get the second vaccination scheduled for April 1, 2021 as that might even make it worse.

Earlier in the day he complained of not feeling well, but non-specific.  He was assessed and given an albuterol nebulizer treatment. In the coming hour, his wheezing resolved, work of breathing improved, heart rate and respirations decreased. He was ambulating around without signs of activity intolerance. It was felt that he was stable and back to baseline, so he was monitored by the nursing staff. A chest x-ray was ordered but not completed.  On 1/1/2021 at approximately 0925, a nursing assistant described loss of consciousness for 20-25 seconds. It appeared that he was not breathing, slumped over in the chair at the breakfast table eating cream of wheat, eyes rolled back in his head. He regained consciousness, breathing normally after coughing. He did not appear to be choking. His heart rate was recorded as irregular, rate 32 by the nursing staff. He was transported to the Emergency Department at Hospital for evaluation. No concerning findings.

                                                The night of the vaccine at 9:00 PM his right arm was totally numb.  He got up and took magnesium maleate, and it started clearing up the numbness, and took a baby aspirin.  His right eye went blurry as if he had a cataract in that eye.  Part of the eye was different, crescent vision.  He then took some vitamins for eye, and took an Astroxanthem and started to have some benefit.  He then took Epicor and it cleared up.  A couple of days later he then had some blurry vision again and took some more vitamins, and it cleared up.  He did get some dry eye drops and is using them.    All the symptoms have resolved now.   He does have an appointment with his eye doctor next month.  Has not seen a regular MD or PCP in over 10 years.

                                                On February 26 I got my second Moderna booster shot. On March 2 I got a blood test for my routine medical annual checkup. It showed my RBC and my WBC were below the minimum normal levels and my platelet count was 100, well below the 140 lower normal limit. Also, my lower lip was swollen and chapped.  On March 8 I went in for a second blood hematology panel. My  WBC was normal, my RBC was 4.31 where 4.5 is normal, and my platelet count was 123. My lower lip was still swollen and chapped. Today on March 13, my lower lip is still swollen and chapped.

                                                On 11/25/20 had a physical and they took him off of Atenolol, and put him on Metoprolol, one a day at bedtime.  He took those for almost 2 months without any problem until he got his shot.  He took his pill at 10:00 when he went to bed, woke him up around 12:30 AM and had severe itching all over his back, and his mouth, tooth area felt like they fell asleep.  Got some water and rinsed his mouth and felt that it was something he ate.  Again for the next 2 nights after taking his blood pressure medicine he was woken up with the same feeling (like it was asleep).  It did not affect his swallowing.  He then called his doctor and he put him back on his other medicine, and not having any trouble since switching back to Atenolol.  He is scheduled for the 2nd vaccine on 2/25/21.   Has an APT with his PCP 2/16/21.

At that time, his speech became slurred.  They got a neighbor, who is a nurse, to come over. She recommended medical attention.  They went to an urgent care center and were immediately sent to the hospital.. Left side of his face was drooping and his speech was slurred.  There were no cognitive issues.  Arrived at hospital around 1:30. He was assessed immediately for a stroke and it was determined that he had not had a stroke.  Bell&#39;s Palsy was diagnosed.  He was given a steroid injection at the hospital and given a Medrol dosepak to begin on Saturday, Feb. 20 and sent home.   As of today, Monday, February 22, his symptoms are improving.

I was woken up by the smell and went around the house trying to find the source. The smell was strongest in the bedroom, and so I had to be the source, either a heightened and distorted sense of smell or passing gas while asleep. Possibly my gut is reacting to something COVID. I wanted you to have this information in case you collect statistics on such.

                                                Admission Note: ? Weakness - Generalized     Patient reports feeling weak prior to dialysis, but demanded clinic to perform dialysis. Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.

                                                Patient presents today with his wife and son. He was recently hospitalized having developed a fever the day after his Covid vaccine 1 with associated confusion and some ataxia. He was admitted to the hospital overnight where an MRI scan suggested no acute change showing only moderate cerebral atrophy and some small vessel occlusive changes. He tested positive for Covid by PCR in the emergency department on 1/22. His oxygen saturation was stable. He did have a fever and describes falling off the toilet because of some generalized leg weakness and uncoordination. He has had some chronic left greater than right upper extremity sensory loss following prior cervical spine stenosis requiring urgent surgery in 3/2019. He has had some chronic left foot drop as well. He reports being somewhat deconditioned having spent some time in bed to the above episode but is now ambulating with a cane at home and has occupational and physical therapy in place. He has been mildly dyspneic on exertion above baseline but attributes this to some deconditioning. He did have an episode of lower dental pain with ambulation in the office that was more than usual though denies associated chest pain or pressure and has had no jaw or shoulder pain with exertion. Review of systems is negative for headache.

                                                Nine days after receiving the shot, patient broke out in hives on his abdomen. The hospital told him to take Benadryl which did not reduce the hives. The hives continued to spread over his abdomen and become itchier. On day 11 after the shot, his lips began to swell. On day 12, January 26, he went to the emergency room due to the lip swelling and hives. They prescribed 10mg Cetirizine HCL twice per day. He took it for three days. The lip swelling went down and the hives started to subside the day he started to take the Cetirizine.  Note: He had two hives appear on his chest within 24 hours of the second dose. That was COVID-19 (Moderna) 013M20A on February 11, 2021. He immediately took the Citirizine for three days and they did not get any worse and cleared up.

                                                I did have and still have soreness of shoulder where I got the injection. That I can expect to stay. When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.
