                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

                                                Patient awoke the morning of March 5th feeling weak, fatigued, and unsteady. He went to his primary care provider 5 days later on the 10th of March, as his symptoms were not improving. He told his PCP there that the past few days he was suffering from unsteady gait, walking around like hes &#34;drunk&#34;, and bouncing off walls. It was thought his symptoms were caused by a low serum potassium value, so he was given a rx for potassium. 3 days later the patient presented to the emergency room where his problems persisted. He was still having trouble keeping balance when he walked around. One of the providers treating him reached out to neurology, who recommended that the patient be started on high dose steroids followed by a prednisone taper for tranverse myelitis, The patient was then admitted and treated at Hospital.

                                                At this point I am going to give you an account of my past 14 months health and how I know it is related to the covid virus.   i am sure i have had long covid  from december 2019 or january 2020 to the present based on symptoms i incurred on these dates. On my first night I ended up vomiting my guts out at 2:00 in the am. The following 2 weeks I had constant diarrhea.  At the end of those 2 weeks,  i ended up in emergency room. And this all happening when  i haven&#39;t&#39; vomited in over 30 years.  vital signs and blood work were good at the hospital and the drs were confused as to why i felt so bad. i returned home the next day where our permanent home is,  and 3 months later the covid thing surfaced. at first being thought of as a respiratory disease. then in the past months it is surfacing that it may now be considered a gastrointestinal disease that progresses to a respiratory disease. after checking the five main symptoms of long covid i discovered that i have at least 3 of the 5  common symptoms for this. Those being extreme fatigue, joint pain, and cough. In addition to the long covid symptoms, I have encountered tasting issues on and off again.  I have had many discussions with my primary care doctor, and no results or conclusive information came from my inquiries. Then on feb 12, 2021 I got my first moderna shot. About 2-3 weeks later I encountered a sharp pain in a muscle in my neck left side. Shortly thereafter I got very light headed. Then another  week later while  driving a motor home, I encountered a frightening experience with my eyes, and the neck pain and soreness was still there. My vision was very blurred and I was seeing double vision at different angles. I ended up at the medical center and was admitted for 4 days. Before I was admitted, I saw a local ophthalmologist here and he diagnosed me with a condition known as ?edema in optic nerve, inferior, consistent with optic nephropathy?. The symptom I had to get me to the doctor was I was losing eyesight in my left eye. After hd steroid treatment for 4 days, and a plethora of tests, including spinal tap, multiple mri?s, and probably over 20 blood tests (11 at one draw), I was released 3-18-2021 and still can?t see above the equator line of my left eye. And I also am extremely sensitive to light. I also have sensitivity inside my eye as best described as a soreness, especially when I try to look upwards. I have a follow up appt with the ophthalmologists that I first saw that advised me to get to the hospital. And that is on mar 26th 2021.  to mention another point of interest, my granddaughters boyfriends mother is a charge nurse at the emergency ward at the hospital, and she has said that they also have recently encountered emergency patients, who have recently received moderna, and are also having issues with eye problems. What problems in particular, I haven?t a clue at this time.  This is at the very least, extremely alarming to me, and I have no idea whether I may completely lose all function of my left eye., or not. But I adamantly feel this should be investigated by the cdc and any and all other agencies that should be involved.  I would be willing to have further discussions via phone or whatever to help you out with an investigation.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

Within a few hours, my left hand began to tingle and my right leg felt stiff. I experienced a loss of balance that made walking difficult.  For the next 24 hours I became very fatigued. But two days after the vaccination, I have begun to regain my strength.

                                                I did have and still have soreness of shoulder where I got the injection. That I can expect to stay. When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.
