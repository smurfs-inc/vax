                                                My birthfather had an adverse reaction after he got his 1st Moderna COVID vaccine.  He lives alone and was doing well with some underlying conditions. The day of the shot was fine.  The next AM, he had vision changes and sudden numbness in his R arm/leg and fell after getting up.  ?The numbness went away pretty quickly, but the visual changes remained.  He refused to go to the ER/Dr.  The next week and a half, he was weak, tired, and couldn?t think as clearly.  ?He was brought to the ER? on Wed, 3/3/21 at Hospital.  He was found to have a low oxygen level, possible a-fib, fluid retention, emphysema, and aortic stenosis, in addition to his other health issues.  ?The Dr said his symptoms the day after the vaccine were a mini-stroke..  He was released from the hospital on Friday, 3/5/21.  On Saturday, Hospice came to see him, since nothing can be done for his medical conditions; however, they decided not to sign him up yet, since he I was told they didn&#39;t feel he needed to, at this time.  One of my sisters is staying with him during the day until he builds his strength back up.  Do you think his Mini stroke and health changes had anything to do with the vaccine? He will not be getting the second COVID shot.   ?We?re all caught between a rock and a hard place as far as what to do, esp for older folks.

                                                Another customer in the store called over to the technician and pharmacist on duty stating the patient looked sick. He had dropped his timer that was counting down his 15 min post dose wait time. Pharmacist approached patient and asked him how he was doing. He was initially non-responsive, eyes were slightly glazed over. I repeatedly asked him his name and how he was doing. He began to respond after prompting, saying he felt very hot and sweaty. He stated he was thirsty and he hadn&#39;t eaten anything before his dose. Technician obtained a glass of water and a granola bar for the patient. Patient began to improve just minutes after food and water. He stated he thought he had stood for too long while waiting for his shot and hadn&#39;t eaten that morning so he began to feel sick. Patient recovered enough to call his daughter to pick him up from the store. His daughter arrived to pick him up and patient was able to walk out of the store without issue.
