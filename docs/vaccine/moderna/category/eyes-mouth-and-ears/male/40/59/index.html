Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

The left side of my tongue is numb with slight pain, and my bottom lip is numb on the left side, and the feeling stops at the middle like there were a line drawn down my face.  My upper left cheek and the side of my left eye have a constant,  moderate burning feeling.  The shot was in my left arm.  The Dr. at urgent care said it was not a stroke, so that&#39;s good.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  It has now been over 13 hours.

The next morning the areas around my eyes were swollen and I had two styes in my right eye.  I do not know if these were related.  These symptoms lasted approximately 3 days.  Some minimal swelling and tenderness seemed to remain, and approximately a week later I experienced a painful resurgence of the swelling at the injection site that was far larger, harder and more painful.  I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen.  These relieved the symptoms within 48 hours.

He said he felt like his head was being compressed. His lower lip began to feel numb and tingly, eventually this feeling spread into his mouth and throat. He was coherent the entire time. He received oral Benadryl while waiting for his wife to arrive to drive him to the emergency room.

                                                Within minutes of receiving my Moderna Covid-19 vaccine around 5pm, my left eye felt irritated. I didn&#39;t think much of it but it stayed slightly irritated. About 1am, as I prepared for bed, it had become red and was quite irritated. I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night and my eye was quite irritated and it was filled with tears. The next two days it remained irritated in this way, red and painful. As of now (over 48 hours later), it is still red and irritated.

                                                Received first dose of Moderna vaccine on Tuesday 2/23/2021 and began to feel tingling on the right side of my head and an ear ache the next day (Wednesday 2/24/2021). The symptoms got progressively worse over the next few days and on Sunday 2/28/2021 the right side of my face was completely paralyzed. I sought emergency care at Hospital Emergency Room where I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. The doctor who treated me strongly believes that the Bells Palsy was due to the Moderna vaccine. Today (9 days post vaccine) the entire right side of my face continues to be completely paralyzed with no signs of improvement.

Left eye blin is weak and unable to fully close left eye.  Left ear was aggravated and irritated when scratched.  Hearing is distorted, felt as if I had been submerged in water for a prolonged amount of time.  There is ringing at times on left ear as well.  Symptoms were progressive.  Today (05-MAR-2021), also developed vertiginous sensation and light-headedness.

                                                Patient felt to be in distress at the close of his observation time. He was complaining of trouble with focusing his eyes, left sided chest pain, and was diaphoretic.  Pt appeared to be in moderate distress and very anxious. I examined the pt through the car window and listened to his heart and lungs. Pt was not in respiratory distress and heart rate and rhythm were regular. Reassurance was provided to the pt, but he was also told that to be safe I recommended that he be evaluated in the emergency department and that he be transported via ambulance. Pt expressed understanding and agreed to going to the ED but was refusing transport via EMS. Pt was the passenger in the vehicle and he said that the driver could just take him. I expressed that transport via EMS would be the safest but we could not make him go via EMS and that if they wanted to leave via private vehicle then they could but i still recommended that he be evaluated in the ED. He expressed understanding and that he would go directly to the ED via personal car.

                                                Patient received vaccine at 3:15 pm on 3/12/21 and stayed in pharmacy area for 15 min (he left feeling fine). After about an hour 4:15 he showed back up at the pharmacy telling our pharmacy technician that he lost his voice and his throat was closing. She rushed him to the waiting room where I, pharmacist, came out and asked him what was going on. He stated he was with a client and suddenly lost his voice, and felt his throat starting to close. I asked if he was having trouble breathing and he said yes because his throat was closing and his whole arm was tingling. I had him take his mask down and try to take a few deep breaths first. I asked for permission to administer an Epi-pen which he gave verbal consent. 911 was called. Patient stated he did not want 911 called because he was going to refuse service.  After a min or so patient stated his throat was back open and he was feeling good. I informed him paramedics are on their way and he needed to stay in the waiting room because effects of the EpiPen can wear off in 15 min.  I stayed with him and watched until paramedics arrived. Paramedics sat with him and he did refuse service (they did take his blood pressure).  When paramedics asked the patient about when he came in they asked if he was having trouble breathing and he responded &#34;no I could breathe, my voice was just hoarse&#34; (which is the opposite of what he told the technician and myself). He also sounded like it was very hard to breathe. I did information to the paramedics after saying that he told us his throat was closing of which they stated that they figured that was the case and they knew the patient and assumed he would refuse service.   Patient was in contact with his primary care doctor who told him he could go home if his BP was ok but to make sure he had someone to drive him home.  Patient had his wife come to get him and they left.

Within few hours, developed dry cough and later slight fever, runny nose, and pimple like on the back of the tongue.  Bleed start when scraping the tongue after brushing teeth.  One week later on Sunday 2.21 the coughing started and stay consistent (over the counter cough and flu med did not do anything) until the week of 2nd dose...Called doctor on March 9, 2021 with chronic dry coughing.  I had concerns abt 2nd dose due date but he approved and told me to take allergy med and prescribed  benzonatate.  The benzonatate was useless against the cough and only the allergy helped stopped the coughing!

                                                A little less than 3 hours after getting the shot, I noticed the injection site was getting very sore. Within about a half hour of first noticing it, that entire muscle was aching a lot. It?s now 4:50pm and it hurts to lift my arm, reach for anything, I can even feel it just by typing this out. I?ve also noticed I?m pretty tired, my joints feel very achey like when I have a cold, and I?m incredibly thirsty. The pain in the muscle at injection site is by far the worst symptom though. It?s extremely painful. I did not expect that since it didn?t hurt when getting the actual shot. Took my temp and it?s normal. The aching joints are far less painful than my arm, but are an issue nonetheless. Had I known this would happen beforehand, I would still get the shot, so as long as it doesn?t get a lot worse or something else haplens, all in all I?d have to say it was worth it.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

Didn&#39;t think anything of it, Monday my right eye began to water like crazy. Didn&#39;t think anything of it. Tuesday morning I had a hard time eating breakfast because I couldn&#39;t open my mouth wide enough and was hitting my bottom lip with my teeth. i thought it was strange but didn&#39;t think anything of it. Took a shower about 11;30 and when I looked in the mirror I notice the ride side of my face was not responding like the left side, I called my doctors office and they got me right in. After a brief consultation they called ER and told me I would be on my way. I checked into ER at about 1;30pm.

I called my doctor back around 1300 and he told me to switch back to the regular amoxicillin.  By 1640 my vision in my left eye started to get blurry and my entire left side of my face was numb and paralyzed =.  My doctor told me to go to the ER.  Being the stubborn person I am I didn?t go right away. 2/13/21 I went to the hospital.  I was diagnosed with Bell?s Paulsy.  The doctor did not seem to think I had an ear infection.  My entire left side of my face is paralyzed.  I still have pain behind my right ear and around the ear canal.  My vision in my left eye is terrible.   My speech is getting slurry.  2/16/21 I followed up with my primary doctor.  He is hoping with the treatment I&#39;m on this will go away in 1 to 2 weeks.  He encouraged me to fill this adverse reaction form out. I have a follow on 2/17/21 with and ophthalmologist for my blurred vision.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

                                                Woke up at 2 am the morning after the injection with my arm extremely sore, swollen, red, and feverish to the touch that has continued for 4 days now. I also experienced a fever for 2 days after the injection along with dizziness, weakness, fatigue, headache, body aches, vision changes, and ringing in both ears. As of today 1/12/21 I am still experiencing symptoms even while using Benadryl allergy tablets by mouth and anti-itch cream applied to the injection site.

The symptoms sided over the last 12 hours of the 36 hours mentioned. A very light state of feeling tired persisted another 24 hrs as well as a slightly elevated temperature (1-1.5 degrees). I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

                                                On the first day I had a huge lump underneath my armpit I did not become too concerned with that I read it was something that could happen regarding the lymph node. 10 days later I woke up at 3:30 in the morning and had to dial 911 my throat felt like it was closing and my lips were both swollen. I went in the ambulance they brought me to the emergency room where they gave me Benadryl a steroid and some IV fluids. as soon as I receive the Benadryl my throat started to open up and my lips both started to go down . My lip continue to swell for the next three days on and off often on. Every time it swelled up I took Benadryl and every time sure enough it went away . The day I came home from the hospital I thought I was doing much better until that following night I became severely nauseous. I don?t know if it was something that they had given me in the hospital or still a reaction that was going on in my body, but I had some sort of stomach bug I threw up that whole day, had chills sweats  and a pounding headache that would not go away for over 48 hours .I was unable to eat or drink for 24 hours and had to go to an urgent care where they provided me with some medication for nausea. My concern right now is I am hearing that the second shot hits a lot harder than the first one and if this was a reaction to the shot I am very afraid of what will go on if I get the second one.  I cannot take a chance with my life.  I really want to shot I work in an environment where I am working with the department  which is why I was able to get the vaccine so early I feel safe being vaccinated I am very disappointed that this happened I just cannot take a chance having a family etc. Also I have very bad medical in Sherance so I am dealing with all of the bills from this hospital stay I have a  deductible which I can?t afford and then only 50% is covered afterwards. That is the reason I do not go to the hospital under no circumstance unless I am dying which that night I was that scared I felt the need I had to go.

Mother took him to the doctor who diagnosed him with Bell&#39;s Palsy.   Dr. prescribed Prednisone and Valacyclovir for these symptoms.  He still has some drooping of his eye and mouth, but doctor said it may take a couple of weeks.  He does have blurry vision due to this as well.  The injection site itself has no problems.   He has a FU next week with his doctor.

                                                I was driving on the highway and experienced numbness starting in my lips.  This numbness then moved throughout my body into my limbs.  I had some mobility and was able to pull off of the highway down an exit but at one point, I could not lift my legs or control my hands.  I called 911 but it was very difficult to do so with the numbness.  I then started to regain my mobility but had some continued numbness around the left side of my mouth.  The paramedics tested my vitals and everything came back as normal.    They recommended that I have someone come pick me up. So I had a neighbor come pick me up and someone drive my car home.  I did not lose any vision or mental capacity throughout this.  It was just a wave of numbness throughout my entire body.  It lasted 5-10 minutes but felt like an eternity. I am lucky to be alive and to not have crashed my vehicle into someone or something.

                                                Arm hurt after shot, I waited the 15 minutes and nothing else happened so I went home. On way home my lips started to tingle a bit and I felt warmer over my body. I got home and felt exhausted for multiple days but on the first day I could not sleep. By the weekend I was just worn out and slept all day the following Sat and Sunday.  My arm hurt so bad I couldn?t lay on it and I even  today either have phantom arm pain or real arm pain. But I know where the shot was because I feel it. It still feels like a deep tissue bruise.

Every night since last Tuesday January 27th I have woken up drenched in sweat multiple times a night.  Assuming this is a fever breaking.  I reported this to my doctor today and he advised me to go to this site.  If it continues I will see him next week. I have also had chills and eyes burning during the day ever since the 2nd shot.  The day after the 2nd shot my fever went to 101.5.  But I did not think that irregular since I heard that was a possibility.  The days after though I dont think are a regular vaccine event.

                                                Within 48 hours of receiving the COVID vaccine, I began having extreme pressure and discomfort in my right ear.  Symptoms included dizziness, fullness in the ear and hearing loss.  This persisted for several days.  As a first course of action, I took Tylenol and antihistamines.   I saw my PCP a few days later and he misdiagnosed my condition and suggested that I continue with antihistamines and Flonase.  Two weeks later my condition had improved only slightly and I became more concerned.  I asked my PCP whether a short course of steroids was warranted (at the suggestion of my mom and wife, who are both health care professionals).  He prescribed a &#34;dose pack,&#34; which I started on or about Monday, Feb. 22.  Later that week, I connected with an ENT  who is a friend of a friend .  When I told him my story and symptoms he was extremely concerned and got me an immediate appointment on Friday, Feb. 26.  At that visit I was diagnosed with acute and severe Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that had resulted in 92% hearing loss in my right ear.   Additional symptoms continue to include fullness, tinnitus and other discomfort.  None of these issues existed prior to my COVID vaccine shot.  I am currently undergoing a treatment of high dose prednisone and steroid injections in my ear.   I am scheduled for another visit with doctor on Friday, March 12.

                                                After 24 hours, I started having body aches, that night couldn&#39;t sleep I took Ibuprofen it helped, over the weekend I kept taking Ibuprofen. Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                30 minutes after the shot I started to feel numbnes and hot on left of my face and ear.  It didn&#39;t really worried me at that time because I thought it is normal and it will go away. It didn&#39;t go away and I felt hotness around my face ear, and my hearing in my right ear was slighly worse, including some pain in the ear. First time I contacted my family doctor 4 days later when the symptoms got worse. My dr told me to use Ibuprofen 600 3 times a day for 3 days. After I didn&#39;t see any improvement I scheduled the appointment and saw my doctor 8 days after the vaccination. My doctor said my ear is clear and there was no infection and she gave me different antinflamatory medicine to take it for a week tis time. She didn&#39;t think that was from  the vaccine though. After a week It seems that I felt better but still not completely recovered. I stopped taking this medication after a week as descibed. the sympthomcame back and now I&#39;m 16 days after the shot and 6 day before the second dose and I&#39;m scared what to do.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

I had stopped moving to rearrange some items. While stopped, I started to feel lightheaded, develop tunnel vision, and feel faint, almost to the point of blacking out. I put my head down and legs up and felt somewhat better. I then attempted to return to my car. I could go 100-200 yards at a stretch, before having to purposefully fall down and elevate my legs. I traveled the mile back to my car like this (slowly). I could not check my pulse because my hands were too cold; my respiration rate was elevated. At the car, I drank fluids and warmed up and began to recover enough to get home.

                                                Vaccine was administered to patient in his room at 12:50pm.  After the patient finished his lunch in his room he was wheeled out to the nursing station for observation.  at 1:30pm the nurse wheeled patient into our working/set up area and stated that patient is having a vaccine reaction.  I observed that his lips were noticeably swollen.  I asked patient to stick out his tongue, it also was noticeably swollen.  Only the tip of his tongue extended about 1/2 inch past his lips.  I administered 0.3mg of Epinephrine via and epi-pen into his right thigh and instructed the nursing staff to call 911.  Patient improved markedly over the next 10 minutes when Fire Department EMT&#39;s arrived.  Nursing staff monitored his  blood pressure, heart rate and pulse  and oxygen sat.  heart rate was elevated somewhat likely due to epi , BP was 121/73, pulse steady and ox sat good.  Fire Department transported patient to a nearby ER for further evaluation and treatment if necessary.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 23 Dec 2020, approximately four days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20-2A) intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 27 Dec 2020, the patient experienced decreased vision.  On 29 Dec 2020, the physician examined the patient. There was some retinal hemorrhage, venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion. Lab work was requested by the physician and results were pending. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events, loss of vision, decreased vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a  46 year old male patient. The patient&#39;s medical history is not provided. The patient experienced a serious, unexpected event of loss of vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade  central retinal occlusion. The event occurred 4 days after first dose of the mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information are required for further assessment.

                                                I developed tinnitus in my ears about 3 to 4 hours after vaccine. I normally don&#39;t get this. Rarely after a concert or game but short lived. This has stuck around and I kept waiting for it to disappear. Unfortunately it has not. My right ear is worse than my left but the tinnitus remains so I thought I should report it. I have been looking on-line for any other reports and see none. This may be coincidence but due to lack of resolution of tinnitus, I thought I should report it. My flu-like symptoms (headache, shaking chills, sore arm) disappeared within 36 hours.

Thinking it might be a Conjunctivitis, assuming it was a windy week in my area, I did do some yard work. That night it started to build pressure, pain and headache.  I asked my spouse to buy me eyedrops., did used with no relief. I&#39;ve putting cold packs at the beginning, but it gives me more headache, I changed to warm compress, and had some relief.  For 4 days I suffered the same symptoms and discomfort, not until the 4th day (Friday) I can&#39;t take it anymore, I went to an urgent care, they check my V/S, BP is elevated, ranging from 140&#39;s/92&#39;s. They check my eye pressure, it was elevated.  The PA prescribed Tobramycin eyedrop(Tobrex) and recommend me to see an Ophthalmologist to do further evaluation.  The next day 5th day (Saturday) went to Dr., get evaluated both of my eyes had high pressure,

I also had a metallic taste.   3.  Fortunately, the chills, body aches, and fatigue went away the second day.  However, I continued to have the metallic taste for days. 4.  Also, starting the third day and I still have a cough and tightness in my lungs.  I went into a doctor at urgent care four days after the second dose (due to a concern about the cough and tightness in my lungs).  All of my vitals were normal and they attributed to side effects from the vaccine.  Also, they gave me an inhaler. 5.  The inhaler has been somewhat helpful, but I had a consistent cough as well as  some tightness in my lungs for two weeks after the second dose.  On unusually stressful days, it was even worse. 6.   The cough has improved, but I still have it occasionally throughout the day as well as the tightness in my lungs.   7.  Finally, I continue to have the metallic taste.

About April 13, 2021, my tinnitus began to significantly increase, especially in my right ear (3/10 left ear, 5/10 right ear). It was annoying, but I was able to sleep. Though I did get a little anxious about whether it was permanent or would get worse.  It peaked on May 1, 2021 (4/10 left ear, 6/10 right ear), and has been slowly getting better since then. I&#39;d now characterize the left ear varying between 2-3/10, and right ear varying between 3-4/10.

It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

Got epi 0.3 mg IM, Decadron 10 mg IV, Zyrtec 10 mg, Pepcid 40 mg po, Benadryl 25 mg po, with improvement.  Allergy consulted, felt this was likely delayed hypersensitivity reaction to Moderna, but couldn&#39;t exclude lisinopril side effect.  They recommended Zyrtec 10 mg bid for 1 wk, and stay off lisinopril.  Will follow up in Clinic to determine how to approach 2nd shot.

At 22 h after the vaccine I could not abduct my arm due to the local pain, became prostrated (had to lay down all day), lost appetite (only ate 2 cookies all day) and became very fatigued (went to sleep at night at 7 pm instead of my 10 pm regular sleeping time). I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence.

                                                Both eyes very swollen, watery and itching on evening of 3/16. Appeared pretty quickly. Could be &#39;normal&#39; allergies, but was quite a bit more of a reaction than I would normally get. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve had my eyes swell this much before that I can remember. During day of 3/16 did not do anything outside in or around normal triggers when doing something like yard work. Took Kroger brand max strength sinus relief pills and went to bed. Morning of 3/17 eyes still swollen but not as much...much less watering and itching. Still swollen some at the time of this submission.

                                                Once, for a short time while performing a mild workout in the gym, and again a couple hours later, and for an extended duration (approximately 40 minutes),  while checking out at Costco I experienced what I believe to have been aura migraines without headache (or ocular migraines) in my right eye. What initially appeared to be a slight glare, I later determined was an obscuration of the lower half of my vision in that eye which could be described as a clouding effect.  While disorienting and concerning, with closing/covering that eye, the problem slowly resolved itself. Within about 20 minutes, I had enough vision to comfortably and safely drive home. Another 20 minutes after that and the event had ended as far as I could tell.  I have never experienced anything like this in the past. Doing some (dangerous, I know) searching online, I discovered what it might be called and learned that there were some reports of similar events occurring with other vaccine recipients. Since I don&#39;t have a primary care physician, I&#39;m hoping it is directly related to the vaccine and I hope it doesn&#39;t happen again with the second dose since my eyes are a critical part of my job.

                                                After two days I experienced a loud ringing noise in both of my ears.    It&#39;s been over two weeks and the noise has not subsided.      I have a Son that suffers from tinnitus - I would compare the symptoms to those of my son&#39;s tinnitus.  I have had to purchase a white noise machine to assist with sleeping.     This is very alarming - had I known of the outcome I would not have taken the vaccine.  I hope this noise reduces over time.    I would be happy to discuss more if requested.

The patient developed headache, lack of taste, fatigue as well as the aforementioned rash on 1/14/2021(6 days after receiving first dose of covid vaccine.  A rapid covid test was positive on 1/14/2021 also.  The patient was prescribed claritin, methylprednisolone for the rash after seeing his family physician virtually and the family physician recommended he contact where he was vaccinated to report these symptoms.  I have reached out to the patient for additional information and he has declined, so I do not have any access to details on his positive covid test or records from that virtual encounter.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

                                                Given second shot on Wed 2/24 at 12pm -- Had flu like symptoms for one day.  Woke up on Sat 2/27 with sudden hearing loss in left ear. Hearing loss was accompanied by a loud static sound and pressure. Saw ENT specialist on Tue 3/2 -- no evidence of any wax buildup. She immediately sent me for hearing test; showed 70% loss. Both doctors feel this is a Viral infection and that it may have occurred due to my strong  immune response I had to the COVID vaccine. Was prescribed 60mg of Prednisone for two weeks; am on day 3 as of writing this. Am going to see another specialist tomorrow, 3/5/21. I am a healthy 50yr old male with no previous hearing problems. The only change in my life was getting the vaccine. I think this important to report, although I have yet to find any link between vaccine and SSHL. I have been tested over the last year a few times (mouth swab) and all test were negative. I have not been tested since my hearing loss, though I don&#39;t feel sick at all. I have read that some people who actually had COVID experienced new or increased tinnitus but did not find anyone who had actual hearing loss -- this was just doing some online reading; not actual study reports.

At 5:00 pm, I got out of work, I went straight home because I felt so weak and my eyes got watery (didn&#39;t go to work out afterward) and I got the chills and my bones started to hurt, I went to bed and slept all - my bones were in horrific pain - especially in my back. Saturday morning, I felt the same -I took OTC med for the pain - no fever; body aches, watery eyes and I was very weak. I drank orange juice and I took some Zinc; vitamin C - and I hurt all that day - bones still achy but not quite as much. Sunday morning, I wasn&#39;t normal but better and by Sunday noon I was better; not weak anymore. On a scale from one to 10, I felt like a ten when it was bad. My injection site was sore for a good four days. I took it on a Friday but Tuesday the arm was good to go.

                                                1.  Woke up the day after receiving the first dose without the ability to taste anything.  I could smell soaps/mint/fragrant lotions etc, if I sniffed it up close, but I could not taste anything. I tested this with several different  types of food.  This lasted until about 12:30 pm that day.  When I ate lunch I could taste my food again.   This was a strange event for me. I have never lost my sense of taste before.  2.  The evening of the third day after receiving the first dose of the moderna COVID-19 vaccine I experienced an approximate 4 inch diameter redness and itching around the injection site on my left shoulder.  There was also an itchy rash that extended across my chest and back to my right shoulder.  I took an antihistamine and went to bed.  When I awoke the next day the rash extending across my chest, back, and right shoulder was gone.  However, my left shoulder still  itched for the rest of that day.  The itchiness was gone when I awoke the next day.

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy/ Facial paralysis/ Dropiness on the rightside; Light sensitivity; Tearing; Felt like flu; Sore; A spontaneous report was received from a 50 year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced sore, felt like had the flu, light sensitivity, tearing of his right eye, Bell&#39;s palsy (right eye won&#39;t blink on its own, lip and speech issues).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A), intramuscularly in left arm, for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10 Jan 2021, he was sore, felt like had the flu. On 13 Jan 2021, he experienced light sensitivity, and tearing of his right eye. On 19 Jan 2021, he went to the emergency room and found with facial paralysis, droopiness on the right side. He was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy (right eye won&#39;t blink on its own, lip and speech issues).  Treatment included Valtrex.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the event, sore, felt like had the flu was considered resolved on 11 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, Bell&#39;s palsy (right eye won&#39;t blink on its own, lip and speech issues) was not recovered. The outcome of the events, light sensitivity, and tearing of right eye was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 50-year-old male patient. The medical history is not provided. The patient experienced a medically significant and unexpected event of Facial paralysis and unexpected non-serious events of Influenza, Pain, Photophobia and Lacrimation increased. The events of Influenza and Pain occurred approximately one day after receiving their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A). Photophobia and Lacrimation increased occurred approximately four days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A). Event of Facial Paralysis was diagnosed approximately ten days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A). Treatment included Valtrex. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                After I got the shot, on the way home, I started feeling tingling on tongue and lips; had a metallic taste. I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

He was observed for 15mins without any noticeable concerns noted. He was scheduled for his 2nd vaccine and released. Member returned to 2nd floor conference room C at 4:37pm as he indicated his tongue felt thick and swallowing wasn&#39;t &#34;natural&#34;. He advised he sat in his car for a while and came back in and took 2 benadryl.  I escorted member down to ACC and handed him off with report. He was in no acute distress, able to talk and ambulate. While checking into ACC he indicated he felt the benadryl was helping and felt a little better. (Initially during the 15 minute observation, member advised his mouth was dry and asked for water, which after drinking he said he was fine and that it helped. He was in no distress at that time. )

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

                                                About 15 minutes after my shot, I began to experience symptoms of an allergic reaction, similar to when I accidentally eat tree nuts. There was a tightness in my chest and a tingling of my lips. I brought this to the pharamacists&#39; attention, and they gave me Benadryl and had me wait at the pharmacy, after making me promise to let them know if things got worse. In the next 15 minutes or so, I experienced additional allergic reaction symptoms, including swelling of the tongue and an itchy rash (although these were relatively minor). About an hour after I got the shot, I felt well enough to drive hom.

Degree of vertigo strong for entire first day undeniably present/persistent and varies (slightly improved, then worsens again) since day 8. Able to get through day but disturbing. Extremely healthy otherwise,  extremely athletically capable.  Nothing unusual in diet or sleep or activity or stress in recent days.  SYMPTOM 2 - Ringing ears on day 11, and increasing on day 12.  This too - never before of any significance in entire life.  Could it be related to the vertigo symptoms?  Feels like it is.  *** Please take note! *** Hard to dismiss as unrelated.  I&#39;m just one.  You have the sample data.  Seems as though auditory/balance nerves are getting a beating somehow.  This is NOT an exasperated pre-existing condition.  The shoulder soreness / tiredness - was a 1 day matter quickly resolved.  This is more insidious and persistent and debilitating.

                                                I had the 2nd shot of Moderna vaccine Monday 5/3 at noon by 3 AM the next morning I had a fever measured 104.5 chills, headache, weak. I tool Tylenol as directed it would only reduce temps to 101 after 2 hours the fever 104 would return. This lasted until late morning the next day my temps started to fall off to 99. Tiredness and headaches still a problem been 3 days since the Moderna 2nd vaccine shot. I also feel some inner ear pressure like some inflammation in there.  The headaches seem to be getting somewhat worse causing me to feel nauseated I took 500 MG of Ibuprofen seems to reduce the headaches. I also developed a cough dry but almost like a flu cough which seems to be resolving.

Was not immediately noticeable and seemed to be more pronounced about 1/2 hour after injection.  I had the other expected soreness at injection site and general malaise approximately 24 hours after  - 96 hours after vaccine and I am only reporting this as I was not expecting the numbness in the tongue and was not sure if it was an adverse effect or just stress related.

                                                So basically I believe I have Bell&#39;s palsy  .  After about an hour after receiving the vaccine I noticed I was having a weird taste in my mouth. Sort of a metallic taste. As the weekend went on it seemed to get worse. Then Monday morning I noticed when brushing my teeth that I wasn?t able to  gurgle my mouth wash. And saw that my mouth and eye seemed to be drooping slightly. Now Thursday the 21st and it seems to be effecting my speech to were I now have a lisp. Can definitely see it when I?m speaking to someone. Which people have commented on.  Not sure what can be done . But at this point I?m hoping it doesn?t get worse. Thanks

                                                Patient began experiencing flushing and tingling sensation in throat/lips about 30 minutes after receiving 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  Patient felt as though throat may have been closing so he administered an epi pen to himself. As no immediate relief patient administered a second epi pen which provided relief. Approximately one hour after vaccination patient felt back to normal and chose to leave the clinic with instructions to report to emergency room if symptoms began to return.

                                                Afew hours after receiving the inoculation, I was extremely sleepy.   I was sleeping at my job, and my boss had me go home early.  I went to work the next day, however I was feeling weird, my sense of smell and taste were off, as the day continued I started having a headache, body aches, and general malaise.  I went home early, again from work.  But when I arrived to my residence I was having severe chills despite my efforts to try to keep myself warm.  The chills lasted for more than 24hrs, preventing me from sleeping, my body aches were getting worse, my eyes were extremely red, and I did not feel like eating.  Near the end of the day, the chills became sweats, and I was trying to balance between being hot and clammy, to chills.  The next day I paid a visit to my primary care doctor.  I was tested for covid - which was negative, I was tested for the flu - which was negative, and my lungs were clear so there was no reason for my doctor to believe I have a pneumonia.

On Saturday 1/23/21 I woke up with hives on my left arm and chest and a swelling on my left eye.  I took benadryl which had no effect. The next day the hives had progressed to blisters, my hand swelled  and my eye had almost swollen shut.  I contacted my health care advisers and they prescribed predinosne.  This reversed the reaction and the wounds are healing.  I have pictures of how I looked.

                                                On Saturday, January 30, 2021 I began experiencing an altered sense of taste with a metallic taste all through my mouth and tingling in my mouth.  I mostly felt ill throughout the day with low-grade fever, fatigue, body aches.  This continued on Sunday, January 31, 2021 and Sunday evening, I noticed a small droop in the upper lip on the right side of my mouth.  When I awakened, Monday, February 1, 2021, I had full right-side paralysis of the face, severe right eye, right jaw and right ear pain, severe fatigue, continued body aches.  After going to the ER where tests were performed to rule out stroke and sepsis, I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                I had a really bad day after the second dose. Horrible migraine headache that built as the day moved on.  As a rule, I do not get migraines and whenever I have gotten a headache I&#39;ve not had a  sensitivity to light or sound, like I did yesterday.  It was just miserable. Lots of body ache and a generalized feeling of sickness, similar to influenza or food poisoning.  I had no energy.   My arm at the injection site hurt constantly without even being touched all day and I could not sleep on my left side due to arm pain around the injection site. The arm pain from the injection site, occasionally radiated to my elbow joint , depending on how I moved my arm.  It is still sensitive today, two days later, and has a sensitive swelling in the area where the injection occurred. I do not feel bad today, but I do feel like I am 100% yet, either, but I feel a LOT better than I did yesterday.

CT scans were inconclusive so I was transferred (9:45 PM 2/25/21), admitted and an MRI scheduled for 24 hours later. MRI (12:00 AM 2/27/21) was negative for stroke. Beginning stages of Bells Palsy was diagnosed. Prescribed Prednisone, Lipitor, Valtrex,  and baby aspirin upon discharge 1:45 PM 2/27/21).  By 2/28/21  symptoms had increased to the point where I can not suck through a straw, speaking is difficult and overall, extreme loss of muscle control in my face and feel like I have a bad head cold.

Left arm at injection site sore.  Details:  approximately 1 am I woke up with chills, headache, earache and tiredness.    I took Tylenol and this continued waking up again a few hours later the same.   Eventually I felt very hot.   Upon waking again tired/fatigue, headache, earache.   At approximately 11:30 am I got out of bed,  shaky &amp; very tired.   I eventually felt better, just tired.   (With exception of Arm still hurting).    Please note I had Covid in December and had similar symptoms, except these all hit me at the same time and felt much worse then when I had Covid.

                                                I have had Tinnitus (Ringing Ears) for several years but it has generally been mild and tolerable. A couple of days after the first dose I noticed my ears were ringing more then usual. It has been very annoying and bothersome. I am very concerned if they will continue ringing this loudly. I am not going to get the 2nd dose. I am very much hoping as the vaccine wears off that my ears will get better.

Congestion progressed to what we thought was an ear infection or sinus infection that had gone to the ear. Was treated on March 28 with Prednisone dose pack.

I am unable to get the lot number of the vaccine because it was entered through the state  system and the lot number did not go over. No lot number is associated with the vaccine.

It hurt on the back right and above the right ear. It hurt to touch. My tongue is not functjioning now.  I had to get a MRI because they thought it could of been a mini stroke. MRI came back negative the doctors told me Bell Palsy.  They advise me not to get my second dose on 2/3/21.

                                                I received first Moderna vaccine shot (Lot # 011L20A) on Jan 6, 2021 and received second Moderna vaccine shot (031L20A) on Feb 3, 2021 at approx. 2:15pm Approximately 36 hours later, at 2am last night while sleeping, the left side of mouth (upper &amp; lower lips) swelled up for unknown reason(s).   I ate dinner at approx. 6pm, and had salad, steak and green beans, all of which I have eaten before without any side effects I don&#39;t believe it is a food allergy and I have not experience any trauma to my lips or face.  At approximately 5:30am, I took 2 Benadryl, in an attempt to reduce swelling.  As of 8am, the swelling is still evident.  Other than swollen lips, only other reaction to shot is minor soreness by the injection site in my left arm.  I am not sure if there is a correlation between the vaccine and my swollen lips, but I&#39;ve never had swollen lips before. Only other reason, for the swelling,  I could think of would by possible spider bite but I feel that is unlikely. If swelling persists, I will contact my doctor.

                                                Patient had usual post vaccination myalgias and lethargy for a few days after injection.  These resolved spontaneously.  However, about a week after vaccination he developed recurrent fevers 102°F.  He also had complaints of body aches and bilateral jaw pain.  He had extensive evaluation including laboratory testing for infectious etiologies of his fever and none was identified.  He was noted to have very high sed rate and CRP.  When no specific etiology for his fevers could be identified we decided to proceed with a short course of prednisone which did seem to help his fever and jaw pain.  After prednisone was stopped he had recurrence of fever and developed worse jaw pain and pain at the base of his neck. I examined him in clinic and found that he had a tender swollen thyroid.  I directed him to the emergency department where CT scanning of his neck confirmed evidence of thyroiditis.  TSH was undetectable and free T4 was about 2 times higher than normal.  He was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis.  However, his symptomatology seemed quite dramatic for subacute thyroiditis, and the timing in relation to his vaccination is concerning for possible adverse vaccine reaction.

                                                after about 30 minutes, I started having a metallic taste in my mouth.  I was also experiencing soreness in left arm area.   After about an hour, the pain in my arm started to feel as though it was spreading to my left chest cavity area.  I then started to get chest pains in the left breast area to the armpit area, but not severe, just concerning.  After probably 70-80 minutes, I started feeling drowsy.  I continued to feel drowsy all evening and did not sleep well.  I woke up and could not return to sleep at 4:45am.  My normal waking time is 6:00am.  I had/have quite a bit of soreness in my arm, but nothing unbearable.  No signs of rash or inflammation around injection sight.  I am taking a sick day from work to relax and recover from loss of sleep.  The metallic taste persist, but only an annoyance and taste seems to be normal when eating or drinking.  A slight achiness in joints, but a cold front was also moving in, which can cause me to have the same effect.

                                                In the afternoon, I experienced a nosebleed.  The weather was not overly dry, I was well-hydrated, and I was confused why I would experience a nosebleed.  The bleed was not excessive, and I considered coincidence.  An hour or two later in the late afternoon, my wife noticed that I had a ruptured capillary in my left eye.  She was very concerned since it appeared very bloody even though it did not cause me any significant pain.  The affected eye was mildly itchy afterward.  I was not hit in the eye or scratched it in any way.  I associated the capillary bleeding events as related to each other and potentially related to my vaccination.  However, both events were minor and passed, cleared up in 72 hours.  I have a photo of my eye that is available upon request.

                                                I received the first  shot on March 16th and on March 20th around 4:00 pm I was feeling like my speech was a little slurry.  I got home and about 5:30 pm I was resting against my boat cause I was feeling nausea and a headache.  Also it felt like my food tasted different...I had ate some chips the day after the shot on March 17th and I had told my wife that they tasted different.  Anyway, on  March 20th around 8:30 pm I went to spit and realized I could only spit from the right side of my mouth. I called my daughter, who is an ICU RN, asked me to do a series of tests over facetime with her and she told me I should go in cause when I smiled it wasn&#39;t symmetrical.  She came and picked me up and took me to hospital in.  Immediately there they asked me to smile and to raise my eyebrows and they treated for &#34;possible&#34; stroke.

I should add to the other that my blood pressure has elevated since the vaccine.  As part of going on medication on 3/18, it was a concern the medications would elevate my blood pressure.  I bought a wrist BP check device and it was averaging 134/95 on 3/22/2021.  On 3/23/2021, I was prescribed Losartan.  I took one pill at 7:30PM.  Today when I woke up and for most of the day the BP has been 124/77-82.  The ringing remains persistent

Next morning quite achy, strong headache, light sensitive. No breathing or cognition issues. Not eating but no g.i. issues. Injection site is sore.  Mostly recovered or anyway not worried about lingering symptoms at 20 hours past shot (if something gets worse I&#39;ll report again). My goal in submitting this report was only to describe  what I consider to be note-worthy side effects. By comparison, I had a first covid  vaccine dose exactly 1 month ago and no real signs. Also, I had covid-19 infection, moderately sick, in March 2020 (tested pos for covid antibodies in May 2020.

                                                I got the shot at 3pm. I started feeling &#34;off&#34; in stomach/chest around 7-8pm. By 3am, my stomach/chest did not feel good at all and I had trouble sleeping. It was definitely not heart related. By 8am I felt chills coming on. By 9am I was fully dressed, with two blankets on, and lying on couch shaking for 20-30 minutes. Later a fever started and it reached about 102.3 before subsiding late afternoon. By 8pm, I felt blah but fever was gone. During that entire time I felt achy overall (similar to what I felt like 2 hours after running a marathon).  I didn&#39;t have headaches (and rarely do), but area around my eyes were heavy and tired. Weirdly, at times, the top 1/2 of both ears hurt.   I experience about every symptom I had as when I had Covid and went to hospital for 26 days except for the breathing issues.

                                                started with tingling in left neck and up to face.  Talked to the nurse and she said that this can be a common side effect as the powder mixed with the liquid is cold.  If i have more troubles let her know.    After my 35 minutes I left wondering if my lips feeling funny.  i drove 12 miles to my school and went straight to the nurse as my lips were swelling up.  My throat and tongue ok.  I took Benadryl and then hubby picked me up and we went straight to ER.  On the way to hospital my tongue started to feel thick on the left side as we were only blocks away.   Immediately they took great care of me!  They gave my Epi pen shot, steriod and more Benadryl.   I left 3 hours later.  Came home and taking Benadryl as still slight numbness on left lip.   Throat and Tongue great.

                                                about 12 hours after receiving injection began getting aches in arm, head and body. Aches became very strong overnight. Headache was very strong and the type that caused ringing in ears. Overnight got strong chills and fever. These side effects lasted approximately 12 hours. Knowing they were side effects from the vaccine kept me from going to the doctor. These side effects were eerily similar to symptoms I had when I was ill out of the country in Spring 2019. The strong aches, chills and fever were identical. With the very low COVID cases in that country currently, it makes me think that I potentially had a similar coronavirus in 2019, and potentially that is why cases are low in those countries now since the virus may have already done its damage in those countries.

This all happened within 5-10 minutes. The arm started to feel sore then all of the above happened about 15 min. after the arm starting to hurt. After running water over my face and back of neck, I sat down. The side effects slowly went away.  The entire incident took about 15-20 minutes. This was also about 4 hours after the first vaccine.

                                                I suffer from tinnitus (ear ringing) originally caused (as best as I can tell) from Aleve and Advil.  It was made worse a few years ago by taking Viagra.  The volume of ringing went up a small amount shortly after taking the medicine, although I attributed that to stress.  However, at roughly the 3-week mark the volume increased dramatically and included pressure in the ear canal.  Imagine the pressure when sitting in an aircraft at takeoff.  The pressure varied over the next day or so but the volume remained at the same high level.  I saw the nurse-practitioner at the doctor&#39;s office 2 days later.  He suspects allergies and is not terribly concerned but said I should see the ENT.  I have an appointment with her in early June.    Every other time the volume has tweaked up like this for more than a few hours it has been permanent.  The last time I went for a full hearing test with the ENT (2015) I was told this is a symptom of hearing damage and there is nothing they can do for me.   I am very afraid to take the 2nd shot - the sound is almost at the level of pain.  I&#39;m not sure I can cope with it being much louder, it has gone from being annoying and bothersome to intrusive.  I have canceled my shot #2 appointment for 4/08/21.

                                                About 12 hours after getting the second Moderna dose, while trying to sleep, my heart rate was 100-110, with the feeling of repeated PVCs in my heart.  I knew this feeling because I had dealt with episodes of repeated PVCs (and later PACs) from about 2016 to February 2020.  After being in the hospital in February 2020 for life-threatening sepsis, pneumonia, and strep, the arrhythmias stopped completely.  I had been trying to control the episodes by taking atenolol 25mg/d; upon realizing that the PVC episodes had stopped, I terminated the medication.  So at about 1AM on 3/7/2021 or so, I noticed the PVCs and the rapid heart rate and could not sleep.  Fever went up to 102.4, thirsty and possibly dehydrated. Went to ER at 7am.  Tests showed repeated PVCs.  Kidney function was slightly abnormal.  Started taking atenolol through Tuesday, 3/9.  Heart monitor halter showed PVCs continued through Tuesday.  By Thursday, 3/11, it was apparent that the PVCs had stopped and heart rate was normal.  I stopped the atenolol and the irregular heartbeat has not returned.

                                                Face was drooping; Loss of taste; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning, a 58-year-old, male  patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced loss of taste/ageusia and face drooping/facial paralysis.   The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID-19 approximately six months prior to this event. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 09 Jan 2021, approximately 3 days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Jan 2021, after receiving mRNA-1273, the patient experienced loss of taste buds. On 20 Jan 2021 patient noticed that his face &#34;felt funny&#34; while drinking water and went to the mirror where he saw the right side of his face was drooping. Patient was seen by PCP on 25 Jan 2021.  Treatment for the events included high dose steroid therapy and valacyclovir 1 gm by mouth twice daily for ten days.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The outcome of the events, ageusia and face dropping, were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Further information has been requested.

                                                Woke up Sunday morning with extremely swollen lip. Made virtual doctors appointment with picture of lip.  They said get to ER immediately bc i was having an allergic reaction to my blood pressure medicine Lisinopril even though i have been on it for almost 20 years.   When i got to unspecified Hospital they started me on an IV but the swelling would not go down.  They said they had to admit me for the night to continue  steroid treatments.   The doctors were not sure if  it was related to the Moderna shot i had 8 days prior.  I went to my primary care doctor who put me on a different BP med but was very sure it was from the shot.  After one day at unspecified hospital all the swelling was down and i was released .

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

I sat on the edge of the tub. After a couple of minutes I went to get up and fainted on the floor.  My BP was 89/49 with a pulse of 86bpm. I was helped off the floor and back to bed where I lay with my feet elevated by a couple of pillows. No further issues at this time.

                                                &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34;  Injection day Saturday March 13th no problems at all, everything was good all day.  I woke up on Sunday morning 8am March 14th with a pretty moderate headache. I didn&#39;t feel good all day and took several naps unable to lose my headache. About 3pm March 14th I had a slight pain in my left eye and developed &#34;floaters&#34;, a lot of them. I decided to take a nap and woke up 1 hour later with less floaters but I had like marble streaks in my left eye vision and about 10 minutes of flashing lights in my left corner eye, not severe though.  My eye looks normal looking in the mirror, nothing looks unusual.  Tonight the same day March 14th, 11pm before bedtime less floaters, I can only see one. The marble streak in my vision appears to be a black streak now when I look down at a white counter top.  I can make it move from left to right when looking at the counter top but I do not have any pain.  I am not sure what to do but I just wanted to let someone know that I encountered a side effect from the vaccine or it could be a coincidence, I have never had this problem before though.

He said it wasn&#39;t there until he received the vaccine. I examined his arm for redness, swelling, signs of a reaction. There was none. I also screened him for symptoms of anaphylaxis and he had none. I checked on him several times and before he left, he said the taste was &#34;better&#34; and said he had no other symptoms.

It went away within an hour and I worked a full 8 hour day. By the time I got home it was full blown double vision. I attended urgent care who diagnosed me &#34;Cranial Nerve 4 palsy.&#34; I was recommended to see an opthomologist who confirmed this. I wasn&#39;t comfortable with this and asked to see a neurologist who also said cranial nerve 4 palsy. I asked for a brain MRI as I felt something more was going on. The MRI shown no abnormal findings (done 3/11/2021). On 3/16/2021 I woke up with a drooping eyelid of left eye. I immediately called opthomologist who suggested a diagnosis of Myesthenia Gravis. This was confirmed by neurologist on 3/23/2021. I am now on Prednisone and Mestinon. My next plan is to see a MG Specialist at A referral has been sent to them by my neurologist.

                                                Not sure if above lot number is correct, their handwriting was messy.  But I experienced a 10 fold increase in my Tinnitus.  My Tinnitus before the shot was very mild and most time un-noticeable.  I thought it would decrease over time but did not.  I had to find an ENT doctor and make an appointment.  I scheduled an appointment and they requested a hearing test before seeing me on 04/20.  My hearing test seems to indicate progression  in my Tinnitus but I can&#39;t confirm it because I didn&#39;t get a record of my previous hearing test back around 2015.  Saw the doctor and he prescribed Prednisone 20 mg  for 7 days.  I finished the treatment and it seemed to help but did not completely get me back to where I was before the Covid 19 Vaccine shot.   Still have noticeable constant ringing in the ears although know at a lower level than initially.   I will be going in for my 2nd dose of the Moderna Vaccine on 4/30/21 per the advice of my ENT doctor and will have a follow up hearing test and doctor visit the week after the shot.  I will report back if 2nd shot causes additional problems

I had the expected side effects Chills, aches, headache but was not expecting the tinnitus and thought initially it would resolve with the other symptoms but it has not.  It is a constant high pitched tone.  I was not exposed to anything else that day.  No loud noises and have no symptoms other illness.  This is the first time I have experienced this. It doesn&#39;t seem to be in one ear or the other, It is just there , constantly.  I did not go to a doctor because I am one and know nothing can be done.

After 45 minutes the redness abated and I came home,    1 March 2021 I came down with COVID symptoms with dizziness, blurry vision, redness, ringing in the ear and flu like symptoms of body aches.   Then the neuralgia in the dextral ulnar nerve increased and clawing started.  Then same happened on the sinistral ulnar nerve and Carpal tunnel in the other finders.  I feared going to sleep for fear of awaking with paralysis.  I drank vodka to calm myself down and Xanax to sleep (I know it is a dangerous combination).  2 March the red skin continues and when I awoke at 13:30 today I was still extreme and I called 911.  The EMS visited and determined my blood pressure and pulse were normal.  The dextral  ulnar nerve problems continue,

                                                Approximately 25 minutes after shot administered: A single welt/hive appeared on my right thigh approx. 6? above my knee; was warm and raised. Dissipated after 1 hour; Re-appeared around 6 pm but less irritating. Not present today. (Haven?t had any hives in more than a decade.) Roof of mouth and ear canals became very warm and itchy...like an intensifying of my seasonal allergies. Continued to decrease after 7 pm; also used a cold milkshake to relieve the sensation between 5:15 pm and 6:00 pm. Both sides of my tongue swelled and were itchy.  Symptom subsided around 7 pm. Minimal pain at injection site; no redness No fever, no headache.
