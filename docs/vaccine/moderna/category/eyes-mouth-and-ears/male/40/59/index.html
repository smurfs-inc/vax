                                                I received the vaccine 30 min. prior to starting my shift as a Nurse in the ED. About 1 hour after receiving the shot while standing I felt off balance and began to have a vertigo like dizziness. I sat down and tried to drink some water but began spitting the water back up and dry heaving after trying to drink. I did not feel nauseous if I was not drinking. I did feel the sensation of a slight lump in my throat. I did not have any shortness of breath, tachycardia,  rash or fever. I did not want to check in as a patient so I called my wife to come and pick me up from work. Before I left I had the pharmacy send me some Pepcid and Benadryl and I took 25mg of Benadryl and 20mg of Pepcid before leaving. I left work around 1400 and now at 1500 I am able to drink fluids. The slight lump in my throat seems to have improved. I still feel a little dizzy and off balance.

Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

                                                Received first dose of Moderna vaccine on Tuesday 2/23/2021 and began to feel tingling on the right side of my head and an ear ache the next day (Wednesday 2/24/2021). The symptoms got progressively worse over the next few days and on Sunday 2/28/2021 the right side of my face was completely paralyzed. I sought emergency care at Hospital Emergency Room where I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. The doctor who treated me strongly believes that the Bells Palsy was due to the Moderna vaccine. Today (9 days post vaccine) the entire right side of my face continues to be completely paralyzed with no signs of improvement.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

As of today 1/12/21 I am still experiencing symptoms even while using Benadryl allergy tablets by mouth and anti-itch cream applied to the injection site.

The symptoms sided over the last 12 hours of the 36 hours mentioned. A very light state of feeling tired persisted another 24 hrs as well as a slightly elevated temperature (1-1.5 degrees). I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

                                                Within 48 hours of receiving the COVID vaccine, I began having extreme pressure and discomfort in my right ear.  Symptoms included dizziness, fullness in the ear and hearing loss.  This persisted for several days.  As a first course of action, I took Tylenol and antihistamines.   I saw my PCP a few days later and he misdiagnosed my condition and suggested that I continue with antihistamines and Flonase.  Two weeks later my condition had improved only slightly and I became more concerned.  I asked my PCP whether a short course of steroids was warranted (at the suggestion of my mom and wife, who are both health care professionals).  He prescribed a &#34;dose pack,&#34; which I started on or about Monday, Feb. 22.  Later that week, I connected with an ENT  who is a friend of a friend .  When I told him my story and symptoms he was extremely concerned and got me an immediate appointment on Friday, Feb. 26.  At that visit I was diagnosed with acute and severe Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that had resulted in 92% hearing loss in my right ear.   Additional symptoms continue to include fullness, tinnitus and other discomfort.  None of these issues existed prior to my COVID vaccine shot.  I am currently undergoing a treatment of high dose prednisone and steroid injections in my ear.   I am scheduled for another visit with doctor on Friday, March 12.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

                                                He started having a weird feeling in his throat. Felt like tight and closing. He refused to go to ER. Said it wasn?t bad. Came home used inhaler and Benadryl. Next day difficulty breathing, as I had pneumonia he thought he was getting sick. Saturday morning went and got prednisone and new inhaler. Layer down and went to call his name and did not respond. Rolled him over and he was dead. I did CPR until the paramedics arrived. Placed on life support due to heart beat back. Had very little brain activity. Due to he could not get oxygen into his body. On March 23 turned off life support and he died. He was completely normal no flair ups until he received this shot.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 23 Dec 2020, approximately four days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20-2A) intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 27 Dec 2020, the patient experienced decreased vision.  On 29 Dec 2020, the physician examined the patient. There was some retinal hemorrhage, venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion. Lab work was requested by the physician and results were pending. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events, loss of vision, decreased vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a  46 year old male patient. The patient&#39;s medical history is not provided. The patient experienced a serious, unexpected event of loss of vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade  central retinal occlusion. The event occurred 4 days after first dose of the mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information are required for further assessment.

Got epi 0.3 mg IM, Decadron 10 mg IV, Zyrtec 10 mg, Pepcid 40 mg po, Benadryl 25 mg po, with improvement.  Allergy consulted, felt this was likely delayed hypersensitivity reaction to Moderna, but couldn&#39;t exclude lisinopril side effect.  They recommended Zyrtec 10 mg bid for 1 wk, and stay off lisinopril.  Will follow up in Clinic to determine how to approach 2nd shot.

I could not open my eye (room stopped spinning) until 3am the next morning.  I could not stand without losing my balance until 12 noon.  Treatment - I took meclizine 25mg at 12 midnight, 2am and 7am. Outcome - vertigo stopped around 3am, equilibrium returned at 12 noon and i was able to stand and walk slowly at that time.

I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence.

The patient developed headache, lack of taste, fatigue as well as the aforementioned rash on 1/14/2021(6 days after receiving first dose of covid vaccine.  A rapid covid test was positive on 1/14/2021 also.  The patient was prescribed claritin, methylprednisolone for the rash after seeing his family physician virtually and the family physician recommended he contact where he was vaccinated to report these symptoms.  I have reached out to the patient for additional information and he has declined, so I do not have any access to details on his positive covid test or records from that virtual encounter.

He was observed for 15mins without any noticeable concerns noted. He was scheduled for his 2nd vaccine and released. Member returned to 2nd floor conference room C at 4:37pm as he indicated his tongue felt thick and swallowing wasn&#39;t &#34;natural&#34;. He advised he sat in his car for a while and came back in and took 2 benadryl.  I escorted member down to ACC and handed him off with report. He was in no acute distress, able to talk and ambulate. While checking into ACC he indicated he felt the benadryl was helping and felt a little better. (Initially during the 15 minute observation, member advised his mouth was dry and asked for water, which after drinking he said he was fine and that it helped. He was in no distress at that time. )

                                                Dizziness started in the early morning approximately 12 hours after vaccination. The sx&#39;s come in waves and affect my balance. Sx&#39;s are sometimes exacerbated by change in position and first occurred whenever I rolled over in bed. The sx&#39;s also occurred while sitting at a desk working on my computer.  No benefit from Eply&#39;s maneuvers. No nystagmus with Dix Hallpike maneuver.  Meclizine seemed to be helpful. Sx&#39;s have persisted this morning, 1/4/2020.

                                                I began to experience lightheadedness, generalized weakness and confusion. My handwriting changed. These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.
