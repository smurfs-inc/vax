Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

There is a charlie horse like feeling in my left cheek, which is now also present in my left jaw. The left side of my tongue is numb with slight pain, and my bottom lip is numb on the left side, and the feeling stops at the middle like there were a line drawn down my face.  My upper left cheek and the side of my left eye have a constant,  moderate burning feeling.  The shot was in my left arm.  The Dr. at urgent care said it was not a stroke, so that&#39;s good.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  It has now been over 13 hours.

                                                The shot was administered in my left arm.  I experienced localized swelling and axillary lymph node tenderness immediately after injection under my left armpit.  The right side of my face also became numb for about 5 minutes.  The next morning the areas around my eyes were swollen and I had two styes in my right eye.  I do not know if these were related.  These symptoms lasted approximately 3 days.  Some minimal swelling and tenderness seemed to remain, and approximately a week later I experienced a painful resurgence of the swelling at the injection site that was far larger, harder and more painful.  I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen.  These relieved the symptoms within 48 hours.

He said he felt like his head was being compressed. His lower lip began to feel numb and tingly, eventually this feeling spread into his mouth and throat. He was coherent the entire time. He received oral Benadryl while waiting for his wife to arrive to drive him to the emergency room.

I didn&#39;t think much of it but it stayed slightly irritated. About 1am, as I prepared for bed, it had become red and was quite irritated. I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night and my eye was quite irritated and it was filled with tears. The next two days it remained irritated in this way, red and painful. As of now (over 48 hours later), it is still red and irritated.

The symptoms got progressively worse over the next few days and on Sunday 2/28/2021 the right side of my face was completely paralyzed. I sought emergency care at Hospital Emergency Room where I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. The doctor who treated me strongly believes that the Bells Palsy was due to the Moderna vaccine. Today (9 days post vaccine) the entire right side of my face continues to be completely paralyzed with no signs of improvement.

                                                Acute hearing loss in right ear. Muffled, ringing sound one day after vaccine administered. Was sleeping and heard a high pitched sound from right ear. Waited several weeks for it to clear up. Finally went to my PCP and was started on steroids. That did not help. Saw an ENT specialist and restarted on another round of steroids.

                                                Patient received vaccine at 3:15 pm on 3/12/21 and stayed in pharmacy area for 15 min (he left feeling fine). After about an hour 4:15 he showed back up at the pharmacy telling our pharmacy technician that he lost his voice and his throat was closing. She rushed him to the waiting room where I, pharmacist, came out and asked him what was going on. He stated he was with a client and suddenly lost his voice, and felt his throat starting to close. I asked if he was having trouble breathing and he said yes because his throat was closing and his whole arm was tingling. I had him take his mask down and try to take a few deep breaths first. I asked for permission to administer an Epi-pen which he gave verbal consent. 911 was called. Patient stated he did not want 911 called because he was going to refuse service.  After a min or so patient stated his throat was back open and he was feeling good. I informed him paramedics are on their way and he needed to stay in the waiting room because effects of the EpiPen can wear off in 15 min.  I stayed with him and watched until paramedics arrived. Paramedics sat with him and he did refuse service (they did take his blood pressure).  When paramedics asked the patient about when he came in they asked if he was having trouble breathing and he responded &#34;no I could breathe, my voice was just hoarse&#34; (which is the opposite of what he told the technician and myself). He also sounded like it was very hard to breathe. I did information to the paramedics after saying that he told us his throat was closing of which they stated that they figured that was the case and they knew the patient and assumed he would refuse service.   Patient was in contact with his primary care doctor who told him he could go home if his BP was ok but to make sure he had someone to drive him home.  Patient had his wife come to get him and they left.

Within few hours, developed dry cough and later slight fever, runny nose, and pimple like on the back of the tongue.  Bleed start when scraping the tongue after brushing teeth.  One week later on Sunday 2.21 the coughing started and stay consistent (over the counter cough and flu med did not do anything) until the week of 2nd dose...Called doctor on March 9, 2021 with chronic dry coughing.  I had concerns abt 2nd dose due date but he approved and told me to take allergy med and prescribed  benzonatate.  The benzonatate was useless against the cough and only the allergy helped stopped the coughing!

He was complaining of trouble with focusing his eyes, left sided chest pain, and was diaphoretic.  Pt appeared to be in moderate distress and very anxious. I examined the pt through the car window and listened to his heart and lungs. Pt was not in respiratory distress and heart rate and rhythm were regular. Reassurance was provided to the pt, but he was also told that to be safe I recommended that he be evaluated in the emergency department and that he be transported via ambulance. Pt expressed understanding and agreed to going to the ED but was refusing transport via EMS. Pt was the passenger in the vehicle and he said that the driver could just take him. I expressed that transport via EMS would be the safest but we could not make him go via EMS and that if they wanted to leave via private vehicle then they could but i still recommended that he be evaluated in the ED. He expressed understanding and that he would go directly to the ED via personal car.

                                                A little less than 3 hours after getting the shot, I noticed the injection site was getting very sore. Within about a half hour of first noticing it, that entire muscle was aching a lot. It?s now 4:50pm and it hurts to lift my arm, reach for anything, I can even feel it just by typing this out. I?ve also noticed I?m pretty tired, my joints feel very achey like when I have a cold, and I?m incredibly thirsty. The pain in the muscle at injection site is by far the worst symptom though. It?s extremely painful. I did not expect that since it didn?t hurt when getting the actual shot. Took my temp and it?s normal. The aching joints are far less painful than my arm, but are an issue nonetheless. Had I known this would happen beforehand, I would still get the shot, so as long as it doesn?t get a lot worse or something else haplens, all in all I?d have to say it was worth it.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

                                                Two days after receiving my 2nd dose, I began experiencing tinnitus in my right ear. It sounds like a low, rumbling, &#34;whooshing&#34; sound that intensifies when hearing sounds with low/bass frequencies. So far, I&#39;ve tried treating it by flushing out my ear and applying ear drops, but it has not been effective.

The volume of the ringing had reduced during the day, but it was constant until the evening when it went away.   On 4/12/21, I had woken up to the ringing again and has been constant in both ears ever since and still continues to this day, 4/26/21.  It is very noticeable and a loud high pitch ringing that occasionally seems to vary in volume, but still very unnerving as it has been almost 2 weeks of constant tinnitus.

His arm felt sore as if somebody hit him several times, very sore.  I felt sick, felt queasy, nauseous wanting to vomit but did not.  He felt really tired, fatigued because he didn&#39;t get any sleep that night.  He went all day feeling terrible, nauseous, felt like being through the ringer an flushed, which went on for 2-3 days.  He now feels a lot better, but felt like he was getting the flu.  He did not take anything for it and did take some medicine to help him sleep and did get a lot of rest and sleep.  He did drink a lot of liquids to keep his throat lubricated.  He also did have a throbbing headache, which he normally does not get headaches and felt terrible.  He did take some aspirin for that.  The symptoms have all resolved and feels perfectly fine now.     Stated that he has never felt so bad in his life.

                                                I developed pulsatile tinnitus in my right ear about 24 hours after the shot. Didn&#39;t think it was a big deal at first but it came back every evening and even now my ear still feels weird all the time even when the whooshing goes away. For about three weeks it came back nearly every night now it just happens on random nights. I didn&#39;t get my second shot because I didn&#39;t want to risk making it worse.   I am very-much a vaccine advocate but I think it&#39;s strange that I never hear anything about tinnitus as a common symptom. When I went looking I immediately found a TON of anecdotal evidence of the Moderna vaccine causing tinnitus from people stories almost exactly like mine. More should be done to understand this.

Didn&#39;t think anything of it, Monday my right eye began to water like crazy. Didn&#39;t think anything of it. Tuesday morning I had a hard time eating breakfast because I couldn&#39;t open my mouth wide enough and was hitting my bottom lip with my teeth. i thought it was strange but didn&#39;t think anything of it. Took a shower about 11;30 and when I looked in the mirror I notice the ride side of my face was not responding like the left side, I called my doctors office and they got me right in. After a brief consultation they called ER and told me I would be on my way. I checked into ER at about 1;30pm.

                                                3 days post vaccine awoke with severe tinnitus. Tinnitus has persisted ever since.  Sleep now requires interventions  such as melatonin and sound masking  to overcome sounds of tinnitus.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included diabetes. Concomitant medications were insulin glargine and insulin lispro.  The patient said he was compliant with his insulin injections.  On 29 Dec 2020 , prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 29 Dec 2020, the patient experienced a spike in blood sugar.  He tested his blood sugar immediately following the vaccination and it was in the 280-380 range.  Prior to the vaccine, it was 100 to 150.  On an unspecified date, his hemoglobin A1C was below 7.  On 05 Jan 2021, he experienced hearing impairment &#34;whoosh&#34;.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient experienced complete vision loss.    On 11 Jan 2021, he experienced blurred vision.     Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event of complete vision loss resolved on 11 Jan 2021.  The outcomes of the events of fatigue, blurred vision, hearing impairment &#34;whoosh&#34;, and blood sugar spike were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of diabetes remains a confounding factor. Further information has been requested.

As the next few days started to progress I started noticing mild muscle spasms all over my body, mostly in my legs; waking up in the middle of the night, dry mouth, night sweat (1 occurrence), sudden onset of rapid and irregular heart beat (1 occurrence); kidney pain (right and left), upper abdominal pain (right and left). Prior to vaccine I did not experience any of these events.

All resolved by 4pm Wednesday March 31st but my eyesight is getting progressively worse. I cant read anything on the TV.

On Saturday my arm was still sore so took some more Ibuprofen. Sunday I was feeling fine until about 8 pm when I started to get a little dizzy.  On Monday when I woke up I could barely raise my head. Everything was spinning. I was very dizzy and my mouth was dry. I had no concept of time. 2 mins would feel like 2 hours and 2 hour could feel like 2 mins. I started to feel a little better around 4 pm. Today I still feel a little hazy in the head.

                                                Muscle twitching in calf muscles begain immediately after injection. Muscle twitching in right calf muscle continued for 11 hours before subsiding.  Increase in tinnitus level 7 hours later; tinnitus likely at higher baseline level weeks later. Two small spots of petechiae developed on left arm five days later: one spot on shoulder, other spot underneath bicep.

                                                Approximately 54 hours after receiving shot I noticed a couple hives on the lower portion of my body.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and went to bed around 10pm.  I woke up around 1am on 3/20 and noticed that my lips were very swollen and I had several hives on the lower half of my body.  Additionally my scrotum was enlarged.  Other than the physical symptoms I felt fine - no fever, body aches, pain, or respiratory issues.  I decided to go back to bed after taking 2 Advil.  I woke up at 7am and was still having a reaction so I decided to go to the ER.  While at the ER the gave me steroid and Benadryl which immediately started working to reduce the reaction.  They took blood work which came back &#34;essentially perfect&#34; according to the Dr.  I was discharged and prescribed an epipen, and a steroid which i took for two days.  I was instructed to follow up with my primary care physician which I did on 3/26.  The ER Dr believed that my reaction was caused by something that i had ate; however, to the best of my knowledge, I am NOT allergic to any foods.  Shortly before the reaction I had eaten a can of ravioli and some bread.  The can from a 12 pack that we bought at the grocery store approximately 6 months ago.  It as the last can in the pack and I did not have a reaction to any of the previous cans.  I met with my family Dr&#39;s PA the following week and she indicated that while there is no way to know with 100% confidence that the reaction was from the shot, she noted that it was highly unlikely that my reaction was from the ravioli can.  The PA informed me that I needed to use extra caution should I decide to get the second shot.  I am scheduled to receive the second shot on 4/14.

                                                I?ve been vaccinated for 2 months now. My new symptoms just started to really ramp up 3 weeks ago. Of course I had the initial symptoms of being sick for 2 and 1/2 days after my second shot?.but recently it started with leg aches and then it matriculated up into my upper body. My legs have since become less achy per say. Now it?s my upper body and mostly in my shoulders (more in the one I received the shots in), back pain, and general fatigue. Currently still dealing with the upper body ache discomfort, cold hands and feet but I noticed that I have a slight headache always and my vision has became a little blurry in one eye. The headache severity is day to day but what?s interesting now is I?m having ear ringing and sensitivity to sound. Headache seems to emulate from the back of my skull and the crown of my head. The other lingering piece is the fatigue after doing activities. I?m an active guy and recently my body gets really achy after I do anything super strenuous and I get tired. Also feeling a little shaky, some rapid heart rate, and some circulation issues in my legs and arms. Note; never experienced these issues before the Vaccine aside from the normal wear and tear of an active lifestyle.

After I took my first dose of the vaccine the tinnitus became much louder and noticeable and is still very loud. I did not have a noticeable increase after my second dose of the vaccine. It stayed consistent throughout.

Then I felt fine for about 12 hours after the shot (1st moderna shot on 1/21/21, 2nd moderna shot on 06/02/21). About 9:00 pm I had soreness in my arm and body aches. By 2 am on 6/3, the body aches were extreme, along with chills, and a low fever 99-100. The headache that followed lasted hours and was terrible. I had not been sick, or felt sick, in more than a year, and experienced only a sore arm with the first shot. The after affects from the second shot were terrible and I am afraid and anxious. I hope I don&#39;t die.

                                                Tinnitus in right ear since getting vaccine. I got the shot in the right arm as well (may be unrelated). Unable to sleep with tinnitus. Nausea and little appetite, losing weight. All started the day I received the vaccine. There are days when tinnitus is lower level and no nausea, but it returns. Still like this almost 2 months later.

                                                Sudden fast heart/pounding  rate about 30 min after vaccination. Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

As of today 1/12/21 I am still experiencing symptoms even while using Benadryl allergy tablets by mouth and anti-itch cream applied to the injection site.

The symptoms sided over the last 12 hours of the 36 hours mentioned. A very light state of feeling tired persisted another 24 hrs as well as a slightly elevated temperature (1-1.5 degrees). I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

Felt normal within 48 hours.

                                                3 minutes after vaccination the patient began to feel a tingling and pain in his arm where the vaccine was placed.  Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

                                                On the first day I had a huge lump underneath my armpit I did not become too concerned with that I read it was something that could happen regarding the lymph node. 10 days later I woke up at 3:30 in the morning and had to dial 911 my throat felt like it was closing and my lips were both swollen. I went in the ambulance they brought me to the emergency room where they gave me Benadryl a steroid and some IV fluids. as soon as I receive the Benadryl my throat started to open up and my lips both started to go down . My lip continue to swell for the next three days on and off often on. Every time it swelled up I took Benadryl and every time sure enough it went away . The day I came home from the hospital I thought I was doing much better until that following night I became severely nauseous. I don?t know if it was something that they had given me in the hospital or still a reaction that was going on in my body, but I had some sort of stomach bug I threw up that whole day, had chills sweats  and a pounding headache that would not go away for over 48 hours .I was unable to eat or drink for 24 hours and had to go to an urgent care where they provided me with some medication for nausea. My concern right now is I am hearing that the second shot hits a lot harder than the first one and if this was a reaction to the shot I am very afraid of what will go on if I get the second one.  I cannot take a chance with my life.  I really want to shot I work in an environment where I am working with the department  which is why I was able to get the vaccine so early I feel safe being vaccinated I am very disappointed that this happened I just cannot take a chance having a family etc. Also I have very bad medical in Sherance so I am dealing with all of the bills from this hospital stay I have a  deductible which I can?t afford and then only 50% is covered afterwards. That is the reason I do not go to the hospital under no circumstance unless I am dying which that night I was that scared I felt the need I had to go.

Mother took him to the doctor who diagnosed him with Bell&#39;s Palsy.   Dr. prescribed Prednisone and Valacyclovir for these symptoms.  He still has some drooping of his eye and mouth, but doctor said it may take a couple of weeks.  He does have blurry vision due to this as well.  The injection site itself has no problems.   He has a FU next week with his doctor.

                                                I was driving on the highway and experienced numbness starting in my lips.  This numbness then moved throughout my body into my limbs.  I had some mobility and was able to pull off of the highway down an exit but at one point, I could not lift my legs or control my hands.  I called 911 but it was very difficult to do so with the numbness.  I then started to regain my mobility but had some continued numbness around the left side of my mouth.  The paramedics tested my vitals and everything came back as normal.    They recommended that I have someone come pick me up. So I had a neighbor come pick me up and someone drive my car home.  I did not lose any vision or mental capacity throughout this.  It was just a wave of numbness throughout my entire body.  It lasted 5-10 minutes but felt like an eternity. I am lucky to be alive and to not have crashed my vehicle into someone or something.

On way home my lips started to tingle a bit and I felt warmer over my body. I got home and felt exhausted for multiple days but on the first day I could not sleep. By the weekend I was just worn out and slept all day the following Sat and Sunday.  My arm hurt so bad I couldn?t lay on it and I even  today either have phantom arm pain or real arm pain. But I know where the shot was because I feel it. It still feels like a deep tissue bruise.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  Apart from the fatigue, sore arm and feverishness I had on the day of the vaccination, I woke the next day with what looked like Subconjunctival hemorrhage in my right eye. It was a bright red spot in my cornea and both my eyes were sore.   Since then, the hemorrhage has spread within my right eye. My eyes are still sore and I get a sharp/shooting pain in my right eye intermittently. I also feel some soreness in my right temple and under the ear.

                                                On March 30th I lost taste on half of my mouth. When I woke up March 31 my entire right side of my face was dropping and was not responsive to facial motion. Went to the ER to get checked out. They did testing to make sure to rule out a stroke. And found it to be Bell?s Palsy. I was given a prescription of steroids ,  antibiotic, and eye ointment. I was told to go for a follow up with my Family doctor. I have that scheduled for April 5th at 3:15pm with Dr.. I have had to miss two days of work so far due to this adverse side effect.

Very sore arm at injection site.

He had full conciousness, only loss of sight and difficulty hearing for about 5 minutes. I took his BP while he was seated, 104/54 (he reports a normal BP around ~110/60).  He sat until he regained sight and drank a full bottle of water. I continued to watch him for an additional 15 minutes and retook his BP= 116/58. Patient informed to call the pharmacy at any time for questions, follow up, etc. Full recovery, patient reports being fine and went about his day.

                                                I developed a decent case of tinnitus in my left ear today.  I?ve had it before?likely due to my TMJ but this is pretty annoying.  It?s been nonstop for about 7 hours.  Could be a coincidence but thought I should report.

When I came out he looked at me with his lazy eye and sweat. He did not say anything then his eyes rolled back then fainted. He did not remember the event . I pat him on his shoulder and he was awake right a way. I called 911 but he felt better before the emergency people arrived and they checked him out. He refused to go to the hospital.

I had extreme thirst that could not be quenched and was unable to go back to sleep. The entire day after the vaccination my stomach was slightly upset, but mostly I felt bad the rest of the day due to the lack of sleep. After work that day, I came home and went to bed around 6 PM. The symptoms went away after getting some sleep and were overall minor, but the extreme thirst was something I had never experienced before.

He was given a bottle of water. The patient then purchased Benadryl and took 50mg. He continued to sit in the pharmacy and his symptoms were monitored. The patient stated that his symptoms were not worsening, but they were not residing either. The patient remained in the pharmacy for approximately 1 hour with no worsening of symptoms. He was advised not to drive after taking the Benadryl. He contacted a friend to meet him at the pharmacy. He then stated he was going to go home and continue to monitor his symptoms. He stated he will seek medical attention if his symptoms worsened. He was advised to contact his physician and inform him of the incident. The patient was advised not to get the second unless his doctor still recommended it, and if so, to receive the dose in a facility. The patient listed no allergies. The patient was asked if he had ever had a severe allergic reaction to anything in the past, and the patient responded he had not.

Second migraine was approximately 2 weeks later and had visual disturbances.  Third migraine was the day after the second shot.  Fourth migraine (worst of all of them) occurred approximately two weeks after the second shot and had significant visual disturbances that occurred while driving.

                                                The night  I got the vaccine, I had severe heart palpitations that continued for a couple of weeks but very severe the first night. Since the second night I have had severe insomnia. Tried trazodone, ambien then clonazepam in that order. Clonazepam helped but I weaned myself off after 3 weeks, did not want to get addicted to them and I also started having tinnitus in right year. Not sure if it is from vaccine, lack of sleep or clonazpeam. 9 weeks out since 1st dose and I continue to suffer from severe insomnia. Only get about 4-5 hours of sleep that is fractured. Takes hours to fall asleep. Skipped 2nd dose due to side effect after 1st dose. Never had sleep issues ever.

                                                I am a pharmacist with 17 years of clinical experience and so medically literate. The night of the vaccine I had severe heart palpitations that woke me every 2 hours, but I managed to get some sleep. The 2nd night I could not fall asleep at all. I stayed up all night. 2nd night tried melatonin and benadryl, and only manged to sleep 2 hours very late in the night. This went on for a week. I saw a doctor and was given trazodone. It helped fall asleep but kept waking up every hour or 2 and then trouble falling asleep afterwards. So only managed 3-4 hours of sleep each night. I had side effects from Trazodone with mood changes so had to stop taking it. I saw another doctor based on a friend&#39;s recommendation who was going through the same issue. I was prescribed clonazepam 1mg. I was finally able to sleep a full night. I took it for 7-10 days and tried to taper back since I did not want to be dependent on it and wanted to go back to sleeping without  any sleeping aids. Klonopin 0.5mg seemed to be helping so on a follow-up appointment, I was given a months supply of clonazepam 0.5mg. I took that for a week and tried to taper that further and that did not help with sleep.  Amidst of this I started having tinnitus in the right ear and I never had tinnitus before. I don&#39; t know if it was triggered by sleep deprivation, the vaccine or the clonazepam.  But I stopped taking clonazepam altogether after 3 weeks.  9 weeks out since the 1st dose and I can sleep a little on alternate nights only. And that sleep is fractured. So one night of almost no sleep and one night of 3-4 of hours of sleep if lucky. I tried benadryl and it helps a little but the trouble falling asleep is just as severe and continue to wake up every 2-3 hours. 8 hours in bed and only manage 3-4 hours of sleep. I skipped the 2nd dose due to continued issues with sleep. Looking for answers and guidance on how best to treat this and if/when this will be over for me.

He went stiff and started tipping over. I ran in and tried to keep him from falling. I guided him to the wall and down to the floor. His friend who also received the shot, came in to assist me since pt. is pretty big and was dead weight. His friend said this happens several times a day. We sat him up and waited. He then started having a seizure that lasted 3-5 seconds. Then he stated he was seeing black spots and felt weird. I called EMS and the police and EMT&#39;s took him out on a stretcher.

Since taking the vaccine, I have near constant tinnitus. It is very severe and often does not go away for several days. When it does seem to go away, it will typically return in about 24 hours. Rarely has a full day passed since it started where it was not present. I went to see a doctor. I told him I had never had tinnitus before taking the vaccine and he said there was absolutely no possibility of it being the cause. I told him I did not believe that and was certain it was an adverse reaction from the Covid vaccine. Since then, I have been researching and it appears I&#39;m not the only person to have the adverse reaction. I have recently called his office and told them that I wanted it reported as an adverse reaction on my behalf. All they said was he made a note in my file about it but acted like it wouldn&#39;t be reported.

                                                Started with loud ringing in my left ear at 2pm, followed 2 hours later with complete hearing loss in left ear and then woke up the next morning  at 6:30am with severe vertigo (nausea and inability to walk).  Vertigo got better after lights turned on to the point that I had no nausea anymore, but needed to hold onto things while walking.  Ringing  Went to urgent care at 10am to get assessed and after speaking with an ENT they prescribed Prednisone and Meclizine.  Meclizine didn&#39;t help so only took for 2 days, was on Prednisone for 3 weeks .

Every night since last Tuesday January 27th I have woken up drenched in sweat multiple times a night.  Assuming this is a fever breaking.  I reported this to my doctor today and he advised me to go to this site.  If it continues I will see him next week. I have also had chills and eyes burning during the day ever since the 2nd shot.  The day after the 2nd shot my fever went to 101.5.  But I did not think that irregular since I heard that was a possibility.  The days after though I dont think are a regular vaccine event.

                                                Within 48 hours of receiving the COVID vaccine, I began having extreme pressure and discomfort in my right ear.  Symptoms included dizziness, fullness in the ear and hearing loss.  This persisted for several days.  As a first course of action, I took Tylenol and antihistamines.   I saw my PCP a few days later and he misdiagnosed my condition and suggested that I continue with antihistamines and Flonase.  Two weeks later my condition had improved only slightly and I became more concerned.  I asked my PCP whether a short course of steroids was warranted (at the suggestion of my mom and wife, who are both health care professionals).  He prescribed a &#34;dose pack,&#34; which I started on or about Monday, Feb. 22.  Later that week, I connected with an ENT  who is a friend of a friend .  When I told him my story and symptoms he was extremely concerned and got me an immediate appointment on Friday, Feb. 26.  At that visit I was diagnosed with acute and severe Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that had resulted in 92% hearing loss in my right ear.   Additional symptoms continue to include fullness, tinnitus and other discomfort.  None of these issues existed prior to my COVID vaccine shot.  I am currently undergoing a treatment of high dose prednisone and steroid injections in my ear.   I am scheduled for another visit with doctor on Friday, March 12.

                                                After 24 hours, I started having body aches, that night couldn&#39;t sleep I took Ibuprofen it helped, over the weekend I kept taking Ibuprofen. Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                30 minutes after the shot I started to feel numbnes and hot on left of my face and ear.  It didn&#39;t really worried me at that time because I thought it is normal and it will go away. It didn&#39;t go away and I felt hotness around my face ear, and my hearing in my right ear was slighly worse, including some pain in the ear. First time I contacted my family doctor 4 days later when the symptoms got worse. My dr told me to use Ibuprofen 600 3 times a day for 3 days. After I didn&#39;t see any improvement I scheduled the appointment and saw my doctor 8 days after the vaccination. My doctor said my ear is clear and there was no infection and she gave me different antinflamatory medicine to take it for a week tis time. She didn&#39;t think that was from  the vaccine though. After a week It seems that I felt better but still not completely recovered. I stopped taking this medication after a week as descibed. the sympthomcame back and now I&#39;m 16 days after the shot and 6 day before the second dose and I&#39;m scared what to do.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

I had stopped moving to rearrange some items. While stopped, I started to feel lightheaded, develop tunnel vision, and feel faint, almost to the point of blacking out. I put my head down and legs up and felt somewhat better. I then attempted to return to my car. I could go 100-200 yards at a stretch, before having to purposefully fall down and elevate my legs. I traveled the mile back to my car like this (slowly). I could not check my pulse because my hands were too cold; my respiration rate was elevated. At the car, I drank fluids and warmed up and began to recover enough to get home.

The symptoms lasted for about 1 week.   I saw my physician about day 3.  He recommended not getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  He recommended either the Claritin (that I ended up taking) or prednisone.

Patient was given liquid diphenhydramine and water and stated the difficulty swallowing improved but his mouth still had the tingling sensation.  Patient never reported facial swelling or difficulty breathing and declined an EpiPen.  After 30 minutes or so patient reported improvement and left our facility.  We reached out to the patient later that day and they had continual improvement, but felt they had experienced a possible allergic reaction.

                                                Recurrence of tinnitus after 8 years of not experiencing with loud noises or just around me. Subjectively, background tinnitus is about 2X what it was before and tinnitus with loud noises is 10X-20X more intense to the point of making me try to avoid the noise triggering it.

No issues with breathing (even while wearing a mask).  Reaction started with blurred vision while reading (during the waiting period at the vaccination clinic). Started within 10 minutes of receiving vaccine.  Then the throat heaviness started, nose became numb, and lips were somewhat numb.  It occurred in waves, with a few minutes of symptoms, then a mild relief of symptoms (but not total relief), then symptoms returned. This continued for 30-45 minutes.   Received water and 2 Benadryl at the vaccination clinic from RN. Benadryl didn&#39;t seem to have any impact on symptoms.

I was out for a minute or two and when I was conscious again my vision was blurry and I felt very drunk for the next 45mins - hour. I also felt like I could taste the chemicals from the vaccine when I became conscious again.  The drunk/vertigo feeling subsided slowly over time but I was given a Benadryl from the pharmacist so I?m not sure when the dizziness stopped but I definitely could not drive home. My fainting was not due to any anxiety due to having a shot or anything, I was perfectly fine for approx 10-15 mins after the vaccine then I felt a cold feeling coming on from my right shoulder then up my neck then I got foggy and dizzy and passed out

Now been 15 days since shot and still have steady ringing.  Went to emt last week, my hearing is ok but they can&#39;t do anything directly about my ear ringing.   Head has mostly cleared at this point but ear still ringing.  Can&#39;t sleep at night.

                                                1 or 2 minutes after shot started feeling dizzy.  Heart rate felt like it dropped and blood pressure felt very low.  Vision was dark and I spent most of the time concentrating on breathing.  I did not lose consciousness or pass out at any time.   I was with my wife and children so they were able to give me the timeline.  My wife noted I started sweating after about 5 minutes.  The symptoms peaked at about 10 minutes and faded slowly after that.  Because I felt like the worst of the event had passed we did not report the event at the time.  When we got home I laid down for about an hour.  My shoulder started hurting about this time as well.  I feel I was recovered from the initial symptoms within 2 days.  My shoulder was in pain for about 3 days, with the first two days being much worse than the third.

                                                Initially, the patient had dizziness, lightheadedness and a syncopal episode within 5 minutes of the vaccine. He returned to normal fairly quickly and went home by report. He presented to the ER shortly after with palpitations and shortness of breath and required a dose of IM epinephrine. Patient since had intermittent fatigue, dizziness, blurred and vision changes as well as tinnitus. On May 31, 2021, patient presented to the ER with headache, lethargy, weakness, diaphoresis and dizziness. Additionally, noted to have slurred speech by his wife. MRI of the brain done at 4 am on 5/31/21 showed  the following  &#34;1. Acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts are seen with a right posterior 4.3  mm focus a left middle cerebellar peduncle 3.2 mm focus and a left superior cerebellar 7.9 mm linear focus. 2. Occlusion of the left vertebral artery extending into the basilar artery with reconstitution of the basilar artery via bilateral posterior communicating arteries. Findings are concerning for acute dissection occlusion. Consider further evaluation with MRA head and neck. 3. Question subtle area of restricted diffusion seen within the left dorsal medulla better appreciated on the maps measuring approximately 4.9 mm. Left lateral pontine 7.3 mm focus of restricted diffusion versus  artifact. These infarcts are not definite and could be artifactual asymmetry.&#39;. He required admission, heparin drip and neurology consult at that time, as well as permissive hypertension. shortly after 1 pm on May 31, he developed chest pain with ischemic changes on EKG requiring cardiology consult with possible intervention, though this was being coordinated with interventional neurology, as he also required basilar angiogram for his MRI findings. as cardiology and interventional neurology were coordinating taking patient for intervention, he became further unresponsive, though maintained his pulse, and required intubation and transfer to ICU, as well as repeat CT of the head to evaluate for continued thrombosis of his basilar system. Work up is still on going

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history was reported.    On 25-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 25-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 30-Mar-2021, the patient experienced TINNITUS (ringing in left ear), EAR CONGESTION (congestion in left ear) and EAR PAIN (on and off pain in left ear). On an unknown date, the patient experienced DEAFNESS (high-frequency hearing loss) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was treated with VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID] ongoing since an unknown date at an unspecified dose and frequency; CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC [CURCUMA LONGA]) ongoing since an unknown date at an unspecified dose and frequency; ALPHA LIPOIC ACID ongoing since an unknown date at an unspecified dose and frequency; PREDNISONE at an unspecified dose and frequency; AZELASTINE ongoing since an unknown date at an unspecified dose and frequency; FLUTICASONE ongoing since an unknown date at an unspecified dose and frequency and LORATADINE (CLARITINE) at an unspecified dose and frequency. On 04-May-2021, EAR CONGESTION (congestion in left ear) had resolved. At the time of the report, DEAFNESS (high-frequency hearing loss) and TINNITUS (ringing in left ear) had not resolved and EAR PAIN (on and off pain in left ear) outcome was unknown.            The patient was taking no concomitant medications. Treatment included a two week trial for hearing aid that provided notch therapy for tinnitus but patient had not noticed any improvement in hearing or ringing. Completed the course of prednisone and antibiotic with no improvement.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

After the patient finished his lunch in his room he was wheeled out to the nursing station for observation.  at 1:30pm the nurse wheeled patient into our working/set up area and stated that patient is having a vaccine reaction.  I observed that his lips were noticeably swollen.  I asked patient to stick out his tongue, it also was noticeably swollen.  Only the tip of his tongue extended about 1/2 inch past his lips.  I administered 0.3mg of Epinephrine via and epi-pen into his right thigh and instructed the nursing staff to call 911.  Patient improved markedly over the next 10 minutes when Fire Department EMT&#39;s arrived.  Nursing staff monitored his  blood pressure, heart rate and pulse  and oxygen sat.  heart rate was elevated somewhat likely due to epi , BP was 121/73, pulse steady and ox sat good.  Fire Department transported patient to a nearby ER for further evaluation and treatment if necessary.

Mild pain at injection site within a few hours.  3am (9 hours after injection) I went to the bathroom, and while standing got dizzy and lightheaded tried to sit down.  Collapsed while trying to sit down and hit head on bathroom floor.  Cut right eyebrow on floor.  Tried to get back to bed and was in and out of consciousness for 30-60 seconds per spouse.  Vasovagal response symptoms.  Cold sweats.  I was very thirsty and drank a tall glass of water.  5 minutes later I stood up and went back to bed feeling fine.  I slept the rest of the night and felt fine the next day, and for the rest of the weekend with no other symptoms.

Symptoms persist, and seem to be worse at night, while at home and not at work.  PCP has me taking Lipo-Flavonoid Plus, to help with the symptoms, which help eliminate some of the loud buzzing, but not all of it.

                                                After first vaccine on March 15, I only had arm pain at injection site, but I started having pretty regular ringing in my ears, mainly in my left ear and for a very shorty duration each time it occurred. After second injection, I had pain at injection site shortly after injection that became much more intense and moved to my bicep the next morning. On the first day, I also felt tired and unable to concentrate, which became more severe on the second day before subsiding on the third. On the morning of the second day, I began having random, brief pinching pains in different parts of my body. These have occurred randomly since that day, at most 10 times a day or so, primarily in neck, arms and legs. I had a fever of 100.2 on the evening of the second day. The ringing in my ears is now very quiet and high pitched, but more or less constant and in both ears. Whenever it is quiet, I hear it or if I pay attention when it is not quiet, it is still there. I noticed the constant ringing yesterday morning (April 17) and it has persisted.

He presented to clinic about 1 week later for evaluation. There were no obvious signs of trauma or infection at the time. He followed up with this Dentist and it was suggested he likely had a chemical burn secondary to citrus foods. He followed up with another provider and was treated with a 3 day course of an antiviral medication for herpes without any change in symptoms. He hasn&#39;t had oral herpes before, but has had shingles.  He received his second Moderna vaccine on 3/25/2021 and 3 days later developed significant throat pain and swelling in his neck glands that was visible to him. His symptoms improved slightly, but have never completely resolved. He has had what feels like a dry sore throat for 7-8 weeks and intermittent white patches in the back of his mouth. He has no history of or active allergy symptoms. Was treated for oral candidiasis on 4/19/2021, but it&#39;s unclear if his vaccine triggered these symptoms.

Pt showed photos of lip swelling, and he reported it to his health care provider.  His health care provider sent an email that recommended not receiving the second dose of Moderna. However,  pt was automatically scheduled from his first visit to get second dose, and pt showed up to site to discuss it and showed this vaccinator the email and photos and described this course. This vaccinator did not administer second dose of vaccine and recommended discussing alternatives with MD.

                                                I have tinnitus and mild ear pain in my right ear.  My doctor examined my ears and did not see any ear wax or inflammation.  I got very sick in late February 2020 with COVID-like symptoms (severe headache, fever of 104, fatigue, loss of taste, and a dry cough).  Approximately 3 days into being sick I developed a significant pain in my right ear.  It took me approximately 6 to 7 days to recover and the ear pain subsided.  The dry cough lasted another two weeks or so.  I went to the ER because my headache was so intense and my fever was so high.  They gave me a flu test but that came back negative.  They were not able to diagnose what I had.  The tinnitus  and ear pain started approximately 1 week after my first Moderna dose and has lasted now for about 6 weeks.  My doctor prescribed prednisone but that is not working.

                                                Loss of vision; Possible lowgrade central retinal occlusion; retinal venous dilation; Decreased vision; Unexplained Retinal Hemorrhages; A spontaneous report was received from an ophthalmologist retinal specialist concerning a 46-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and developed loss of vision, decreased vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion.     The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 23 Dec 2020, approximately four days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20-2A) intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 27 Dec 2020, the patient experienced decreased vision.  On 29 Dec 2020, the physician examined the patient. There was some retinal hemorrhage, venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion. Lab work was requested by the physician and results were pending. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events, loss of vision, decreased vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a  46 year old male patient. The patient&#39;s medical history is not provided. The patient experienced a serious, unexpected event of loss of vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade  central retinal occlusion. The event occurred 4 days after first dose of the mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information are required for further assessment.

                                                I developed tinnitus in my ears about 3 to 4 hours after vaccine. I normally don&#39;t get this. Rarely after a concert or game but short lived. This has stuck around and I kept waiting for it to disappear. Unfortunately it has not. My right ear is worse than my left but the tinnitus remains so I thought I should report it. I have been looking on-line for any other reports and see none. This may be coincidence but due to lack of resolution of tinnitus, I thought I should report it. My flu-like symptoms (headache, shaking chills, sore arm) disappeared within 36 hours.

These symptoms began to resolve 24 hours after they started. These were the exact same symptoms that I experienced when I had Covid-19.

Thinking it might be a Conjunctivitis, assuming it was a windy week in my area, I did do some yard work. That night it started to build pressure, pain and headache.  I asked my spouse to buy me eyedrops., did used with no relief. I&#39;ve putting cold packs at the beginning, but it gives me more headache, I changed to warm compress, and had some relief.  For 4 days I suffered the same symptoms and discomfort, not until the 4th day (Friday) I can&#39;t take it anymore, I went to an urgent care, they check my V/S, BP is elevated, ranging from 140&#39;s/92&#39;s. They check my eye pressure, it was elevated.  The PA prescribed Tobramycin eyedrop(Tobrex) and recommend me to see an Ophthalmologist to do further evaluation.  The next day 5th day (Saturday) went to Dr., get evaluated both of my eyes had high pressure,

I started to get dizzy and was sweating.  Called over the Fire Dept personnel who were administering the injections and they helped me (fluids, ECG, etc.).  During this time they stated that my blood pressure dropped to the low 40&#39;s (not sure the exact number) and my heart rate as well.  My complexion was pale to them and sweating a lot.  After administering IV fluids a few minutes later my BP and HR started to rise.  My SpO2 was good.  Transported to ER for evaluation and labwork.

I also had a metallic taste.   3.  Fortunately, the chills, body aches, and fatigue went away the second day.  However, I continued to have the metallic taste for days. 4.  Also, starting the third day and I still have a cough and tightness in my lungs.  I went into a doctor at urgent care four days after the second dose (due to a concern about the cough and tightness in my lungs).  All of my vitals were normal and they attributed to side effects from the vaccine.  Also, they gave me an inhaler. 5.  The inhaler has been somewhat helpful, but I had a consistent cough as well as  some tightness in my lungs for two weeks after the second dose.  On unusually stressful days, it was even worse. 6.   The cough has improved, but I still have it occasionally throughout the day as well as the tightness in my lungs.   7.  Finally, I continue to have the metallic taste.

                                                Two or three days after receiving my first shot of the Moderna vaccine, I began having severe tinnitus (ringing in ears). I have had minor tinnitus for the past five years as a result of attending a very loud concert, however, that normally didn&#39;t disrupt me. The tinnitus since my vaccine has been so severe that it sometimes keeps me from falling  asleep or wakens me. After a few weeks, the tinnitus was less severe, but it has not returned to its normal levels. I&#39;ve read of many other people who have the same symptom, so I&#39;m hesitant about getting another vaccine dose. I&#39;ll get guidance from my ENT.

                                                Pt reports onset on metallic taste in mouth after first vaccination, pt also reports urine and stool both have stool. Pt reports smell is most noticeable after eating any protein (eggs, meat, fish). Pt described immediately after first vaccine was strong enough to make him avoid eating; pt reported to primary care provider 5 wks later reporting symptoms are less severe now.  Pt still notices smell with eating proteins, but now is less noticeable.  Pt received second Moderna vaccine 4/27/21 regardless of smell he has been experiencing since first vaccine dose.

Usually I can notice it if I tried but now could not sleep, can hear it over tv and music. Two weeks later still bad and seems to be increasing.  Also noticed little blood spots showing up on skin on chest, legs, arms. very small, raised, and probably around 20-30 on whole body.

About April 13, 2021, my tinnitus began to significantly increase, especially in my right ear (3/10 left ear, 5/10 right ear). It was annoying, but I was able to sleep. Though I did get a little anxious about whether it was permanent or would get worse.  It peaked on May 1, 2021 (4/10 left ear, 6/10 right ear), and has been slowly getting better since then. I&#39;d now characterize the left ear varying between 2-3/10, and right ear varying between 3-4/10.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA:  immediately upon receiving injection, heart began racing, and what had been a relatively quite ringing in my ears for the past year or two, also immediately became 2-3x louder (maybe even more?), where it has remained ever since (nearly 2 months).  The heart rate settled down within a few second, but the ringing persisted, and has continued.  Before the vaccine, the ringing was a very high pitched, constant tone, like the high pitched tone I used to hear on an airplane sometimes, but it was so quiet that I only noticed when I would wake up in the morning or at other random times when everything around me was very quiet.  Since the vaccine, however, it has become loud enough that it&#39;s impossible not to notice it constantly; not so loud that I can&#39;t hear other things around me or people talking, but definitely loud enough that it&#39;s unmistakably there and can at times be a real distraction to focus and even conversation.

                                                Condition aggravated; Palpitations; Tinnitus; This case was received on 01-Jun-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 01-Jun-2021.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Condition aggravated), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations) and TINNITUS (Tinnitus) in a 46-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 039A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure high, Asthma and Allergy NOS. Concomitant products included FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE, SALMETEROL XINAFOATE (ADVAIR) and LOSARTAN for an unknown indication.    On 25-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 25-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Condition aggravated) (seriousness criterion disability), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations) (seriousness criterion disability) and TINNITUS (Tinnitus) (seriousness criterion disability). At the time of the report, CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Condition aggravated), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations) and TINNITUS (Tinnitus) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Immediately upon receiving injection, the patient&#39;s heart began racing, and what had been a relatively quite ringing in his ears for the past year or two, also immediately became 2-3x louder (maybe even more), where it had remained ever since (nearly 2 months). The heart rate settled down within a few second, but the ringing persisted, and continued. Before the vaccine, the ringing was a very high pitched, constant tone, like the high pitched tone he used to hear on an airplane sometimes, but it was so quiet that he only noticed when he would wake up in the morning or at other random times when everything around him was very quiet. Since the vaccine, however, it became loud enough that it was impossible not to notice it constantly; not so loud that he could not hear other things around him or people talking, but definitely loud enough that it was unmistakably there and could at times be a real distraction to focus and even conversation.  Treatment medications were not reported.

                                                About two weeks after getting my first shot, besides the typical pain at the injection site ( felt like a decent punch to the arm for about 1 week), I had the sensation of having an abscessed tooth. I?ve had an abscessed tooth before and the sensation was the same. Both sides of my jaw were very sore, hard to open my mouth,  pain radiating up my jaw and into my ears on both sides of my face. The next day my face muscles ?dropped? like they became too relaxed and it seemed to me exactly like my abscessed tooth from the past. I had started to take some antibiotics that I have on hand in preparation for a visit to the oral surgeon. Three days of this and the pain and my muscle issue disappeared. I should note that I lost my taste throughout the three days that this happened. Everything is normal since, just wanted to bring this up and report this strange reaction.

I had him lay down with feet up bp 89/41/54 at 1:25pm , a few minutes later he said his visiion had improved and took some water. at 1:30 bp was 97/61 60  some improvement but felt worse a few min later 1:34 bp 94/59 60 and at 1:44 bp 97/69 57 he felt well enough to stand, walk around  at 1:49 he left with his freinds but confided to the translater that he was still nausated. (he had not eaten lunch yet) I avdvised that if he still felt bad that he should consider seeing a doctor. He and his friends then purchased some crackers and tylenol before leaving  the store.

                                                Just over 24 hours after receiving shot, I had a pressure located at the top of my right eye. Not the lid, not the sinus area above, the actual eyeball. I&#39;m an optometrist, so the following day, one of my partners examined me and found no cause. It was uncomfortable for the remainder of the day as well as the next. Saturday, 3 days after getting shot, I felt extreme pressure within the right eye. No vision problems, no pain with eye movements, no peripheral vision loss; just a lot of pressure/soreness. I spoke with a colleague in a specialty eye care practice. Since symptoms continued, though milder the following day, he ordered a CT scan. I had the scan Jan 21 (8 days after receiving first vaccine dose). I took Aleve and a sinus decongestant (though pain did not feel like sinus pain and was not located within sinus area)  No other symptoms occurred and it reduced in severity and now asymptomatic since Jan 24.

                                                Since receiving Moderna shot #1 vaccine I have experienced three gout attacks. It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

I did not have any itchiness, pain, or teary eye.  On 2/14/21 the blood now was in 75%  of my right eye.  Today on 2/15/21 I went to urgent care to have it checked out and they told me I had a ruptured blood vessel.  My entire eye  is now covered in blood.  I had not experienced any vomiting or had any cough of any type, or hit my eye anywhere for this to happen.

Got epi 0.3 mg IM, Decadron 10 mg IV, Zyrtec 10 mg, Pepcid 40 mg po, Benadryl 25 mg po, with improvement.  Allergy consulted, felt this was likely delayed hypersensitivity reaction to Moderna, but couldn&#39;t exclude lisinopril side effect.  They recommended Zyrtec 10 mg bid for 1 wk, and stay off lisinopril.  Will follow up in Clinic to determine how to approach 2nd shot.

                                                Three days after receiving my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine, I had a sudden onset of tinnitus. I&#39;ve never had tinnitus symptoms before with any other vaccine or in general (aside from acute tinnitus after rock concerts), much less sudden onset tinnitus. Once the normal, published side effects (aching, sore arm, fatigue) subsided, I immediately began noticing a constant ringing/buzzing in my ears. The left ear is more prominent, but I have it in both ears. I also experience a higher sensitivity to loud sounds. As of 4/2/2021, I still have mild-moderate ringing in my ears, especially in quiet situations.

His vitals were stable at BP 133/95, HR 90, Pulse ox 97% on room air. His symptoms persisted so 911 was promptly called. Dr. came and assessed patient and he was found to have clear lungs with no abnormal heart sounds. When EMS arrived, his vitals were very similar and still stable. Patient was taken to Hospital. I spoke with him the following day, 4/7/21, and he reported that his labs were all unremarkable and they treated him for a panic attack and he was feeling well by the time he got home.

                                                About 30 min after leaving the vaccination site I was driving home and felt face getting flush and tingly, on one side of my face. Felt slight swelling of my mouth and tongue. Those lasted about 45 min to an hour and they dissipated and then about a week later I started having a full body sensation, I started feeling like a burning sensation all through my body, like an internal sunburn all through my body and I have been feeling like that ever since. It also started oscillating between the burning sensation and a cold sensation. I also feel like pins and needles and most recently numbing of my hands and arms. It has been chronic since then. My PCP told me to take Zyrtec 30mg a day OTC and it did not help. I then met with a neurologist and allergist. Allergist did not believe it was an allergic reaction. The neurologist prescribed prednisone and it did not help. She also prescribed B12 (I have a history of B12 deficiency) and  she initially diagnosed me with sensory malfiber polyneuropathy. She has been running some auto immune tests and some have come back normal and she is trying to figure it out the next plan of care. It is not just a sensation, part of it is physiological because my ears for example sometimes get very red and hot to the touch and my hands get very cold.

More significantly, on Saturday April 17th I began to experience &#34;popping&#34; sounds in my right ear. Overnight my ear began to ache a fair amount. It has subsided some since. This is my first ear ache since I was in elementary school in the 1980s and is not common to allergies. It seems clearly related to the vaccine,  This was my first shot with Moderna.

                                                First injection, no issues.  Second injection led to blood glucose of 368 about an hour post injection.   Beginning the morning of Sunday, 04/18/21, I had a low blood glucose episode early in the morning (meaning blood glucose 30 mg/dL or below). Typical to these I react by sweating profusely, trembling, visual anomalies, anxiety.   Never in my life have I experienced what I did on 04/18/21 concurrent with low blood glucose out of dozens and dozens of such episodes in my lifetime since being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 3. I suffered right side weakness (hand, arm, leg, trouble focusing right eye). My blood glucose at that time was low and I immediately drank some juice and ate something, but even an hour into the episode I was experiencing right side weakness and difficulty keeping my footing and hand action.

This was a constant sound in both ears that was present at all times.  Over the next 3 weeks the noise level of the ringing fluctuated while moving downward in noise level.  By 3 weeks after the first dose the ringing was almost gone.  I received the second dose 4/17/21 and later in the day the noise level was higher than it ever was after the first dose.  As I type this 3&#43; weeks later the noise level has not gone down at all.  It is with me at all times.  It makes it hard to fall asleep at times and is there the instant I wake.  In the last 1&#43; week I have noticed a pressure in my ears.

I sat down to wait for my 15 minutes to be up as requested by the pharmacist. Within a minute of waiting my tongue started feeling numb on my left side and the left side of my face started tingling (cheek and region just below my eye). I also felt like my throat was tight and felt like I needed to clear my throat. I started researching &#34;face tingling moderna&#34; as I was getting concerned. I waited in the chairs for 20 minutes or so and no one came out of the pharmacy. My symptoms had not worsened but were not all the way gone with the face tingling remaining the longest. I decided to do some shopping as planned and would report my symptoms to the pharmacy if they didn&#39;t go away. All in all my symptoms lasted 25-30 minutes with the most intensity in the first 15 minutes.&#34;

                                                I received my second dose last month. I didn?t notice this symptom until maybe a week or two ago. But it seem to be more constant and it?s gotten to the point that for the last few days I am walking around thinking a tv, or light or fan or something electrical is on.   The reason being, I?m getting a constant high pitched tone in my right ear. It sounds almost like a high pitched dog whistle. If Will it ever go away.   Thanks in advance.

                                                Pt began to get tunnel vision, dizziness, migraine, upper back pain, and extreme fatigue approximately 6 hours after the dose was injected. He denied treatment and decided to rest instead - which helped. He drank about 5 bottles of water, but his urine remained dark. The tunnel vision lasted for about an half-hour. The rest of the symptoms remain, and he now has a fever as well.

                                                I received my first Moderna shot on March 22 and my second on April 19. I had very bad side effects both times, though the second was worse with chills, dizziness, some light fever, body aches, sweating. This lasted up to two weeks after my second dose. I hardly ever take sick time off, but I had to leave work several times due to vaccine symptoms showing up.  A month later, around May 15th, I started to feel a waxy feeling on the roof of my mouth and I had noticed even before this that I couldn&#39;t whistle like I normally can. By May 23, I went to the ER for facial paralysis on my right side. I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. At this moment it&#39;s just my face, no other body parts.

Three days after the shot, I noticed slight lymph node shooting pain on my right jaw, under ear.   I?ll be getting the second shot...it beats COVID-19 by at least a mile!

From the evening it began to spread to the chest and legs. Saturday got worse, so itching in my neck and chest. The eyes were swollen and the double eyelid disappeared. On Sunday, my eyes were swollen and pus started to form from the red spots. On Monday, I couldn&#39;t go to work because my eyes were so swollen, and my skin became dry and itchy.

                                                Both eyes very swollen, watery and itching on evening of 3/16. Appeared pretty quickly. Could be &#39;normal&#39; allergies, but was quite a bit more of a reaction than I would normally get. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve had my eyes swell this much before that I can remember. During day of 3/16 did not do anything outside in or around normal triggers when doing something like yard work. Took Kroger brand max strength sinus relief pills and went to bed. Morning of 3/17 eyes still swollen but not as much...much less watering and itching. Still swollen some at the time of this submission.

                                                Once, for a short time while performing a mild workout in the gym, and again a couple hours later, and for an extended duration (approximately 40 minutes),  while checking out at Costco I experienced what I believe to have been aura migraines without headache (or ocular migraines) in my right eye. What initially appeared to be a slight glare, I later determined was an obscuration of the lower half of my vision in that eye which could be described as a clouding effect.  While disorienting and concerning, with closing/covering that eye, the problem slowly resolved itself. Within about 20 minutes, I had enough vision to comfortably and safely drive home. Another 20 minutes after that and the event had ended as far as I could tell.  I have never experienced anything like this in the past. Doing some (dangerous, I know) searching online, I discovered what it might be called and learned that there were some reports of similar events occurring with other vaccine recipients. Since I don&#39;t have a primary care physician, I&#39;m hoping it is directly related to the vaccine and I hope it doesn&#39;t happen again with the second dose since my eyes are a critical part of my job.

About 9:45 am driving, I noticed my face starting to numb on my right hand side beginning with my upper lip, around my nostril, cheek and jaw line. After an hour of numbness, I called my doctors office and spoke with a nurse. The nurse had not heard of these symptoms before and sent me to the local ER at the hospital. As we drove to the ER, I noticed my jaw muscles getting tighter, but not so over powering that it felt like it would lock up. While under observation for an an hour or so, a Physician?s Assistant did neurological exams as my symptoms looked like a potential mild stroke. I passed the exams and sent home to observe any changes. The morning of day two (today), I have strong flu like symptoms with chills, shivering, aching muscles and the skin on my back and neck have a pins and needles feeling. What?s more, I have a present ringing in my ears today.

His head rolled back and his eyes started to rolled back. His wife was next to him and held his neck. the pharmacist administered an Epi-pen into his left thigh and 911 was called. He became conscious within seconds of receiving the Epi-pen. He was able to verbally communicate and was able to tell us his age. He was very thirsty &amp; became very sweaty in the minutes after he came to. He said he&#39;s never had a severe reaction after vaccines, never gets the flu shot and doesn&#39;t have history of seizures. Paramedics came immediately and took him to the Hospital.

                                                patient self reported tetracycline allergy that resulted in difficulty breathing and hives.  Reaction happened many years ago. I asked patient to wait an additional 10 minutes for a total of 25 minutes so we could keep him under observation.  After his 25 minutes patient reported that his fingers felt swollen and he had taken his wedding ring off to show me.  Patient also reported that his lips felt &#34;tingly&#34;.  I observed the patient and noted no flushing, no sweating, no rapid pulse.  I took the patients blood pressure and it was 121/80.  I gave the patient Benadryl  and asked him to wait for another 15 minutes so I could observe him.  After the 15 minutes I observed the patient again and he still had no flushing or swelling and he reported that he no longer felt &#34;tingly&#34; and felt fine.

                                                After two days I experienced a loud ringing noise in both of my ears.    It&#39;s been over two weeks and the noise has not subsided.      I have a Son that suffers from tinnitus - I would compare the symptoms to those of my son&#39;s tinnitus.  I have had to purchase a white noise machine to assist with sleeping.     This is very alarming - had I known of the outcome I would not have taken the vaccine.  I hope this noise reduces over time.    I would be happy to discuss more if requested.

Never had that like this before so loud and pulsing, Checked online and a lot of people are reporting that as a side effect.  it only started an hour ago  so nothing else to report yet, i&#39;m assuming it&#39;s temporary.

                                                Patient waited the required 15 minutes after I administered his second dose of the Moderna vaccine. When he handed the timer back to me, he said he was starting to feel a strange pain on the right side his jaw, ear and throat suddenly. I told him to have a seat so that I can monitor him further. A few minutes later he said his vision started to become blurry and his mouth became very dry. We brought him a bottle of water. He said he didn&#39;t feel any better and was feeling worse. I suggested to the caregiver that was with him to take him to the emergency room since he was able to talk, walk and breath on his own still. I told his caregiver to call me back at the pharmacy to update me on his status. The caregiver did call me back and it was confirmed that he was having an allergic reaction and he had to be given high dose Benadryl.

                                                Fever and chills with sensation of skin being hot began 15 hours post injection. Took 400mg ibuprofen every 4-6 hours. Exceeded six hours without ibuprofen and fever returned 27 hours post injection. Took 400 mg ibuprofen and immediately became nauseous. Began walking up stairs and lost consciousness and seized/convulsed briefly (witnessed by my wife). Upon regaining consciousness, I was immediately aware of what happened, date, time, etc., so we did not seek medical attention. Continued ibuprofen every 4-6 hours. On two occasions post loss of consciousness, the first within an hour and the second four hours later, I felt tingly and smelled a strong scent of acetone or ammonia. Both passed quickly. Fever broke soon after second incidence. All symptoms were gone within 48 hours of injection.

                                                PATIENT WAS NOT NERVOUS ABOUT RECEIVING HIS FIRST DOSE. OUR IMMUNIZATION CERTIFIED PHARMACY TECH ADMINISTERED THE DOSE. ABOUT 2 MINUTES LATER HE STATED HE WAS FEELING TINGLY AND HIS EAR TURNED A WHITE COLOR. THE TECHNICIAN CALLED ME INTO THE ROOM WHERE I EXAMINED THE PATIENT. HE WAS NOT RESPONDING AND HIS EYES WERE DILATED. HE WAS TRYING TO BREATH BUT HE WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY. WE MOVED HIM TO THE GROUND AND PLACED HIM ON HIS SIDE TO MAKE SURE HE DID NOT ASPERATE. AFTER ABOUT 20 SECONDS OF BEING ON THE GROUD HE STARTED BREATHING NORMALLY AND WAS CONSCIOUS. THE ENTIRE EPISODE LASTED ABOUT 1 MINUTE (MAYBE SLIGHLY LONGER). EMS ARRIVED A FEW MINUTES LATER. HIS PULSE WAS LOW (ABOUT 50 BPM PER EMS) BUT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WAS NORMAL (UNSURE OF THE VALUE). HE SAID HE REMEMBERED TALKING TO US AND THE NEXT THING HE KNEW HE WAS LAYING ON THE GROUND. HE WAS VERY NAUSEOUS AFTERWARDS FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES (HE THREW UP TWICE). WE CONTACTED THE PATIENT THE DAY AFTER AND HE SAID HE WAS FINE AND THAT HE ONLY HAD A SORE ARM. WE BELIEVE THAT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED TOO LOW AND CAUSED A VASOVAGAL TYPE RESPONSE.

When I walked back into the room he was pale and sweating, but responding to questions from the person he arrived with. His arm twitched a few times and his head rolled to the side for a few seconds. Then he regained consciousness, but momentarily looked confused. The patient has a history of seizures, but has not suffered from one in 10 years. After that, the patient remained alert, but continued to sweat and felt light headed for most of standard wait time post vaccination. After the 15 minute wait period the patient felt more normal and left.

The patient developed headache, lack of taste, fatigue as well as the aforementioned rash on 1/14/2021(6 days after receiving first dose of covid vaccine.  A rapid covid test was positive on 1/14/2021 also.  The patient was prescribed claritin, methylprednisolone for the rash after seeing his family physician virtually and the family physician recommended he contact where he was vaccinated to report these symptoms.  I have reached out to the patient for additional information and he has declined, so I do not have any access to details on his positive covid test or records from that virtual encounter.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

                                                Given second shot on Wed 2/24 at 12pm -- Had flu like symptoms for one day.  Woke up on Sat 2/27 with sudden hearing loss in left ear. Hearing loss was accompanied by a loud static sound and pressure. Saw ENT specialist on Tue 3/2 -- no evidence of any wax buildup. She immediately sent me for hearing test; showed 70% loss. Both doctors feel this is a Viral infection and that it may have occurred due to my strong  immune response I had to the COVID vaccine. Was prescribed 60mg of Prednisone for two weeks; am on day 3 as of writing this. Am going to see another specialist tomorrow, 3/5/21. I am a healthy 50yr old male with no previous hearing problems. The only change in my life was getting the vaccine. I think this important to report, although I have yet to find any link between vaccine and SSHL. I have been tested over the last year a few times (mouth swab) and all test were negative. I have not been tested since my hearing loss, though I don&#39;t feel sick at all. I have read that some people who actually had COVID experienced new or increased tinnitus but did not find anyone who had actual hearing loss -- this was just doing some online reading; not actual study reports.

At 5:00 pm, I got out of work, I went straight home because I felt so weak and my eyes got watery (didn&#39;t go to work out afterward) and I got the chills and my bones started to hurt, I went to bed and slept all - my bones were in horrific pain - especially in my back. Saturday morning, I felt the same -I took OTC med for the pain - no fever; body aches, watery eyes and I was very weak. I drank orange juice and I took some Zinc; vitamin C - and I hurt all that day - bones still achy but not quite as much. Sunday morning, I wasn&#39;t normal but better and by Sunday noon I was better; not weak anymore. On a scale from one to 10, I felt like a ten when it was bad. My injection site was sore for a good four days. I took it on a Friday but Tuesday the arm was good to go.

It is not affecting my ability to hear yet, but it is still extremely annoying.  Previous to these vaccines, I did have very mild tinnitus, I would only hear the whine in a very quiet room.  Now I hear it all the time and it does not go away when there are normal sounds in the household or even outside.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.    On 13-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 13-Apr-2021, the patient experienced CONFUSIONAL STATE (confusion/was not coherent) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VISION BLURRED (blurry vision) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VOMITING (vomited) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CARDIAC OUTPUT INCREASED (cardiac outcomes went up, from the lab results they were elevated) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, CONFUSIONAL STATE (confusion/was not coherent), VISION BLURRED (blurry vision), VOMITING (vomited) and CARDIAC OUTPUT INCREASED (cardiac outcomes went up, from the lab results they were elevated) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient had his first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine yesterday and immediately felt the vaccine go to his chest and down to the toes; 30-40 minutes after had confusion, blurry vision; he made it to a hospital in Dallas where he vomited, he could not read at the moment, could not call 911, did not know how to send his location, how to call or text, he was not coherent.

I did not associate it with the vaccine until reading an article about it today, so I just assumed it was the latest surprise from it aging body and didn&#39;t think to much of it. Also it head felt &#34;hazy&#34; at least once, but that has been happening literally my entire life.

It&#39;s a constant, persistent humming like a fan or refrigerator sound. It&#39;s quieter in the morning and gets louder throughout the day. It can make me dizzy and queasy while driving a car. Sometimes this sensation occurs even while walking around my house.

                                                Had 2-3 days of tinnitus in the right ear. The tinnitus presented as a low-pitched hum, that was most prevalent in the morning upon waking. After the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine on May 3rd, 2021, the tinnitus returned within two days. This tinnitus continues to the time of this submission. The symptom presents the same (low hum, right ear), and varies in severity from day to day. It is still most noticeable in the morning, and some days is severe enough to wake me from sleep. I have planned visit to ENT specialist June 1st for this condition.

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine, I woke up and I had flu like symptoms. I had a low grade fever, some nausea, ringing in my ears and fatigue. By bedtime that night, I felt normal except for the tinnitus that stayed. I went to the doctor on 03/26, an audiologist, and she told me that it is tinnitus and she had another patient that got tinnitus after the vaccine also. I am having a lot of trouble hearing now. The doctor told me that the ringing that I hear is a short circuit in my brain. It&#39;s not so much in my ear, but from the processing of the brain. This is a habituation, which means I am listening to sounds through an app or web link to teach my brain how to ignore that sound. There is not any treatment for this condition. I will follow up with the doctor in a year.

                                                For the following month till now my eyes have been very dry and red. Focus changes were dramatically slower than normal up to 30 seconds.  While being treated for a retina issue they noted that my eye pressure was was higher that when it was tested a few months previously with measures of 23 and 25 for the eyes. There was no history of this in previous measures and the previous values were 13 and 15 . On their recommendation I have been using lubricating eye drops several times a day. This has helped but stopping brings the irritation back.  I have lived in the same house, alone, for several years and have not experienced this before. It could be allergies but it seemed worth noting.

Duration approximately 5 minutes then tachycardia and dizziness resolved.  Also had a tremor.  No angioedema, urticaria or other skin/mucosal findings.  Was not anxious.  Arrived home and wife and children told me I looked flushed and noticed my pupils were significantly dilated.  The flushing and dilated pupils resolved over the next hour.  No shortness of breath or hoarse voice of any kind however my mouth felt extremely dry.  I did not do anything for treatment.  Spontaneous resolution.

                                                1.  Woke up the day after receiving the first dose without the ability to taste anything.  I could smell soaps/mint/fragrant lotions etc, if I sniffed it up close, but I could not taste anything. I tested this with several different  types of food.  This lasted until about 12:30 pm that day.  When I ate lunch I could taste my food again.   This was a strange event for me. I have never lost my sense of taste before.  2.  The evening of the third day after receiving the first dose of the moderna COVID-19 vaccine I experienced an approximate 4 inch diameter redness and itching around the injection site on my left shoulder.  There was also an itchy rash that extended across my chest and back to my right shoulder.  I took an antihistamine and went to bed.  When I awoke the next day the rash extending across my chest, back, and right shoulder was gone.  However, my left shoulder still  itched for the rest of that day.  The itchiness was gone when I awoke the next day.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A), intramuscularly in left arm, for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10 Jan 2021, he was sore, felt like had the flu. On 13 Jan 2021, he experienced light sensitivity, and tearing of his right eye. On 19 Jan 2021, he went to the emergency room and found with facial paralysis, droopiness on the right side. He was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy (right eye won&#39;t blink on its own, lip and speech issues).  Treatment included Valtrex.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the event, sore, felt like had the flu was considered resolved on 11 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, Bell&#39;s palsy (right eye won&#39;t blink on its own, lip and speech issues) was not recovered. The outcome of the events, light sensitivity, and tearing of right eye was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 50-year-old male patient. The medical history is not provided. The patient experienced a medically significant and unexpected event of Facial paralysis and unexpected non-serious events of Influenza, Pain, Photophobia and Lacrimation increased. The events of Influenza and Pain occurred approximately one day after receiving their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A). Photophobia and Lacrimation increased occurred approximately four days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A). Event of Facial Paralysis was diagnosed approximately ten days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A). Treatment included Valtrex. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                Started with tightness of chest, (under the lower part of ribcage); sporadic hot flashes and dizziness; pulse going up to 95,( when normal is in the 60&#39;s).  Then sat down an hour later and almost immediately a deep tiredness.  got off work early, went home and had no other problems until I attempted to go to sleep.  Somewhere around nine o&#39;clock, I started getting muscle cramps so I went to the couch.  Shortly after, my right arm, (vaccinated arm) became extremely sore; shortly after, my total body ached; no relief from lying on my left, right, stomach or back; hurt to even sit upright.  Then, I started getting cold chills; which alternated with hot flashes and periods of nausea.  My mouth went extremely dry, so when I struggled to go use the bathroom, I would wobble my way to the kitchen and want to take a big drink of water, attempted to swallow two tylenol, gagged and started throwing up.  Went back to bed and started getting continuous headaches that would move to different places.  This happened the rest of the night and most of Thursday when most of the worst symptoms happened.  Was able to sleep Thursday  night and thought I was feeling better, until I stood up.  Today, I was not able to stand longer than one half an hour at any one point; had to lie down and rest while doing any kind of activity.  I haven&#39;t been able to keep anything down; either vomiting or diarrhea. Have been slowly feeling better with occasional headache.

                                                After I got the shot, on the way home, I started feeling tingling on tongue and lips; had a metallic taste. I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

                                                -Sore arm:  started about 2 hours after injection.  By 18 hours after, it felt like I had a really bad bruise there.  It was throbbing always, more painful to stretch the deltoid where the shot was given, and sharply painful if I used that muscle to lift my arm.  This continued until about 30 hours when it started to reduce in intensity until being gone about 60 hours (2.5 days) after the shot. -General lethargy:  started about 6-7 hours after shot.   Peaked about 24 hours.  Still able to get up and move around but very tired.  Gone at about 43 hour mark. -Body aches:  timeframes the same as lethargy.  Felt at worst like a bad flu. - Headache and lightheadedness:  Started about  2 hours after injection.  Never got really bad, but was fairly consistently there until about 36 hour mark. - Burning eyes: started about 7 hours after shot, was annoying and lasted until about 33 hour mark. - Coughing:  mild but distinct dry cough started about 18 hours after shot and lasted to about 30 hour mark.

Pain would be rated a 9 on a 10 scale.  This was not caused by any impact to my nose.  I was sitting in my chair and watching TV.  This lasted 5 minutes and then &#34;went away&#34;.  April 3, two days after shot, left index finger and left middle finger are shaking (still shaking and has been for last 6 hours).  This was noticed upon waking up and is still occurring.  I am fatigued.

Patient woke from sleep at 0100 on 3/19/21 to find his top lip significantly swollen.  He was able to breath and talk.  He took Benadryl 50mg at home before coming to the ED.  He maintained his airway the entire encounter and the swelling was contained in his lips.  He received Depo-Medrol 80 mg IM x 1 and Zyrtec 20mg PO x 1 and was observed.  His swelling resolved and he was discharged with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg with a tapering dose over 4 days.  He was advised not receive the second dose of COVID vaccine at this time.

                                                I felt one small tingle in my left hand (I am right-handed) and I had a funny taste in my mouth.  Later that night, after eating, I started feeling a tingling sensation in my arms and back. It seemed to get worse after I ate some oatmeal cookies cooked with flour shortly before bed. Early the next morning, the tingling developed into itchy skin on my back, shoulders, and arms.  I am not really breaking out and I am making sure to stay hydrated.  I am hypothesizing that the side effects I am experiencing may be due to consuming refined flour and refined sugars that my body cannot metabolize.  At least for now, I plan to stay away from refined sugars and flours until my 2nd dose of the Moderna shot.  Day 2: I woke up on my left side and the pinky and ring fingers on my left hand were asleep. I went back to sleep on my back and woke up with fingers on my left and right side asleep. As I got ready for work, I experienced trapezius muscle soreness.

Results came back negative on sunday AM on 4/18. My tongue had gotten worse, and I was also now experiencing sinus pressure and ear pain. I went to the pharmacy minit clinic. They diagnosed the tongue pain and sores as thrush, and saw ear fluid. They felt there could be an infection going on. Nystatin oral suspension and Amoxicillin-Clav 875-125 were prescribed. About an hour after coming home, I started experiencing symptom  of Bells Palsy which progressed to fully affecting my right side of my face.  I saw my PCP on 4/19 and he confirmed Bells Palsy.

                                                After both the first and second vaccine shots, I had the same reaction.  15 to 20 minutes after the shot, I felt a numbness in my mouth.  I also had a slight throat constriction sensation that I know well given my history with severe allergic reactions to tree nuts.  However, to be clear, the reaction to the vaccine shots was far more mild than my reaction to tree nuts.  If I eat any tree nuts, I have a severe reaction that involves throat closure, hives, vomiting and related symptoms for 6-8 hours.  While the Epipen shot helps with keeping my throat open, it does not reduce all of the other symptoms.  Here, the throat constriction was only approx. 1/100th of the reaction I have when I eat tree nuts.  Further, the slight throat constriction and mouth numbness only lasted 10-15 minutes, as compared to 6-8 hours if I eat tree nuts. I did not need to use an Epipen.

                                                Experienced Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SSNHL) in the left ear beginning in early morning on March 24, 2021. Hearing loss occurred over the course of approximately 1 hour. Initial care sought through an urgent care on March 24, followed by my primary care physician on March 26, and then emergency room on March 27. Emergency room consulted with Dr and began treatment with oral course of prednisone, 50mg tablet once per day for a total of 6 days. Referred to Dr, ENT, on an emergent basis. Full audiological testing performed on March 29 at Dr office showed profound hearing loss (80-110 db) across all frequencies in left ear, with a speech recognition of 0%. Also experienced aural fullness and tinnitus in left ear. Received intratympanic injections of dexamethasone at Dr office on March 29, April 6 and April 15. I began to notice extremely gradual improvement of ability to hear starting on March 30, with slow incremental improvement continuing to date, but so far only partial recovery has occurred. A second full audiological assessment was performed on April 15 at Dr office, and results showed left ear hearing had improved to &#34;asymmetric mild sloping to profound&#34; hearing loss (25 -95 db from low to high frequencies), speech recognition improved to 48%. Complete recovery has been described as unlikely, but final recovery level is unknown and will be assessed in the coming months - most recovery from SSNHL occurs in the initial month following onset. Next appointment will be in 6 months to assess final hearing level in left ear and discuss amplification (hearing aid) if necessary.

                                                First dose on 3/5/2021 received with minor issues of slight pain in injection site later, but also some tingling in injection site. SECOND DOSE on 4/2/2021 was a different story.  About 15 hours later at 3:00 am I woke up with 100.5 fever, SEVERE pain at injection site (like someone had punched me in the arm and bruised my arm), and SEVERE level 9 (out of 10) pain in all joints in my hand and two big toes.  Fibromyalgia muscular pain SEVERE level 9.  Headache, SEVERE fatigue - could not get out of bed very well.  SEVERE brain fog - I could barely think logically.  I tried taking 50mg full spectrum CBD oil to avoid taking an NSAID (I was concerned it would affect proper immune response).  At 6:29 am the fever was lower, but I could no longer take the pain, so I took 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil).  4-6 hours later took another 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil) and stayed in bed and slept several times that day.  For the next two days the severe brain fog and severe fatigue remained.  I continued to take 400mg Advil as needed.  The brain fog was so severe that if I picked up my keys (or any other object), I would immediately ?lose? them and not know where they were because I had placed them somewhere else and could not remember anything.  I stayed home for at least 72 hours due to the fatigue and the fear of driving and possibly getting in an accident.  It seems the high severity of the issues lasted 72 hours, but all of the above reported issues continued for several weeks at a lower severity - with fatigue being the worst - requiring one or two naps per day.  As of today, April 29, there is still slight pain in all hand joints and some fatigue, but there seems to be gum issues (hurting) since about April 26th.  I am brushing my teeth lightly, using ?Smart Mouth? zinc oral rinse, and sucking/chewing on a whole clove every once in a while for pain relief and for the anti-biotic properties.  I did not contact my physician because I read online that people with Fibromyalgia have worse side effects and I figured the effects would subside over time.  I have an upcoming appointment with my doctor on May 26, 2021 at which time I will report these side effects and my strong concern about any future booster shots and the severe side effects I may encounter.

Since then have been perfectly fine, except for a sensation of blood pulsing in the left outer ear. It feels like I now have a pulse point at the entrance to my ear, so much so that I hear it audibly. This has been constant since 3 days after my 2nd dose to now. It is uncomfortable and concerning.

The headache is at the base of my skull/top of my neck and behind my eyes.  It was chronic for several weeks but now comes and goes but happens a couple to several times each day.  (2) I have been fatigued since the second injeciton on 3/25/2021.  Prior to the second injeciton on 3/25/2021, I had to take between 3mg to 9mg of Melatonin to be able to sleep each night.  Since the second injeciton on 3/25/2021 I have only had to take Melatonin 3 times.  I am chronically tired.  (3) I have intermitent blurred vision that comes and goes.

The next day more hives appeared on his chest and back. 2 days after shot hives were on forehead, chest, back, neck, forearms, legs. Some were flat and some were raised and blister like (some appeared like chicken pox). 3 days after shot hives (flat and blister like) covered his body including face except the groin area. He also had some redness to the whites of his eyes-he went to the emergency room. The hives were itchy, not painful. He did not experience any difficulty breathing. As of today he no longer has any blister like hives but does still have many red splotches left on his back and chest and arms-they are fainter but still present.

Called 911 and paramedic took EKG and informed me I was having a heart attack on the way to the hospital.  Once at the hospital they measured my TnT-Gen5 and the baseline was 2658 ng/L with another test taken an hour later showing 2873 ng/L which led to additional tests listed in box 19.  Final diagnosis was perimyocarditis and I received a prescription of Colchicine 0.6 MG to be taken twice a day for 6 weeks and then follow up with a cardiologist.

Peaked with chills and sweats 16 hours post injections.  Fatigue for the next two days.  Cold sore appeared 2 days post injection. Tinnitus noticed  (double pre-existing tinnitus levels) 20 hours post injection.  Tinitus still present over 30 days later. Checked permanent damage box because I have no way to know if the tinnitus will subside.  The tinnitus is what reminded me/prompted me to submit this.

The new and persistent symptom is tinnitus.  I have had incessant ringing in my ears since receiving the vaccine, something I did not previously experience.  The ringing has continued unabated since April 2021.

                                                Approximately two weeks follow the first vaccination, my sense of taste  and smell to a lesser degree, has changed. It has worsened following the second vaccination. It primarily affects certain food types (starches like potato based foods, corn, certain grains, nuts, sweetened sodas). Certain smells have been affected as well, the most noticeable is related to celery which has become overpowering. Also, the smells of the aforementioned foods are also different.

He was observed for 15mins without any noticeable concerns noted. He was scheduled for his 2nd vaccine and released. Member returned to 2nd floor conference room C at 4:37pm as he indicated his tongue felt thick and swallowing wasn&#39;t &#34;natural&#34;. He advised he sat in his car for a while and came back in and took 2 benadryl.  I escorted member down to ACC and handed him off with report. He was in no acute distress, able to talk and ambulate. While checking into ACC he indicated he felt the benadryl was helping and felt a little better. (Initially during the 15 minute observation, member advised his mouth was dry and asked for water, which after drinking he said he was fine and that it helped. He was in no distress at that time. )

                                                My Tinnitus went up very next day which is 70% higher then prior taking the shot.  Also on Friday 03/19 my left arm where i got the shot show sign of red color rash and now I have pain inside my armpit which has not gone away till this day.  Tinnitus and pain is major concern at this point due to taking Moderna shot.

                                                headache and body aches night of shot. Took one acetaminophen before bed at 10:00pm.  Bad night of sleep.  Woke up next day with headache, body ache and blurry peripheral vision issue with right eye. Took another acetaminophen and slept more.  By the 8pm on Thursday the headache and body aches were gone.  Eye issue continued. Applied saline drops to the eyes over the weekend.  No change. Monday morning placed a call to Ophthalmology.  Dr. saw me that day.  He said the eyes looked healthy.  Thought it could be inflammation in the eye muscles.  Suggest taking Aleve for 2 days and come back on Wednesday (4/7/21). No change in blurred vision. Suggested I get in touch with my primary doctors office.  Saw the NP today.  He is prescribing a steroid.

Degree of vertigo strong for entire first day undeniably present/persistent and varies (slightly improved, then worsens again) since day 8. Able to get through day but disturbing. Extremely healthy otherwise,  extremely athletically capable.  Nothing unusual in diet or sleep or activity or stress in recent days.  SYMPTOM 2 - Ringing ears on day 11, and increasing on day 12.  This too - never before of any significance in entire life.  Could it be related to the vertigo symptoms?  Feels like it is.  *** Please take note! *** Hard to dismiss as unrelated.  I&#39;m just one.  You have the sample data.  Seems as though auditory/balance nerves are getting a beating somehow.  This is NOT an exasperated pre-existing condition.  The shoulder soreness / tiredness - was a 1 day matter quickly resolved.  This is more insidious and persistent and debilitating.

I was unable to swallow for the first minute or so, then my upper and lower lip got numb. After I was able to swallow   my saliva tasted metallic and a mental fog settled in.  I had difficulty concentrating for the next 2-3 minutes.  All symptoms lasted for  about 5 minutes.  About a week later I developed a skin rash reminiscent to a &#34;zoster.&#34;   It was the size of my palm on my left thigh. Although is almost clear now, the affected skin area lost some sensitivity. Another subcutaneous inflammation persist to present day.

                                                State opened Covid vaccines to 50 and over on Mon, March 22. I immediately scheduled my appointment for a first shot at a Dept of Health site near me for Wed, March 24. I had no immediate negative side effects. When I woke on Fri, March 26 and commenced my day of remote work from home, I noticed my left eye vision was blurry. I proceeded to work that day and continued my normal activities into the weekend assuming my vision would self-correct. By Sunday, March 26, my left eye vision was still noticeably problematic so I scheduled to see an optometrist whom I had seen before. I saw him at 12:15pm on Tues, March 30. After running numerous vision tests, optometrist let me know my vision loss in the left eye seemed to be the result of a stroke that had cut blood flow in the optic nerve and damaged my vision in the lower portions of the left eye. The center and upper portions of my left eye were generally unaffected at that time. He suggested I see my primary care physician to check for vitals, such as blood pressure and do other blood work, and more importantly see a neuro ophthalmologist urgently.   The next morning, Wed, March 31 I saw my PCP, who informed me my blood pressure was normal, requested blood work, and gave me a prescription for an MRI of my brain, with and without contrast. I am 6&#39;2&#34; and I weighed at 239, about where it has been for most of last 15 years. I also complained of pain and stiffness in my front right thigh and lower right back. She said if I didn&#39;t get an appointment to see a neuro ophthalmologist that same afternoon, she recommended I go to an ER. With the help of Optometrist&#39;s office, I was able to get an appointment that day with Dr., neuro ophthalmologist at 2:15pm on Wed, March 31. His office repeated numerous vision tests and confirmed the left eye vision loss (essentially the lower half excluding the center) and diagnosed it as a NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. With this diagnosis, there was no treatment, and I scheduled a follow-up for May 12. He said that my optic nerve into my left eye would slowly reduce its swelling over the next 6 to 8 weeks and in that time, my vision could remain the same, or improve. At that point, I didn&#39;t think it would worsen, but sadly that later happened. In addition to the the first MRI that PCP prescribed, Neuro ophthalmologist prescribed a second MRI of orbits, with and without contrast. He also suggested I begin taking a low dose Aspirin daily, which I did.   The next week, the blood work revealed a very slightly elevated cholesterol reading. I was told by my PCP on April 5 that this would normally not be considered as a problematic level of high cholesterol, but should be improved or lowered. The blood tests taken at Lab on Fri, April 2 revealed a LDL Chol, Calculated as 111, whereby &lt;100 was considered desirable range. Other than that, there was nothing of concern in my blood work. The two MRIs were done on April 9 and April 20, and did not reveal findings which doctors felt would have impacted my optic nerve swelling or had caused the eye stroke. Out of precaution, I scheduled to see a cardiologist on Tues, April 13. She recommended I start taking Crestor for cholesterol, and do a series of tests which I completed on Friday, April 23 - echocardiogram; holter monitor; transesophageal echocardiogram; and ultrasound carotid bilateral. As of today, Mon, April 26 I do not know the results of the cardio work-up, but both neuro ophthalmologists I saw felt that a problem related to my heart would not have caused this stroke in my eye.   Finally, on Fri, April 23 I had a consultation with a second highly recommended neuro ophthalmologist. After a series of vision tests, she agreed with other doctor&#39;s diagnosis of NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. She also said there was nothing I could do to treat except wait for the next 4 or more weeks for the optic nerve swelling to go down. She also confirmed my fear which was that my left eye vision had worsened since March 31 as my vision loss was no longer limited to the lower portion of my left eye, but now included blind spots throughout the upper range of my left eye vision, making my loss of peripheral vision worse and more widespread. She said in some cases with NAION, a patient&#39;s vision could remain the same, could improve or could worsen in the 6 to 8 weeks after the event. Four weeks after the March 26 event, by April 23 my left eye vision had worsened. I still hold out hope that it can improve some in the next four weeks... My right eye vision was not affected in any way, although one risk of NAION is that there is a 20% (?) chance it may recur in the next 5 years, and if it does, it most commonly affects the other, good eye.   None of the doctors I saw directly attributed my vision loss to the Moderna vaccine taken on March 24; however, there has also not been a clear cause determined by my doctors. While most of the doctors I saw seemed to think it coincidental, none also was able to absolutely rule it out either as a cause or a trigger. Dr. suggested I follow through with this idea, which other medical professionals suggested, to submit this vaccine adverse event report. Without a doubt, this was an adverse effect and/or problem that occurred soon after (36 hours approximately) taking the first dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving vaccine I broke out in a cold sweat and was dizzy. That lasted for about ten minutes. The next day I woke up to pain running from the right side of my jaw to my right ear. The injection site in my right arm was more sore than any other vaccine shot I have ever had. The glands in my neck were swollen and my right side shoulder and neck area were sore. I experienced waves of fatigue over the next four days. The pain to my ear that seemed to mimic a really bad ear infection continued for six days. I went to the minute clinic at the Pharmacy where I received the shot and was checked out. There was nothing wrong with my ear and they could not find anything wrong with me other than my glands were swollen and I had a general amount of swelling on the right side of my next going into my shoulder. While the pain in my ear has lessened some it is still there now eight days after the vaccination. I have also experienced some GI issues. I am extremely regular and do not have issue going to the bathroom. My gut was not normal and I did not have normal bowl movements for more than a week. I also have had something akin to a rash on my arms that looks like prickly heat. It seemed to me that my immune system overreacted to the vaccine. I have contended for months now that I had Covid back in March of 2020 right before the shutdown. I believe I caught it during business travel at the very beginning of March 2020. My concern is whether I should get the second Moderna shot if my immune system is already this revved up with antibodies.

I tool Tylenol as directed it would only reduce temps to 101 after 2 hours the fever 104 would return. This lasted until late morning the next day my temps started to fall off to 99. Tiredness and headaches still a problem been 3 days since the Moderna 2nd vaccine shot. I also feel some inner ear pressure like some inflammation in there.  The headaches seem to be getting somewhat worse causing me to feel nauseated I took 500 MG of Ibuprofen seems to reduce the headaches. I also developed a cough dry but almost like a flu cough which seems to be resolving.

                                                Twenty minutes after injection of the second Moderna vaccine the patient lost vision in both of his eyes. and went to the ER for eval.  They told him to see an ophthalmologist after ruling out stroke etc. Patient saw an ophthalmologist and told to get CT scan after papilledema was diagnosed with vision of HM OD and 20/100 OS.  Sent to ER for CT scan which was negative and diagnosed with MS/ optic neuropahty and given IV steroids and oral steroids with improvment of vision.   Currently on PO steroids and vision is improving.  Seen by me last Friday with papilledema remaining in both eyes.

Mild ringing in both ears that began  the night of the 2nd day after second shot. Ringing decreased and stopped in the left ear and increased to a very loud ringing in only the right ear. I went to see a general medicine doctor, then an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor. She had a hearing test conducted that showed hearing loss in my right ear. The ENT has me scheduled to an MRI today. I went to the MRI, but could not continue because of an increased feeling of dizziness, faintness and severe nausea. I am scheduling an open MRI.

                                                Around 04/30/2021 I ended up getting some facial paralysis, a pretty quick onset on the left side of my face. I started to notice I had some difficulty shutting my eye. I wasn&#39;t having any slurred speech. I recognized it as a possible Bells Palsy because I have coworkers that have it. My eye sight started to become more affected. I went to the ER that same day to rule out stroke. They ran blood tests and CT scan to rule out any signs of stroke. Everything came back negative and they found no cause for paralysis and assumed it was bells palsy. . I was put on prednisone and an anti-viral drug Baclamir (something that started with B ) . I was on about a weeks worth of the anti viral and about 10 days of the prednisone, and the first 8 days I was showing signs of improvement .  I couldn&#39;t shut my left eye, raise my eyebrow, my whole face was numb on L side and I lost taste on L side of tongue. They did test me for Covid when I went to ER. I had a metallic taste in my mouth. I took medicine and recovered quickly but within 3-7 days, I ended up getting a rash on my back but it wasn&#39;t a regular rash because it didn&#39;t itch. It was the worst back acne possible, around 200 bumps on back that erupted overnight. The ER did r/o shingles but this rash was on several different nerve paths, it looked more like a reaction to the prednisone. I am an Archeologist and they ran a test to see if I had lyme disease because I come across ticks regularly but they came back negative for current and past infection.  When I take Amoxicillin I do get heart palpitations and that&#39;s why I was on the doxycycline. I do take testosterone 1 shot a month in the hip. On the 8th day around 05/08/2021  it started to improve and every day after that was a 5% improvement.

                                                Very mild but noticeable numbness in tongue towards back of tongue (not front) on either side.  Seemed to dissipate after six hours.  Was not immediately noticeable and seemed to be more pronounced about 1/2 hour after injection.  I had the other expected soreness at injection site and general malaise approximately 24 hours after  - 96 hours after vaccine and I am only reporting this as I was not expecting the numbness in the tongue and was not sure if it was an adverse effect or just stress related.

                                                So basically I believe I have Bell&#39;s palsy  .  After about an hour after receiving the vaccine I noticed I was having a weird taste in my mouth. Sort of a metallic taste. As the weekend went on it seemed to get worse. Then Monday morning I noticed when brushing my teeth that I wasn?t able to  gurgle my mouth wash. And saw that my mouth and eye seemed to be drooping slightly. Now Thursday the 21st and it seems to be effecting my speech to were I now have a lisp. Can definitely see it when I?m speaking to someone. Which people have commented on.  Not sure what can be done . But at this point I?m hoping it doesn?t get worse. Thanks

Patient felt as though throat may have been closing so he administered an epi pen to himself. As no immediate relief patient administered a second epi pen which provided relief. Approximately one hour after vaccination patient felt back to normal and chose to leave the clinic with instructions to report to emergency room if symptoms began to return.

                                                Afew hours after receiving the inoculation, I was extremely sleepy.   I was sleeping at my job, and my boss had me go home early.  I went to work the next day, however I was feeling weird, my sense of smell and taste were off, as the day continued I started having a headache, body aches, and general malaise.  I went home early, again from work.  But when I arrived to my residence I was having severe chills despite my efforts to try to keep myself warm.  The chills lasted for more than 24hrs, preventing me from sleeping, my body aches were getting worse, my eyes were extremely red, and I did not feel like eating.  Near the end of the day, the chills became sweats, and I was trying to balance between being hot and clammy, to chills.  The next day I paid a visit to my primary care doctor.  I was tested for covid - which was negative, I was tested for the flu - which was negative, and my lungs were clear so there was no reason for my doctor to believe I have a pneumonia.

He has not had any sickness with in the last year., including the common cold. The antibiotics have not helped the ringing ears at all after 4 days. We are hoping this goes away but so far there is no improvement. He has been unable to work while this is going on.

I noticed there is a feeling of pressure in the ear area. I now have a heavy ringing with some random &#34;ticking&#34; in the ear. I am not able to hear anything short of really loud noises that sound like metallic screeching.

                                                Patient did say before vaccine that he has fainted in the past from previous vaccines. I had a Representative administer vaccine while i stood next to patient and talked with him as a distraction from the shot. After Representative gave the vaccine patient asked &#34;did you give vaccine?&#34;, he then immediately started to sweat very hard and said he was light headed (he was sitting down), then his eyes rolled back and he slouched down in chair, at which point I held him so he did not fall on floor. He started to jerk and twitch, perhaps was having a seizure, and was sweating very hard. I held him in chair so he would not hit his head or get hurt. After about 30 seconds he regained consciousness and asked how long he was out. His T-shirt was soaked in sweat and he said he felt very dizzy. The Representative got him an ice pack and placed at base of neck, which he said helped alot.  I sat with him for 10-15 minutes until he said he felt fine. I asked if he needed medical care and he said he did not, just needed to sit for awhile, and said this has happened before. I gave him a chair to sit in after he was fully alert and he sat for close to half an hour, at which point he said he was back to himself and felt fine.  I did offer he could stay as long as needed and I could call anyone if he needed me too, he insisted he was fine and after about 45 minutes he left. I did call him the next day to check on him and he said he was fine.

                                                Odd sensation on tongue shortly after vaccination.  By the next day issues with taste - diminished and foods tasted &#34;off&#34;.  The taste issues largely resolved within 7-10 days.  (Some fatigue on days 2-4 after vaccine.) Due to taste issue, had a covid test which was negative.  The sensation on the tongue is always present but sometimes feels like a sore in a particular location, sometimes, feels like the tongue was burned by a hot beverage, and sometimes is just a vague sense of discomfort. Typically on the left side (shot in left arm), sometimes in the middle, rarely on right.  Location is tip of tongue or the top of tongue near tip.   Have seen Family Medicine Doctor who thought taste buds were inflamed. Dentist and ENT have said tongue/mouth look normal on exam. Family Medicine doctor and ENT said to report as possible vaccine side effect, and ENT stated that he believes vaccine is cause.

We are already the 14th of April and headache has not gone away once.  Body aches and joint pain are still present.  Snapping my fingers hurts the joints in my hand.  Walking hurts my knees.  Fatigue has set in and is still present.  VERY tired all the time.  All I want to do is sleep.  Dizziness all morning.  Taking about 2 to 3 hours for dizziness to go away.  But present again at intervals during the day then again the next day.  This has gone on since day two of shot.  Dry mouth.  I am drinking LOTS of water.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Open heart surgery. Concomitant products included POTASSIUM, FUROSEMIDE (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]), WARFARIN, METOPROLOL SUCCINATE (TOPROL XL), MINERALS NOS, VITAMINS NOS (PRENATAL VITAMINS [MINERALS NOS;VITAMINS NOS]), CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) and ESCITALOPRAM OXALATE (LEXAPRO) for an unknown indication.    On 11-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required), VERTIGO (Room spinning) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required). The patient was hospitalized from 19-Mar-2021 to 21-Mar-2021 due to TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. On 21-Mar-2021, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack), VERTIGO (Room spinning) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient received vaccine in right non-dominate deltoid muscle to prevent COVID-19. Patient was admitted to hospital from 19Mar2021 to 21Mar2021 for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scan, with observation and Low-Dose Aspirin. Patient was feeling much better and his cardiologist recommended that he receives his second Moderna vaccine as soon as required and to take an extra Vitamin D supplement as a precaution.

                                                15 minutes after the shot, I became lightheaded in the waiting area and felt like I was going to black out.  I seemed fine after, and shrugged it off as I sometimes experience this on a rare occasion. Thought it was my anxiety from all the drama hearing about side effects. They kept me for 40 minutes and asked me a few questions and felt that I looked and acted normal.  My ride home, my vision seemed &#34;off&#34; and again, I shrugged it off to anxiety.  I also had light heart palpitations.  I get these sometime when I&#39;m stressed, overly tired, too much coffee, or have anxiety.  I wasn&#39;t dizzy at all, but my balance felt a tad &#34;off&#34;  I was much better in the morning and back to normal within about 24hrs.   I am worried about geting my 2nd shot as I read people being dizzy and with super high blood pressures......  Hoping these &#34;symptoms&#34; were just from myself getting worked up about..... possible side effects and allergic reactions.

No Medical History information was reported.    On 09-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PAROSMIA (smelled an antiseptic smell / smells a chemicals all day and night/still persisting) (seriousness criterion medically significant), SKIN ODOUR ABNORMAL (showered and still smelled it/showered and still smelled it\ band-aid smell) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and MYALGIA (Arm has minor soreness) (seriousness criterion medically significant).

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medication was reported. The treatment information was unknown.  This patient is going to continue to call Moderna until he gets a call back from the Safety department. Patient is very frustrated and bothered that Moderna has not made more information public even though millions of vaccines have been administered.  He feels he is in a rare side effect group and that this information should be taken more serious.  He has seen a specialist regarding his side effect which has not gone away after his first vaccine over 90 days ago.  He states he &#34;smells a chemical smell all day and night, it started immediately after receiving the vaccine&#34;.  This has been the worst experience for this patient and he wishes he never got the vaccine. Patient explains that his doctor said the mRNA has woven itself into the endothelial cells and that&#39;s why he is smelling these strange cells&#34;.   Follow-up 2: patient reported after receiving the 1st dose of Moderna vaccine. this was the fourth time the call was made. Caller mentioned, that I contacted the HCP as per Moderna advise, and the doctor has no information for the adverse reaction I developed after the vaccination and mentioned, that the mRNA grafted in to patient&#39;s olfactory Celia and in to my own DNA. Also mentioned if this adverse reaction of &#34;antiseptic Smell&#34; , persisting more than 60 days time period , then its going to remain with him for ever. So patient is very upset and safety  Company comment: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He states about 24hrs after receiving the 1st covid shot, he has had headache ,ears hurt, and bumps and they bust open on his head. He showed me his head  several grape size bumps with scabs. The one on top of his head busted and ran down the back of his neck and he got the biggest one. He showed it to me it is a large bump the size of a large egg and is ozzing yellow/clear puss on the rt back of his neck. I told him I have not heard of that being a reaction, and he needs to go directly to his PCP or the emergency room. It could possibly be staff and it is urgent he see a Dr. today. Client states he has seen PCP. He was headed to the clinic to see if she would see him or send him to the ER. I will follow up with him on Friday morning to see if he received medical attention.

                                                After receiving my first dose, I started to have a humming in my ears. It would be like plugging in a electric guitar to a speaker. It was constant. I went to my doctor before my second dose and he performed my annual and I had a hearing test. My ears were completely clean and he did an audio toner test. He told me that my hearing is perfectly fine. I went and got my second dose and the sound went away. It feels like I&#39;m waiting for my ears to pop. I take a Claritin and Ultimately, I want to say that it has moments where it lessens and creeps up at times. This all started in my left in, moved to my right ear and sometimes it&#39;s in both. I&#39;ve never had any issues with my ears before. I feel like there is a constant pressure build up inside my ear.

On Saturday 1/23/21 I woke up with hives on my left arm and chest and a swelling on my left eye.  I took benadryl which had no effect. The next day the hives had progressed to blisters, my hand swelled  and my eye had almost swollen shut.  I contacted my health care advisers and they prescribed predinosne.  This reversed the reaction and the wounds are healing.  I have pictures of how I looked.

I mostly felt ill throughout the day with low-grade fever, fatigue, body aches.  This continued on Sunday, January 31, 2021 and Sunday evening, I noticed a small droop in the upper lip on the right side of my mouth.  When I awakened, Monday, February 1, 2021, I had full right-side paralysis of the face, severe right eye, right jaw and right ear pain, severe fatigue, continued body aches.  After going to the ER where tests were performed to rule out stroke and sepsis, I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                I had a really bad day after the second dose. Horrible migraine headache that built as the day moved on.  As a rule, I do not get migraines and whenever I have gotten a headache I&#39;ve not had a  sensitivity to light or sound, like I did yesterday.  It was just miserable. Lots of body ache and a generalized feeling of sickness, similar to influenza or food poisoning.  I had no energy.   My arm at the injection site hurt constantly without even being touched all day and I could not sleep on my left side due to arm pain around the injection site. The arm pain from the injection site, occasionally radiated to my elbow joint , depending on how I moved my arm.  It is still sensitive today, two days later, and has a sensitive swelling in the area where the injection occurred. I do not feel bad today, but I do feel like I am 100% yet, either, but I feel a LOT better than I did yesterday.

                                                Started with numbness and tingling in the left side of my face, lips and tongue. Went to ER (5:00 PM 2/25/21).  They did bloodwork and 2 CT scans. CT scans were inconclusive so I was transferred (9:45 PM 2/25/21), admitted and an MRI scheduled for 24 hours later. MRI (12:00 AM 2/27/21) was negative for stroke. Beginning stages of Bells Palsy was diagnosed. Prescribed Prednisone, Lipitor, Valtrex,  and baby aspirin upon discharge 1:45 PM 2/27/21).  By 2/28/21  symptoms had increased to the point where I can not suck through a straw, speaking is difficult and overall, extreme loss of muscle control in my face and feel like I have a bad head cold.

Left arm at injection site sore.  Details:  approximately 1 am I woke up with chills, headache, earache and tiredness.    I took Tylenol and this continued waking up again a few hours later the same.   Eventually I felt very hot.   Upon waking again tired/fatigue, headache, earache.   At approximately 11:30 am I got out of bed,  shaky &amp; very tired.   I eventually felt better, just tired.   (With exception of Arm still hurting).    Please note I had Covid in December and had similar symptoms, except these all hit me at the same time and felt much worse then when I had Covid.

A couple of days after the first dose I noticed my ears were ringing more then usual. It has been very annoying and bothersome. I am very concerned if they will continue ringing this loudly. I am not going to get the 2nd dose. I am very much hoping as the vaccine wears off that my ears will get better.

Very loud ringing in the head.  The ringing has been so loud that kept me up one complete night with no sleep and hard to sleep since then. I have gone to the family doctor end my ENT specialist. I wear hearing aids and have seen the ENT before. Hoping they could tell me why this has suddenly gotten so much worse. This has been going on  over 3 weeks now. I never thought it could be related to the vaccine and may not even be. Just too coincidental that immediate issues shortly after vaccination. I just want officially report in hopes of gathering data and possibly helping others.

                                                Three days after receiving my first dose of Moderna, I noticed this loud noise and sensation from what appeared to be coming from my left ear and head.  Coincidentally,  I received my vaccine shot on my left shoulder, and my left ear is effected. I made an appointment to see my ENT Doctor three days later to be told that my hearing test came back normal, but I had tinnitus. I have never experienced this before, and wanted to report  it because it did not occur  until I had my first vaccine shot. I am now 16-days in after my first shot, and the sound has not eased up, but has gotten worst and is continuous 24/7. I cannot sleep with the constant buzzing and humming in my ear, and I am unable to concentrate.

                                                I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy on 04/13/2021 at a Urgent Care, and all my bloodwork came back negative.  I am currently taking Valtrex (1GM tab 3xs/day)  and Prednison (1 50mg/day), plus eye drops.  I woke that morning having trouble drinking and eating and when I looked at my face, could see that something was wrong.  My face (left) has not gone back to normal and my left eye is watery and seems sensitive to light.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Had Tinnitus starting about 5 hours after the 1st dose shot. Started on left ear (same side as shot on left arm). The noise was more like &#39;whooshing&#39; sound than a &#39;ring&#39;. Lasted about 10 seconds. Then came back couple hours later. This cycle repeated for about 48 hrs, then gradually dissipated after 3rd day. Now at 1 week before 2nd dose, no sign of tinnitus, so will take the 2nd shot. However, Moderna and CDC should report Tinnitus as potential side effect instead of hiding information. Give the people information, so they can make a choice based on facts and weigh in all pros and cons.

I am unable to get the lot number of the vaccine because it was entered through the state  system and the lot number did not go over. No lot number is associated with the vaccine.

He went out side for a little bit, his body temperature was still hot without chills and this lasted for 3 days and night. I talked to the pharmacist and he recommended Ibuprofen and I gave it to him for two days but he kept the fever. He started shaking and by the 5th day I took him to the clinic and both his eyes were red and hands and feet were hot. I was told to take him home because all vital signs were ok, but I took him back to the ER on day 8 because he was not getting better, they said he had multi organ issues and now he&#39;s confused and he doesn&#39;t know who I am or where he is and cannot remember and confused. He is now on dialysis and he was on life support, he was never hospitalized or taken prescription drugs and now he&#39;s in this condition. He is still in ICU and his body looks so weird.  He don&#39;t remember words or when I talk to him.

                                                I received first Moderna vaccine shot (Lot # 011L20A) on Jan 6, 2021 and received second Moderna vaccine shot (031L20A) on Feb 3, 2021 at approx. 2:15pm Approximately 36 hours later, at 2am last night while sleeping, the left side of mouth (upper &amp; lower lips) swelled up for unknown reason(s).   I ate dinner at approx. 6pm, and had salad, steak and green beans, all of which I have eaten before without any side effects I don&#39;t believe it is a food allergy and I have not experience any trauma to my lips or face.  At approximately 5:30am, I took 2 Benadryl, in an attempt to reduce swelling.  As of 8am, the swelling is still evident.  Other than swollen lips, only other reaction to shot is minor soreness by the injection site in my left arm.  I am not sure if there is a correlation between the vaccine and my swollen lips, but I&#39;ve never had swollen lips before. Only other reason, for the swelling,  I could think of would by possible spider bite but I feel that is unlikely. If swelling persists, I will contact my doctor.

                                                I had pain in arm from injection immediately, after injection, which was much different than first dose.  But not unexpected.  But the adverse symptoms started about 5 hours in or so, i developed a cough, and dyspnea, it was tight in my chest, hard to breathe.  the cough was/is (it remains), sometimes hard and raspy, i was a bit wheezy, and I had air hunger, like i could not breathe or get air.  if i exhale to strongly i cough, if i talk to much i cough, if i sing i cough, if i inhale too deeply i cough.  I also have been very dizzy since the shot and vertigo.  I am still coughing and it is 5 days post shot.    I started developing headache and severe body pain, pain in  my spine, low back and joints.  which is expected, but i also had scalp pain and it hurt to be even touched the slightest bit on my scalp and everywhere on my body.  I had very stiff neck and eye socket pain as well.  I also feel &#34;funny&#34; in my head.  LIke dizzy, and vertigo, but also like it is wrapped in a heavy towel and my eyes feel heavy and like i can&#39;t see well.  my vision is as if it has diminshed.    5 hours after shot cough started, and the dyspnea, i started feeling chills and deep squeezing ache in my arm at jab site, and soon had fever of 100.6, over night it went to 100.8 and i felt terrible, headache, body ache, restless.  but next day fever was 102.  it remained all day, i had zero energy slept the whole day.  no appetite, did not eat anything except a scramble egg which made me nausea.  fever remained all day at 101.8. over night.  next day temp was 99.8 (my normal is 97.6) and it was 99.8 all day.  Cough was persistent and really bad with the dyspnea this whole time and i still have cough 5 days out, just giving a timeline here.  by friday, my temp was 98 but i felt extreemly fatigued.  I went and got a covid test which was negative.  i saw the chiropractor and they helped my back and headache a little bit.  went home and rested.  cough has lingered, dizzy lingers, chest tight and sob lingers.  fatigue lingers.   Cough and dyspnea are NOT signs, the sheet i got for V-safe says right on it these are NOT expected.

                                                Patient had usual post vaccination myalgias and lethargy for a few days after injection.  These resolved spontaneously.  However, about a week after vaccination he developed recurrent fevers 102°F.  He also had complaints of body aches and bilateral jaw pain.  He had extensive evaluation including laboratory testing for infectious etiologies of his fever and none was identified.  He was noted to have very high sed rate and CRP.  When no specific etiology for his fevers could be identified we decided to proceed with a short course of prednisone which did seem to help his fever and jaw pain.  After prednisone was stopped he had recurrence of fever and developed worse jaw pain and pain at the base of his neck. I examined him in clinic and found that he had a tender swollen thyroid.  I directed him to the emergency department where CT scanning of his neck confirmed evidence of thyroiditis.  TSH was undetectable and free T4 was about 2 times higher than normal.  He was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis.  However, his symptomatology seemed quite dramatic for subacute thyroiditis, and the timing in relation to his vaccination is concerning for possible adverse vaccine reaction.

                                                after about 30 minutes, I started having a metallic taste in my mouth.  I was also experiencing soreness in left arm area.   After about an hour, the pain in my arm started to feel as though it was spreading to my left chest cavity area.  I then started to get chest pains in the left breast area to the armpit area, but not severe, just concerning.  After probably 70-80 minutes, I started feeling drowsy.  I continued to feel drowsy all evening and did not sleep well.  I woke up and could not return to sleep at 4:45am.  My normal waking time is 6:00am.  I had/have quite a bit of soreness in my arm, but nothing unbearable.  No signs of rash or inflammation around injection sight.  I am taking a sick day from work to relax and recover from loss of sleep.  The metallic taste persist, but only an annoyance and taste seems to be normal when eating or drinking.  A slight achiness in joints, but a cold front was also moving in, which can cause me to have the same effect.

By lunchtime, I am experiencing extreme fatigue, overall body soreness, loss of appetite, and increased pain at the injection site. By 3 pm I am home and in bed, dealing with chills/sweats as well. Couldn&#39;t find any comfort to sleep thru the night. In the morning of the 29th, I&#39;m still displaying all the issues listed above. I stay home from work and go back to bed. I awake at noon to find all the listed issues greatly reduced, but feel soreness in my jaw and feel swelling in the lymph nodes under the jawbone, more so on the right than the left.

The weather was not overly dry, I was well-hydrated, and I was confused why I would experience a nosebleed.  The bleed was not excessive, and I considered coincidence.  An hour or two later in the late afternoon, my wife noticed that I had a ruptured capillary in my left eye.  She was very concerned since it appeared very bloody even though it did not cause me any significant pain.  The affected eye was mildly itchy afterward.  I was not hit in the eye or scratched it in any way.  I associated the capillary bleeding events as related to each other and potentially related to my vaccination.  However, both events were minor and passed, cleared up in 72 hours.  I have a photo of my eye that is available upon request.

                                                Had pain in my shoulder (and  neck on my left side) as soon as the shot went in. At roughly three hours after the shot, I felt I was slurring my speech (I had to make a very concerted effort to make proper sentences and not slur) and was very dizzy. I also was having a hard time with lights. For example, I was unable to look in the mirror in my bathroom as the lights above the mirror were too bright for me. At three hours after the shot, I had severe pain in my left shoulder. Overall, I felt as I had been sedated or drugged. I tried walking to the nearest convenience store to get some food and I felt I was experiencing vertigo. Several days after the vaccine I had a slight cough and sore throat. I am still experiencing a slight cough on some day sand a slight sore throat.   I had a subtle red patch in the left shoulder area a couple days after the shot. Eight or nine days after the shot, I had covid arm and had a very visible red patch on my left shoulder. I have pictures of this.  I have been feeling very tired and dizzy ever since the first shot. My glands in my neck under my jaw line are also swollen. I do not know if it is either  wise or safe for me to get the second shot, which is scheduled for this Friday as it seems that I still have not recovered from the first shot. Can my immune system really take another round of this?  There are a couple other things that I have noticed. I don&#39;t seem to be thinking very clearly and I have noticed a remarkable number of type-os and poor syntax in emails that I send at work; this is not normal for me.   Finally, after the shot, I noticed that my muscles, when doing a little exertion such as pushups, would build lactic acid quicker and more blood seemed to be delivered to my working muscles. I still have not regained my strength and tire more easierly when playing tennis or hitting against the tennis wall, for example. This is also not normal and not how I felt before the first injection.

Went to the hospital and was checked for a stroke. No stroke detected. While during the exam, my tongue started to swell up and they decided to insert a tube for breathing. Woke up on Sunday after the swelling went down and the tube was removed. Was released from the hospital on Tuesday. Maintained a fever that week and on Friday, my fingers on my left hand and my left foot started to swell again, almost passed out. Went back to the hospital for observation and treatment for a staph infection from the first hospital visit.

                                                After administration of the vaccine (yesterday), patient began to experience itching at the injection site and slight whelps at the injection site.  He said he wasn&#39;t feeling great and reported having cold sweats and hot flashes.  He also had dry mouth that caused him to have difficulty swallowing.  I administered 50mg of diphenhydramine liquid and observed him for over 30 minutes.  I checked his blood pressure three times; it was elevated but within what he said was a normal range for him.  He had not had anything to eat nor taken his bp meds that am.  After 30 minutes, he was feeling some improvement and he and his wife left.  I spoke with her later and she said they had gotten something to eat and gone home and he was sleeping.  I spoke to him again this morning and he said later in the day he felt like his throat was swelling, but he continued to take diphenhydramine and felt better today.  He and I both reported this event to his primary care provider.

                                                Note: May 24, 2021 the pharmacy that administered the COVID vaccines contacted me with some billing questions. When I mentioned my severe reactions, they told me they were filing a report upon my behalf. When done they told me it was the VAERS system and gave me a reference number (Ref-531994). I decided that not enough information would be in that report so wanted to submit myself because of my severe reaction and hospitalization. My PCP was not involved until after hospital for a follow up and I was seen by numerous doctors there, so I have no easy single POC until I dig more.

                                                He got his vaccine, had pain on the side of the injection and from there it grew to feeling aches and pains and then the shivers the next day.  He has had chills/sweating, fever that comes and goes, difficulty breathing as his nostrils block up, and has wheezing and when he gets up he&#39;s light headed and feels like he is going to pass out.  At night the symptoms seem to get worse, and thought that he had the flu.  He has bought everything for the flu and nothing has helped.  He then thought that he may have allergies and bought stuff for that and nothing has helped.  He has lost his sense of taste, he is extremely thirsty and could drink a gallon of water and his stomach hurts from drinking but his mouth is extremely dry and his throat is so dry as well.   He also has a nasty bad headache that is persistent and at night it gets to the point that he cannot seen and had lost his vision and could no see anything out of his right eye.  He called 9-1-1 and refused to go to the ER as he has no insurance and could not afford that kind of bill.  Yesterday his headache was so bad that he could not see out of the left eye, he has a fever of 101.5 right now and his head is killing him.  He has taken all of his medications that he has, medicated and nothing is helping the pain.  His nose is also extremely dry and he has no appetite, and ate last at 5:00 PM yesterday.   He also has vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sweats/chills.  He watches his diet carefully due to the diabetes, but has not measured it.     He is very concerned about his vision and his fever and headache was so bad that he could not see, and he&#39;s worried about that.   He also has brain fog as well, and cannot remember things, pounding, pulsating water.

                                                Shortly after the 2nd shot of Moderna my tongue/taste buds felt ?prickly? and I had a metallic taste in my mouth. The metallic taste went away by the evening but not the tongue sensation. By the evening of the first day I had patches of irritation develop along the edges of my tongue. I didn?t really pay too much attention to it until I ate some hot sauce the next day! I took pictures 2 days after the shot. My symptoms are closest to what has been described as ?Covid tongue?. My tongue symptoms have varied  day to day but haven?t  cleared yet (a month later).

I went to my general physician and regular follow ups with cardiologist and pulmonologist. They did EKG, Cardio sonogram, usual set of breathing tests and lung CT scan. They increased my dose of Trelegy and cardiologist included Aspirin.

I fell to the ground striking my head against the wall and hearing the sound of my body hitting the scale on the floor. I sat up and sat still for what seemed like 30 seconds wondering what happened. I looked at my watch and the time was 217pm.

I got home and about 5:30 pm I was resting against my boat cause I was feeling nausea and a headache.  Also it felt like my food tasted different...I had ate some chips the day after the shot on March 17th and I had told my wife that they tasted different.  Anyway, on  March 20th around 8:30 pm I went to spit and realized I could only spit from the right side of my mouth. I called my daughter, who is an ICU RN, asked me to do a series of tests over facetime with her and she told me I should go in cause when I smiled it wasn&#39;t symmetrical.  She came and picked me up and took me to hospital in.  Immediately there they asked me to smile and to raise my eyebrows and they treated for &#34;possible&#34; stroke.

                                                I woke up the morning of 3/23/2021 approximately 5am with a ringing in my left ear.  It has been constant since that time.  I should add to the other that my blood pressure has elevated since the vaccine.  As part of going on medication on 3/18, it was a concern the medications would elevate my blood pressure.  I bought a wrist BP check device and it was averaging 134/95 on 3/22/2021.  On 3/23/2021, I was prescribed Losartan.  I took one pill at 7:30PM.  Today when I woke up and for most of the day the BP has been 124/77-82.  The ringing remains persistent

My cousin let an attendant know and they sent a Paramedic over to our vehicle.  The Paramedic took my vitals (which I believe were all normal) and gave me a bag in case I needed to vomit.  I started to feel a little better about 20 minutes after the injection and chose to go home and rest rather than go to the hospital.  The 2nd day my arm hurt where to injection was given, I had a headache and was still a bit nauseous although I never did vomit.  I still did not feel 100% on the 3rd and 4th day and better on the 5th day.

                                                One hour after my 2nd vax on April 22, I experienced hearing loss in my right ear. I could only hear muffled sounds. This loss of hearing lasted nearly  24 hours and has appeared to have returned to normal.  After the subsequent loss with my 2nd vax, I realized that I exhibited the identical symptoms, hearing loss in the right ear after my 1st vax on March 25th. On March 28, nearly 3 days later, I exhibited an identical loss of hearing in my right ear. Both events seemed to be triggered by a sudden loud noise. One moment hearing was fine and the next, like a switch was turned on,  the hearing loss came on abruptly.

I went to my doctor and was tested for the flu and covid19 and various other things and everything came back negative. I was given prednisone and about a week later the symptoms went away.

Had ears, nose and throat examined plus a hearing test. Everything came out fine. Doctor put me on a 14-day prednisone treatment. I am supposed to get the 2nd vaccine dose on 5/12. I am seriously considering skipping it until I am done with the prednisone treatment. It has been a horrible experience.

Approximately 1 week after the vaccine, fatigue and weakness returned, along with back pain. Pt reports sleeping 16 hours, awake for 2, sleeping again for 12 hours.  Upon awakening patient reports severe back pain, to which he admits to taking too much tylenol which resulted in upset stomach, but did relieve the back pain.  Symptoms were on a 3-4 days on, 3-4 days off type schedule for approx 3 weeks.  Patient reported complete symptom resolution at time of second injection appointment, but elected not to have the second injection.

About 10-14 days later my shoulder was feeling better but my right wrist started to ache, approx a week later the wrist was feeling better but my right hand finger joints ached for about a week. Now, starting approx 9 May  and 2021 and ongoing, I am experiencing ringing in my ears. The ringing is still present but has subsided. I attribute all these problems as side effects from the covid vaccine.

                                                I acquired Covid on January 13. I was sick for three days, largely with headaches. I lost my sense of smell. After approximately 7 weeks, I had recovered most of my sense of smell. I received dose 1 of Moderna on March 2. Four days later I noticed that my sense of smell had diminished substantially. I contacted my primary and was assured that it wasn&#39;t a result of the vaccine. I saw an EENT, and he too assured me it wasn&#39;t because of the vaccine. I was put on Flonase and one course of steroids (12 days). After 2 weeks, my sense of smell was returning. I received my second dose on 3/30. Within 12 hours I knew something was wrong. My sense of smell seemed to be obliterated. It felt like there was a &#34;hole&#34; in the center of my nose. Within 36 hours, the turbinates in my nose were hypertrophic. I have never suffered seasonal allergies and had never even heard the word &#34;turbinate&#34; before this. 45 days later, my left nostril is blocked. My right nostril is nearly blocked. I have fluid behind both ears, and my hearing has diminshed.  I feel completely let down by the medical establishment and even the CDC. There is no way that I should have been advised to have the vaccine just 40 days after contracting covid. All of the promises that the vaccine can&#39;t reduce sense of smell because there&#39;s no Covid in the vaccine are misleading. My immune system responded to the vaccine by attacking the site of the original infection, which was my nose. This has been devastating to me. I am depressed, anxious, and hopeless that this will correct itself. I will likely suffer some percentage of hearing loss. I was completely recovered from Covid, and it&#39;s only these vaccines that have ruined my health.

                                                Woke up to bloody nose. Stopped by blowing nose (blood plus heavy, dark red mucus), pinching nose, and leaning forward.  Issue built up/recurred every 2 to 3 hours throughout the day. Also, had sinus pressure on left side and maybe post nasal drip (felt it and had the vague taste of iron in my mouth). Issue resolved itself overnight. After clearing my nose  in the morning on 04/26, I was good.  Also, I had a sore arm around the injection site, starting about 6 hours or so after injection, lasting about 2 days

                                                Patient received his vaccine at 3:00PM. At 3:24PM he reported a metallic taste and dry mouth. I then gave the patient 50mg of oral diphenhydramine and he took that along with 16 oz of water. He also stated that he &#34;felt like&#34; his blood pressure was elevated, but that he was anxious about getting a shot so it was probably that. 25 minutes after the diphenhydramine was administered the patient stated that the metallic taste was gone, his mouth wasn&#39;t dry, and his BP was normal. I observed the patient for a total of 60 minutes and he felt normal and wanted to go home.

                                                About three weeks after second shot, 05/18/2021, my hearing in both ears has become stuffy and muted, like when you have a head cold. I did not note the exact time a day because I thought it would just clear up. My stuffy hearing has been constant since roughly 05/18/2021. Also, I have had a constant bloated upset stomach during roughly that same timeframe. Again, thinking it would go away but has not.

On the 24th started around blood sugar spiked to rook on empty stomach, used bathroom constantly, right side of tongue was numb, and continued to run into bathroom, one time noticed facial drooping, weakness right side. Called supervisor to take to ER works as Paramedic, was in brady cardia normally does not have heart problems nor ever had brady cardia. Admitted to hospital, was on prednisone and benzos, for a few days. Was in contact with neuro and endocrinologist.  I was very angry with this happened I tried calling Mederna, Mederna read him the info about not being able to sue them. He waited three months before Mederna asked for records, CDC did nothing. Very angry about the fact that nothing was set up to help people with severe reactions to the vaccines. No one wanted to listen to him. Endocrinologist said this is not normal and they continued to push forward and it was proven that it was attributed to the vaccine.  Nerve damage underneath the right eye from the Bells Palsy. Completed paperwork back in

                                                Ringing in ears, Tinnitus, noticed approximately 1 week after vaccination.  Has not subsided after first noticed.  Upon receiving 2nd vaccination, within 6 hours Tinnitus was worse (louder), and has remained constant as a high frequency pitch.  From time to time have ears feeling blocked.  Went to ENT, Audiologist.  Hearing is perfect, with a slight decrease most likely at the same frequency of the Tinnitus. Tinnitus is definitely worse after 2nd vaccine.  Most likely will reconsider any potential future boosters..as adverse reaction, I cant take a chance for it to worsen, as in sound getting louder.

Mostly recovered or anyway not worried about lingering symptoms at 20 hours past shot (if something gets worse I&#39;ll report again). My goal in submitting this report was only to describe  what I consider to be note-worthy side effects. By comparison, I had a first covid  vaccine dose exactly 1 month ago and no real signs. Also, I had covid-19 infection, moderately sick, in March 2020 (tested pos for covid antibodies in May 2020.

                                                I got the shot at 3pm. I started feeling &#34;off&#34; in stomach/chest around 7-8pm. By 3am, my stomach/chest did not feel good at all and I had trouble sleeping. It was definitely not heart related. By 8am I felt chills coming on. By 9am I was fully dressed, with two blankets on, and lying on couch shaking for 20-30 minutes. Later a fever started and it reached about 102.3 before subsiding late afternoon. By 8pm, I felt blah but fever was gone. During that entire time I felt achy overall (similar to what I felt like 2 hours after running a marathon).  I didn&#39;t have headaches (and rarely do), but area around my eyes were heavy and tired. Weirdly, at times, the top 1/2 of both ears hurt.   I experience about every symptom I had as when I had Covid and went to hospital for 26 days except for the breathing issues.

                                                started with tingling in left neck and up to face.  Talked to the nurse and she said that this can be a common side effect as the powder mixed with the liquid is cold.  If i have more troubles let her know.    After my 35 minutes I left wondering if my lips feeling funny.  i drove 12 miles to my school and went straight to the nurse as my lips were swelling up.  My throat and tongue ok.  I took Benadryl and then hubby picked me up and we went straight to ER.  On the way to hospital my tongue started to feel thick on the left side as we were only blocks away.   Immediately they took great care of me!  They gave my Epi pen shot, steriod and more Benadryl.   I left 3 hours later.  Came home and taking Benadryl as still slight numbness on left lip.   Throat and Tongue great.

                                                about 12 hours after receiving injection began getting aches in arm, head and body. Aches became very strong overnight. Headache was very strong and the type that caused ringing in ears. Overnight got strong chills and fever. These side effects lasted approximately 12 hours. Knowing they were side effects from the vaccine kept me from going to the doctor. These side effects were eerily similar to symptoms I had when I was ill out of the country in Spring 2019. The strong aches, chills and fever were identical. With the very low COVID cases in that country currently, it makes me think that I potentially had a similar coronavirus in 2019, and potentially that is why cases are low in those countries now since the virus may have already done its damage in those countries.

                                                Sweating at first, then chills, nausea (no vomiting but close), dizziness, weakness, close to passing out, hearing change. This all happened within 5-10 minutes. The arm started to feel sore then all of the above happened about 15 min. after the arm starting to hurt. After running water over my face and back of neck, I sat down. The side effects slowly went away.  The entire incident took about 15-20 minutes. This was also about 4 hours after the first vaccine.

He then developed a rapid heart beat with shortness of breath. He then developed a lump in his throat with a throat closing sensation with worsening of shortness of breath.  He elected to stay home without seeking medical attention. The shortness of breath attenuated over the next few hours but rapid heart rate continued for two more days

                                                I developed tinnitus in both ears about a day after getting the first COVID19 Moderna shot. It&#39;s steady and very high pitched and loud enough that I can&#39;t overcome it with fans running at night. It&#39;s been 11 days since the shot and has not changed. The only other side affect I had was a slight headache about an hour after the shot. Overall hearing does not seem to be affected, other than having to hear things over the ringing.

                                                I suffer from tinnitus (ear ringing) originally caused (as best as I can tell) from Aleve and Advil.  It was made worse a few years ago by taking Viagra.  The volume of ringing went up a small amount shortly after taking the medicine, although I attributed that to stress.  However, at roughly the 3-week mark the volume increased dramatically and included pressure in the ear canal.  Imagine the pressure when sitting in an aircraft at takeoff.  The pressure varied over the next day or so but the volume remained at the same high level.  I saw the nurse-practitioner at the doctor&#39;s office 2 days later.  He suspects allergies and is not terribly concerned but said I should see the ENT.  I have an appointment with her in early June.    Every other time the volume has tweaked up like this for more than a few hours it has been permanent.  The last time I went for a full hearing test with the ENT (2015) I was told this is a symptom of hearing damage and there is nothing they can do for me.   I am very afraid to take the 2nd shot - the sound is almost at the level of pain.  I&#39;m not sure I can cope with it being much louder, it has gone from being annoying and bothersome to intrusive.  I have canceled my shot #2 appointment for 4/08/21.

Since approximately the day after my vaccine, my right ear tinnitus has been the worse in, well, about 18 years I think.  It has been constantly &#34;severe&#34; since about a day after the vaccine.

                                                Since my vaccination, I&#39;ve been experiencing itchiness all over my body. The most troubling adverse reactions have appeared in the last two days, five days after receiving the vaccination. Those reactions include the following: vertigo, general feeling of unsteadiness, nausea, visual focusing issues, mental focusing issues, and weakness that is mainly in my arms and legs.

Blood pressure was elevated at 142/102. Patient states he drank a lot of water and after approximately an hour and a half of being at the clinic he felt well enough to go home. In the 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, he felt very achy, specifically in the bottoms of his feet. He felt so achy that he could barely walk. He also experienced a fever and did not take anything to help with these side effects because he reports Tylenol does not work for him very well. All adverse effects were gone by 2-3am on 3/14/2021.

He was taken to a room to lie down and he reports blood pressure was elevated at 152/110. He was given Benadryl and after approximately 45 minutes his blood pressure went back to normal and patient was feeling well enough to go home. Over the course of 24 hours after the vaccine he felt very achey and at one point had a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, which lasted about 4-6 hours. Patient said he took Tylenol to help with these adverse effects but it did not help very much.  Around the injection site he had a bump the size of a ping pong ball and it was red and warm, but the bump completely went away by the fourth day after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Besides pain at the injection site for about 4 days and chills on the third day after the shot, on the second day after my shot, my throat, tongue and lower part of my chin started to hurt fairly severely.   From my research, this did not seem like a typical side effect.    I had trouble sleeping, eating and swallowing without pain.  This is now 8 days after my shot and I still have pain.  I have taken motrin and this has helped, but only some.  As of today, my pain is not as bad as it had developed over the past week.  I reported this to my healthcare provider via a call first and all their only recommendation was to take motrin and not come in for a visit / investigation for 2 weeks which I did not agree with at all based on the severity.  These symptoms that I am reporting do not seem common and based on the severity I really question if i plan to take the second dose.  I really felt that this needed to be reported

After the third day and onward, pressure onsets when I stand or while walking.  Pressure increases until dizzyness sets in, hearing diminishes, followed by pain in front of head. 2.  Pain and pressure in neck and down spine. 3.  Occasional sharp pain in head, as if a blood vessel is about to pop. 4.  After two 1/2 weeks, developed constant sensation of having a migraine headache. Visited doctor April 15th.   Prescribed Methylprednisolone, 4 mg.  Pain and pressure down spine reduced, but did not help other symptoms.   Visited doctor again April 27th.  Doctor gave me medication for Migraine headaches.  It is not helping so far. Doctor ordered MRI scan.   Appointment will be April 30, 2021

After about 15 min I felt light headed and had a ringing in my ears, both symptoms went away after about 15 - 20 min. I received my second dose on 04/21/2021, with no immediate side effects, or any noted side effects the rest of the day. The next morning I experienced fatigue and chills (no fever), and a ringing in my ears, I also had a metallic taste in my mouth. Two days after the second dose I felt a little fatigued, no chills, no metal taste, however the ringing in the ears was still present. The ringing in the ears was almost gone by the third day, however yesterday is became more intense and the metallic taste came back. The ringing subsided after about 20 - 30 mins but was still present and the metallic taste went away. As of this morning I still have a ringing in my ears and the metallic taste came back.  I have read online that all of these symptoms have been noted after receiving Covid vaccines. I don&#39;t feel particularly congested, aside from some stuffiness from being outdoors and mowing the lawn, etc. however in the past I have experienced a metallic taste accompanied with a sinus infection/allergies to fir tree pollen. However none of these symptoms were present prior to my second Moderna dose. I&#39;m concerned about the ringing in my ears, it&#39;s very irritating and my concern is that it is still present fifteen days after I received my second Moderna dose.

                                                About 2.5 weeks after receiving the first injection, I experienced persistent high and mid range frequency hum in ears.  I informed Health Center and indicated that I did not want the second injection for fear that the problem would get worse.  Over time, the amplitude of the humming decreased, so I decided to get the second dose.  24 hours later (now) and the amplitude of the humming has considerable increased. I have never experienced tinnitus before receiving this vaccine.

This started 40 minutes after the first vaccine, peaked within two days and has been constant for over two months now, though the eye problems have been within the last week and are getting worse. It feels like a bad hangover mixed with a low grade ?flu that has been constant and shows no sign of diminishing. PLEASE help me, I?m not sure how much more I can take of this

I went to eye doctor the same day and the doc thought retina looked good. The eye doc sent me home. On February 25 the I received second Moderna vaccine shot. Two days later, February 27th, I began having difficulty with my vision. On that same day I went to the eye doctor who indicated I had a spontaneous detached retina. Emergency eye surgery was performed on the following Monday, March 1st. Doctors do not know what caused my detached retina (right eye).

                                                About 12 hours after getting the second Moderna dose, while trying to sleep, my heart rate was 100-110, with the feeling of repeated PVCs in my heart.  I knew this feeling because I had dealt with episodes of repeated PVCs (and later PACs) from about 2016 to February 2020.  After being in the hospital in February 2020 for life-threatening sepsis, pneumonia, and strep, the arrhythmias stopped completely.  I had been trying to control the episodes by taking atenolol 25mg/d; upon realizing that the PVC episodes had stopped, I terminated the medication.  So at about 1AM on 3/7/2021 or so, I noticed the PVCs and the rapid heart rate and could not sleep.  Fever went up to 102.4, thirsty and possibly dehydrated. Went to ER at 7am.  Tests showed repeated PVCs.  Kidney function was slightly abnormal.  Started taking atenolol through Tuesday, 3/9.  Heart monitor halter showed PVCs continued through Tuesday.  By Thursday, 3/11, it was apparent that the PVCs had stopped and heart rate was normal.  I stopped the atenolol and the irregular heartbeat has not returned.

                                                April 8 about 12 pm, swelling and extreme soreness at injection site. About 5 pm, both ears stopped up. About midnight, chills, muscle and joint aches and headache, Took ibuprofen morning of April 9. Relieved headache and upper arm soreness soon after, but stopped up ears continued. Sometime later, noticed ears were okay. Felt perfect for a few hours after that. About 1-2 pm noticed pulsating sound in right ear. April 10, pulsating and other sounds continued in right ear. Received phone call around 1 pm and discovered that I could only here buzzing sounds instead of words in my right ear. April 11, I saw a general practitioner and received a hearing test. Based on results of hearing test and description of recent events, he sent me to an ENT.

                                                Woke up Sunday morning with extremely swollen lip. Made virtual doctors appointment with picture of lip.  They said get to ER immediately bc i was having an allergic reaction to my blood pressure medicine Lisinopril even though i have been on it for almost 20 years.   When i got to unspecified Hospital they started me on an IV but the swelling would not go down.  They said they had to admit me for the night to continue  steroid treatments.   The doctors were not sure if  it was related to the Moderna shot i had 8 days prior.  I went to my primary care doctor who put me on a different BP med but was very sure it was from the shot.  After one day at unspecified hospital all the swelling was down and i was released .

                                                i have had Tinnitus for approx. 45 years. I am able to manage it via diet, exercise and masking sounds during sleep. Approximately 2 weeks after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine I noticed an marked change in the intensity and frequency distribution of my Tinnitus. It became gradually worse over the next few days. This disrupted my sleep and resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 07-APR-2021. I was prescribed a sleep aid (Eszopiclone 3 mg, 10-day supply) and OTC Melatonin 10 mg by the attending ER physician. Sent home after a hour or so in ER. On 14-APR-2021 discussed issue with a nurse prac. at my  clinic. She extended the Eszoplicone prescription.

                                                On Monday night I tossed and turned, and I gradually realized I felt quite ill. By Tuesday morning I had what I understand to be typical reactions to the second dose: soreness at the injection site, fatigue, muscle aches, chills, overheating, loss of taste, and a touch of nausea. My head was swimming, and putting my hands to my forehead made my head feel a bit better. By midday Wednesday I was gradually improving. But Wednesday evening, at my desk, I noticed my vision seemed blurry. On Thursday morning, I verified that my reading vision (with glasses) was (and is) markedly worse. Now I cannot easily read from my smart phone or computer screen. I plan to see an optometrist as soon as possible.

                                                Severe tinnitus beginning 18 hours after the 2nd vaccine. The tinnitus has not subsided very much as of the date of this report. About 18 hours after the second shot I started getting a very severe headache. The absolute worst of my life and debilitating. I did not have a high fever, but had some chills and fatigue. No nausea. I expected the ringing to return to my &#34;normal&#34; levels pre-vaccine, which is a level that is not usually noticeable unless I focus on it. Now my ears are ringing loudly and the sound is ever present. I am worried this will be a chronic condition.

                                                I have occasionally had sporadic episodes of very mild tinnitus.  About one week after my first vaccine I noticed that my ears began to ring much louder than ever before.  Since that time, the ringing has continued and very gradually increased over the past 7 weeks.  The ringing seems to be getting louder and is constant.  I haven&#39;t yet seen a doctor about this and since tinnitus isn&#39;t &#34;curable,&#34; I am not sure that I will unless this keeps getting worse.

Interview revealed no adverse reaction to first dose on 4-14-21 other than expected sore arm. Pt received 0.5ml dose at approximately 1:15pm while seated in the driver&#39;s seat. .  Within a 2-3 minute time frame after his vaccine the wife alerted me that her husband was not doing well. She stated his eyes were rolling back in his head and he was having a seizure.  911 was called. She stated that patient was unconscious for 20-30-seconds but that he revived and was able to resume basic communications. Shortly thereafter the patient began vomiting repeatedly. The patient&#39;s seat was leaned forward and to the outside of the vehicle to prevent aspiration. EMT teams arrived quickly to take over patient care. patient was transported to emergency department.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA For the first days following my 2nd shot my side effects where pretty standard.  I tinfoil taste in my mouth after the shot, I had numbness in my left arm during the first night, I felt light headed on the 13th and had a fever over 100 F that evening.  The 14th I was just sort of &#34;floaty&#34; and unfocused. I was fine while sitting, but if on my feet for more than a few minutes I got light headed and had to sit down.  By Saturday the 15th I was pretty much back to normal and felt normal on Sunday the 16th.  I went to work on Monday the 17th and worked a full shift from 5:00AM to 4:00PM without any noticeable side effects (maybe a bit higher fatigue than normal). On Tuesday the 18th everything went to (Bleep)  I had a normal start  arriving at work at 6:00AM and felt fine until about 7:30AM when I noticed that the panel I  had just taken out of my machine looked bent.  I grabbed a straight piece of wood to check it and it was straight.  I then noticed that the line of holes also seemed to bend, that shouldn&#39;t happen.  I raised my head and looked around a bit and noticed that everything looked a bit bent, sort of like looking through a fish-eye lens.  It was a mild bending, but there.  I took off my safety glasses thinking maybe they had gotten warped somehow, but it didn&#39;t change anything.  Shortly after this I started feeling dizzy and unsteady on my feet.  I reported this to my supervisor who told me to sit down and make sure to drink some fluids and rest during my 8:00AMbreak.  I took a granola snack bar during break and drank half of my thermos of water.  I sat for a good 10 minutes and started feeling better.  I walked rather unsteadily back to my station and finished the job I was running at the tool, sitting down after starting each piece and then standing up to pull it off when it was done cycling.  I got the job finished but still felt light headed and slightly dizzy.  My supervisor told me to go home and I clocked out just before 9:00AM  I went out to my car and rested for a few minutes then went over to the cafeteria to pick up my lunch and rested some more, then went back to the car.  I waited awhile to see if I still felt dizzy and then left at about 9:30.  The drive home is only 5 minutes, so I felt confident I would be OK as long as I took it slow and kept my vision fixed on the road directly in front of the car.  I arrived at home and checked over my Covid-19 EUA and decided to call my vaccination/healthcare provider.  They scheduled me to come in at 1:15PM and see the PA.  I had a light lunch at 11:15AM and then took a nap until 12:30PM.  My son drove me to my appointment, I was fine walking out to the car, and I didn&#39;t have any nausea or dizziness while in the car.  When I was first led in the assistant took my weight, pulse, and BP.  Surprise my blood pressure was 164/110!  I&#39;ve had slightly high blood pressure before, that is why I am on Lisinopril, but it is very mild, this surprised me!  It apparently surprised the assistant as well since she took my BP again to be sure, and got the same result.  I then stayed seated and waited for the doctor.  She showed up a few minutes later and checked my blood pressure again.  This time it was normal.  Weird.   She checked my eye tracking and heart rate and looked in my ears.  General consensus is that it is high blood pressure and possibly inner ear.  Most likely related to my covid-19 vaccine.  She gave me a blood pressure monitoring sheet and told me to go home, rest, and drink lots of fluids. She sent a prescription for some nausea medication to my pharmacy (I haven&#39;t been to the pharmacy yet to pick it up). She will call me back to check up on me on Thursday after 4:00PM.  In the meantime, I am to check my BP three times a day and anytime I am having an episode, and write it down on the form she gave me.  I have a BP cuff at home, so no problems doing just that.  I wrote about my symptoms on my Facebook page and got a reply from my daughter that said she had blurred vision issues after her second shot that lasted for almost the whole week.  It may be something genetic.  My son had his second shot on the 16th at 12:45PM.  So far, other than a sore arm, he has shown no side effects at all.  He had the Pfizer vaccine, while I had Moderna.  It may have made a difference.  I am just glad he is doing well.

                                                After receiving his second Moderna Vaccine the patient developed severe muscle cramps, metallic taste, agitation/loss of sleep, and stomach upset. He noticed an increase in stooling after eating, however stools were solid. The muscle cramps and mood changes mostly subsided after 7 days, however on day 8 (5/27/21) he was still experiencing taste changes, gi upset, and was having difficulty sleeping. I guided the patient on some symptom relieve and instructed him to contact the pharmacy or his doctor if the symptoms worsened or did not resolve within another 7 days. He felt he was on his way to the symptoms improving and would report any changes.

                                                After receiving 2nd Vaccine, next morning I had very swollen and a painful knot at injection site, flu like symptoms as provider told me might occur, then on March 1, 2020, I starting having severe symptoms in which I was unable to go to work.  I had A SEVERE migraine level 10 pain, severe joint pain all over body level 10 pain, dizziness, eyes burning, blurred vision, chills, extremely fatigued.  Called PCP for doctor appointment. Went for doctor visit and told him all my symptoms, He was very concerned I had a reaction to vaccine.   He prescribed prednisone 7 day pack for severe joint pain &amp; inflammation, Nurtec disintegrating tablets, meloxicam, ordered bloodwork and had follow up in 2 weeks, after two weeks symptoms were still the same very severe, he referred me to Neurologist for evaluation, she ordered MRI as a stat to be done right away,  and started me on meds for Severe Migraines and sent me to Ophthalmologist, she had a nurse get me an appointment the next day.   I saw Ophthalmologist the very next day he did workup and diagnostic testing in his office and stated I had severe swelling and inflammation in the optic nerves in both eyes, and referred me and sent records to Dr., Neuro Ophthalmologist and contacted their office to get me in right away.  I had my appointment with Dr. and she has ordered an ultrasound of my eyes by retina specialist which appointment is in June.  I have follow up with her after ultrasound is done.  Due to severe joint pain I am still having my PCP has referred me to a rheumatologist.  My pain is severe.  The vaccine has attacked my immune system.  Doctors and specialists are doing everything possible and I am still off work.  My return to work date has not been determined.

I have had tinnitus at varying levels since I ruptured my ear drum at age 12.  A few days after the second dose (18-Apr-2021), I developed tinnitus in my right ear. No change to the tinnitus level in my left ear. I have never had tinnitus in my right ear. The tinnitus level in my right ear is about a third of the level of my left ear. It has been 2 months since I received the second dose and the tinnitus levels have not reduced.

                                                About 2 minutes after receiving vaccine the individual reported feeling light headed.  He also described an uncomfortable tingling sensation in his throat.  Blood pressure had been normal prior to vaccination and became elevated.  After about 30 minutes of persistent reaction, one dose of epi-pen (generic) was given.  About 3 minutes after receiving the epinephrine he felt safe to stand up and more to a more comfortable chair.  Lightheadedness, throat sensation, and elevated blood pressure resolved.  He stayed another 15 minutes for observation and has no return of symptoms.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

                                                &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34;  Injection day Saturday March 13th no problems at all, everything was good all day.  I woke up on Sunday morning 8am March 14th with a pretty moderate headache. I didn&#39;t feel good all day and took several naps unable to lose my headache. About 3pm March 14th I had a slight pain in my left eye and developed &#34;floaters&#34;, a lot of them. I decided to take a nap and woke up 1 hour later with less floaters but I had like marble streaks in my left eye vision and about 10 minutes of flashing lights in my left corner eye, not severe though.  My eye looks normal looking in the mirror, nothing looks unusual.  Tonight the same day March 14th, 11pm before bedtime less floaters, I can only see one. The marble streak in my vision appears to be a black streak now when I look down at a white counter top.  I can make it move from left to right when looking at the counter top but I do not have any pain.  I am not sure what to do but I just wanted to let someone know that I encountered a side effect from the vaccine or it could be a coincidence, I have never had this problem before though.

                                                After his injection, the patient was in the waiting area and described a new taste in his mouth. He described it as a &#34;medicine&#34; taste. He said it wasn&#39;t there until he received the vaccine. I examined his arm for redness, swelling, signs of a reaction. There was none. I also screened him for symptoms of anaphylaxis and he had none. I checked on him several times and before he left, he said the taste was &#34;better&#34; and said he had no other symptoms.

                                                Approx a week after I got second (final) vaccine my left eye began twitching. I paid no attention to it. On March 5th I woke up with double vision. It went away within an hour and I worked a full 8 hour day. By the time I got home it was full blown double vision. I attended urgent care who diagnosed me &#34;Cranial Nerve 4 palsy.&#34; I was recommended to see an opthomologist who confirmed this. I wasn&#39;t comfortable with this and asked to see a neurologist who also said cranial nerve 4 palsy. I asked for a brain MRI as I felt something more was going on. The MRI shown no abnormal findings (done 3/11/2021). On 3/16/2021 I woke up with a drooping eyelid of left eye. I immediately called opthomologist who suggested a diagnosis of Myesthenia Gravis. This was confirmed by neurologist on 3/23/2021. I am now on Prednisone and Mestinon. My next plan is to see a MG Specialist at A referral has been sent to them by my neurologist.

I have NOT been diagnosed with COVID and have not contracted it as far as I know.  I only wanted to report that my tinnitus seems have to gotten significantly worse since I got my first dose of vaccine.  It&#39;s loud all the time, even with background noise.

Loss of appetite, Sensitive to bright light, Pain behind eyes, I felt dizzy &amp; felt  like I had the flu. Over a 3 day period, it subsided. On the 4th of April I was still dizzy/ lightheaded/ Had vertigo? As of today, 4/16/21 after seeing my GP, I still have this problem along with a very sore stiff neck. The shot and this problem may be unrelated, but it started during the worst of the side effects.

Thank goodness for flannel PJs and wool socks.  ? I can hear my pulse.  ? I have a headache, also, it&#39;s only about three on the ten-point scale, but it throbs, too.  ? It&#39;s like the fitness work that I&#39;ve done since June last year evaporated. The throbbing is like I did a week of hand drumming. (No, I haven&#39;t.) I can&#39;t close my hands without pain.  ? Every current and past injury is throbbing worse, but the whole body is throbbing.  ? The pain killers that I am able to take aren&#39;t even touching it.

                                                He presented to the ER via ambulance after he had 3 witnessed seizures which included full loss of consciousness and rhythmic jerking lasting for an unknown duration.  En route apparently he was seizing and prehospital personnel gave him 5 mg IM versed as well as 5mg iv versed which did seem to abate the seizure.  He was apparently quite combative and has no prior history of seizures.  In the ER the patient was apparently having right sided eye deviation and was given 2mg of Ativan.  A stat CT of the head did not reveal any acute process.  Telemetry neurology was consulted.  During his work up the patient was found to have a urine toxicology positive for amphetamines as well as opiates.  Telemetry neurology recommended loading the patient with Keppra, initiating regular Keppra doses and indicated they believed the etiology of his seizures was polysubstance abuse.

The 2nd Shot I had a fever after 24 hours and the ringing noises increased, which prompted me to seek medical help.  I had no quick access to a doctor so I pursued online help, where he prescribed the PREDNISONE 20 MG TAB.  A steroid.  It&#39;s still the same, no change.

                                                Not sure if above lot number is correct, their handwriting was messy.  But I experienced a 10 fold increase in my Tinnitus.  My Tinnitus before the shot was very mild and most time un-noticeable.  I thought it would decrease over time but did not.  I had to find an ENT doctor and make an appointment.  I scheduled an appointment and they requested a hearing test before seeing me on 04/20.  My hearing test seems to indicate progression  in my Tinnitus but I can&#39;t confirm it because I didn&#39;t get a record of my previous hearing test back around 2015.  Saw the doctor and he prescribed Prednisone 20 mg  for 7 days.  I finished the treatment and it seemed to help but did not completely get me back to where I was before the Covid 19 Vaccine shot.   Still have noticeable constant ringing in the ears although know at a lower level than initially.   I will be going in for my 2nd dose of the Moderna Vaccine on 4/30/21 per the advice of my ENT doctor and will have a follow up hearing test and doctor visit the week after the shot.  I will report back if 2nd shot causes additional problems

                                                Two days after getting the shot, my existing tinnitus increased dramatically.  I thought the tinnitus blocker in my hearing aids had failed because they were so effective, prior to the shot.  They were checked out as okay, so I think the shot caused the increase.

                                                My husband was sleeping the night of getting his 2nd Moderna Vaccination...  He, during his sleep, had a SEVERE Grand Mal Seizure with NOTHING leading up to it and NO PREVIOUS HISTORY WHATSOEVER of having ANY Seizures in his lifetime, nor ANY Epilepsy...  EVER! It was TERRIFYING, to me - I ran to his bedside (I happened to be in the livingroom watching television) after hearing loud grunts and a crash and came to find him convulsing, severely spewing blood and frothing at the mouth.  Grunting, convulsing, and thrashing.  Stiffening, arms and hands (both in a fist) tight and stiff in front of his chest, legs straight, rigid as a board and thrashing about spitting blood, eyes rolled back in his head.  As things began to becoming a little less severe, while waiting for the Fire Dept &amp; EMTs to arrive I felt his legs which were hit to the touch and his face was drenched in sweat! With NEVER EXPERIENCING Anything like this before, and after 30 years of marriage, I thought my husband was dying ???????? He did NOT go with the EMTs, since once he was awake and somewhat cognitive we realized he was over it for the moment and we&#39;re in a wait and see basis. He saw our GP first thing the next morning.

                                                Same day as 1st vaccine shot I started getting nauseous after dinner. The next morning I woke up with dizziness, nausea, and muffled hearing in my left ear. The 2nd morning after the vaccine shot my left ear was almost completely muffled and the sounds I did hear were frequency distorted to the point I could not understand verbal speech from that ear. During the course of that day my right ear started getting muffled also. The night between the 2nd and 3rd day after the vaccine shot I woke up around 2 am with a severe case of vertigo while laying flat on my back in bed. I immediately felt hot all over and my entire body started sweating. I attempted to do an Epley maneuver with partial success. I eventually got up and took a Zertec-D and tried a second Epley maneuver on the floor in the living room. I was not able to go back to sleep and I made it through the day and the next night by taking another Zertec-D before bedtime.  The 4th day after the vaccine shot I did not take any medications and just stayed in bed or in a recliner all day. The night between the 4th and 5th day after the shot I again woke up around 3am with the worst vertigo ever and by 6am I told my wife I needed to go to the hospital. During the whole time the dizziness and nausea never abated. I was checked into Hospital on the morning of the 5th day after taking the vaccine shot and was transported to  in  for an MRI.

On the second day, my blood pressure was 190 over 110 and still sick with flu like symptoms.  Got the blood pressure to come down by doubling up on high blood pressure meds.  Remained sick for 13 days.  During this time, was working full time (Office duties) and off hours working extreme hours to physical exhaustion on family farm.  On the 13th day, suffered severe seizures that broke my collarbone and shoulder to the point my shoulder needs to be replaced.  The broken bones were not from the fall when I passed out, as my brother caught me and took me to the ground.  No medical history of seizures with me or my family.  Right before the seizure I could only describe myself as feeling off, like I was in a slight fog and not clear of thought or sight.  My brother told me I had about 10 mini seizures while standing and holding on the tailgate of the truck and then one big one that knocked me out for about 15 minutes dislocating and breaking my should and collarbone.

I couldn&#39;t focus clearly at all. My family recommended that I go to the ER. I decided to see my optometrist because they know my eyes very well. They checked the pressure of my optic nerve. They didn&#39;t see anything there that would need to be treated by an ophthalmologist. There was nothing wrong with my eye pressure. They gave me some eyedrops and told me to take it easy for a couple of days. I would have issues on and off and it would normally clear up after I used Visine. As of today, everything is good. I am going for a follow up with my optometrist in a week or two.

I went to the ER and they gave me prednisone treatments and since then it has become a lot better. Arm movement was limited due to the pain as well. I had no other symptoms other than that. Just a week ago it was still swollen and now it is not sore to the touch anymore at least. I do have slight arthritis in that shoulder if that is need to know information.

I had the expected side effects Chills, aches, headache but was not expecting the tinnitus and thought initially it would resolve with the other symptoms but it has not.  It is a constant high pitched tone.  I was not exposed to anything else that day.  No loud noises and have no symptoms other illness.  This is the first time I have experienced this. It doesn&#39;t seem to be in one ear or the other, It is just there , constantly.  I did not go to a doctor because I am one and know nothing can be done.

After 45 minutes the redness abated and I came home,    1 March 2021 I came down with COVID symptoms with dizziness, blurry vision, redness, ringing in the ear and flu like symptoms of body aches.   Then the neuralgia in the dextral ulnar nerve increased and clawing started.  Then same happened on the sinistral ulnar nerve and Carpal tunnel in the other finders.  I feared going to sleep for fear of awaking with paralysis.  I drank vodka to calm myself down and Xanax to sleep (I know it is a dangerous combination).  2 March the red skin continues and when I awoke at 13:30 today I was still extreme and I called 911.  The EMS visited and determined my blood pressure and pulse were normal.  The dextral  ulnar nerve problems continue,

Dissipated after 1 hour; Re-appeared around 6 pm but less irritating. Not present today. (Haven?t had any hives in more than a decade.) Roof of mouth and ear canals became very warm and itchy...like an intensifying of my seasonal allergies. Continued to decrease after 7 pm; also used a cold milkshake to relieve the sensation between 5:15 pm and 6:00 pm. Both sides of my tongue swelled and were itchy.  Symptom subsided around 7 pm. Minimal pain at injection site; no redness No fever, no headache.

Felt very, very out of it and confused. Fell asleep  and felt still confused but not as badly and could talk. Arm and mouth felt tingling / numb. Went to work but left as felt similar symptoms  to mini-stroke 15 years previous. Went to urgent care and then ER. ER stated EKG was abnormal indicating heart attack at some point.

The night of the 14th, he awoke with itching and hives on the left side of his body.  On the 15th, his bottom lip swelled.  On the evening of the 16th, the itching became more intense. Patient has taken benedryl and applied calamine lotion. Both provided temporary relief as symptoms returned later.  Patient is in our county indigent care program and will hopefully get to see a nurse practitioner about his condition.

                                                I received the first Covid-19 vaccination 3/29/21.  A few weeks later my grandkids (who previously had a covid-19 positive illness months prior) came to visit from out of state for a few days.  They were sick with colds.  After they left, I got (presumably) the cold that they had and was sick for about a week.  I postponed my 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine until it had been 10 days of feeling better (although I did have mild headaches that ibuprofen seemed to quell).  After receiving the the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine I began to have severe pain in one or two of my teeth, ear, and eye.  I assumed it was dental related and spoke to my dentist who put me on amoxicillin and scheduled an appointment a week later.  The pain and headaches intensified and I was taking a lot of ibuprofen and acetaminophen (max doses of each) to reduce the pain.  At the time of my dental appointment my symptoms had lessened a bit and the dentist took x-rays that were inconclusive.  She referred me to another dentist specialist who did the same thing and it was also inconclusive which tooth was bothering me or if there was even decay (under 2 crowns).  The second dentist wanted me to come back after NOT taking any pain meds to make a definitive diagnosis.  So, I stopped taking pain meds and the dental pain wasn&#39;t coming back.  What DID come back though were the headaches which now I believed were migraine headaches that were treatable with Fioricet (a migraine med).  Eventually, after maybe 14 days after the 2nd Moderna shot, the headaches finally disappeared...and my teeth are fine.

The bad taste remained into the evening. 7 to 10 hours later I had a fever of 103F and felt very week and tired with body aches.  I rotated Ibuprofen and Tyleonl and my fever ran between 101F and 103F for 24 hours after the fever started the evening after the shot.  The extreme flu like symptoms lasted about 36 hours from onset the evening after the shot.  over the course of 48 hours thereafter the symptoms gradually improved to the point where I felt just fine.  I also experienced minor left arm pain from the injection. My arm was killing me for a week after the 1st injection!

The pharmacy did not have me stay to be observed. They said they weren?t doing that anymore.  This happened as my wife was driving me home and she observed the allergic reaction as well.  The migraine lasted  About 10 hours and the swelling in my face lasted about 24 hours.  I went home and took Tylenol for the migraine and iced got swelling.

Several weeks after, in 03/07/2021 I started to have total loss of hearing in my left ear, and ringing in both ears. I went to the ER. After going to another ear doctor I have 40 % loss of hearing in my left ear and ringing in both. I have acid reflux and I could not eat anything because I would throw up. They did an upper GI and turns out I have a small  hernia and they gave me Pantoprazole. I go back to the stomach doctor this month and to the ear doctor on October. I still have no taste or smell since 11/19/2021.
