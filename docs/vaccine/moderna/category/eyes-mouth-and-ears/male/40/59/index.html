Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

                                                Starting this morning, the left side of my face has gone numb.  There is a charlie horse like feeling in my left cheek, which is now also present in my left jaw. The left side of my tongue is numb with slight pain, and my bottom lip is numb on the left side, and the feeling stops at the middle like there were a line drawn down my face.  My upper left cheek and the side of my left eye have a constant,  moderate burning feeling.  The shot was in my left arm.  The Dr. at urgent care said it was not a stroke, so that&#39;s good.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  It has now been over 13 hours.

                                                The shot was administered in my left arm.  I experienced localized swelling and axillary lymph node tenderness immediately after injection under my left armpit.  The right side of my face also became numb for about 5 minutes.  The next morning the areas around my eyes were swollen and I had two styes in my right eye.  I do not know if these were related.  These symptoms lasted approximately 3 days.  Some minimal swelling and tenderness seemed to remain, and approximately a week later I experienced a painful resurgence of the swelling at the injection site that was far larger, harder and more painful.  I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen.  These relieved the symptoms within 48 hours.

Still experiencing facial paralysis on the right side. It?s unknown if it will be permanent.

He said he felt like his head was being compressed. His lower lip began to feel numb and tingly, eventually this feeling spread into his mouth and throat. He was coherent the entire time. He received oral Benadryl while waiting for his wife to arrive to drive him to the emergency room.

                                                Within minutes of receiving my Moderna Covid-19 vaccine around 5pm, my left eye felt irritated. I didn&#39;t think much of it but it stayed slightly irritated. About 1am, as I prepared for bed, it had become red and was quite irritated. I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night and my eye was quite irritated and it was filled with tears. The next two days it remained irritated in this way, red and painful. As of now (over 48 hours later), it is still red and irritated.

                                                Received first dose of Moderna vaccine on Tuesday 2/23/2021 and began to feel tingling on the right side of my head and an ear ache the next day (Wednesday 2/24/2021). The symptoms got progressively worse over the next few days and on Sunday 2/28/2021 the right side of my face was completely paralyzed. I sought emergency care at Hospital Emergency Room where I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. The doctor who treated me strongly believes that the Bells Palsy was due to the Moderna vaccine. Today (9 days post vaccine) the entire right side of my face continues to be completely paralyzed with no signs of improvement.

Left eye blin is weak and unable to fully close left eye.  Left ear was aggravated and irritated when scratched.  Hearing is distorted, felt as if I had been submerged in water for a prolonged amount of time.  There is ringing at times on left ear as well.  Symptoms were progressive.  Today (05-MAR-2021), also developed vertiginous sensation and light-headedness.

Didn&#39;t think anything of it, Monday my right eye began to water like crazy. Didn&#39;t think anything of it. Tuesday morning I had a hard time eating breakfast because I couldn&#39;t open my mouth wide enough and was hitting my bottom lip with my teeth. i thought it was strange but didn&#39;t think anything of it. Took a shower about 11;30 and when I looked in the mirror I notice the ride side of my face was not responding like the left side, I called my doctors office and they got me right in. After a brief consultation they called ER and told me I would be on my way. I checked into ER at about 1;30pm.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

                                                Within 48 hours of receiving the COVID vaccine, I began having extreme pressure and discomfort in my right ear.  Symptoms included dizziness, fullness in the ear and hearing loss.  This persisted for several days.  As a first course of action, I took Tylenol and antihistamines.   I saw my PCP a few days later and he misdiagnosed my condition and suggested that I continue with antihistamines and Flonase.  Two weeks later my condition had improved only slightly and I became more concerned.  I asked my PCP whether a short course of steroids was warranted (at the suggestion of my mom and wife, who are both health care professionals).  He prescribed a &#34;dose pack,&#34; which I started on or about Monday, Feb. 22.  Later that week, I connected with an ENT  who is a friend of a friend .  When I told him my story and symptoms he was extremely concerned and got me an immediate appointment on Friday, Feb. 26.  At that visit I was diagnosed with acute and severe Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that had resulted in 92% hearing loss in my right ear.   Additional symptoms continue to include fullness, tinnitus and other discomfort.  None of these issues existed prior to my COVID vaccine shot.  I am currently undergoing a treatment of high dose prednisone and steroid injections in my ear.   I am scheduled for another visit with doctor on Friday, March 12.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

                                                Vaccine was administered to patient in his room at 12:50pm.  After the patient finished his lunch in his room he was wheeled out to the nursing station for observation.  at 1:30pm the nurse wheeled patient into our working/set up area and stated that patient is having a vaccine reaction.  I observed that his lips were noticeably swollen.  I asked patient to stick out his tongue, it also was noticeably swollen.  Only the tip of his tongue extended about 1/2 inch past his lips.  I administered 0.3mg of Epinephrine via and epi-pen into his right thigh and instructed the nursing staff to call 911.  Patient improved markedly over the next 10 minutes when Fire Department EMT&#39;s arrived.  Nursing staff monitored his  blood pressure, heart rate and pulse  and oxygen sat.  heart rate was elevated somewhat likely due to epi , BP was 121/73, pulse steady and ox sat good.  Fire Department transported patient to a nearby ER for further evaluation and treatment if necessary.

                                                Loss of vision; Possible lowgrade central retinal occlusion; retinal venous dilation; Decreased vision; Unexplained Retinal Hemorrhages; A spontaneous report was received from an ophthalmologist retinal specialist concerning a 46-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and developed loss of vision, decreased vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion.     The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 23 Dec 2020, approximately four days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20-2A) intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 27 Dec 2020, the patient experienced decreased vision.  On 29 Dec 2020, the physician examined the patient. There was some retinal hemorrhage, venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion. Lab work was requested by the physician and results were pending. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events, loss of vision, decreased vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade central retinal occlusion were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a  46 year old male patient. The patient&#39;s medical history is not provided. The patient experienced a serious, unexpected event of loss of vision, unexplained retinal hemorrhages, retinal venous dilation, and possible low grade  central retinal occlusion. The event occurred 4 days after first dose of the mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information are required for further assessment.

                                                I developed tinnitus in my ears about 3 to 4 hours after vaccine. I normally don&#39;t get this. Rarely after a concert or game but short lived. This has stuck around and I kept waiting for it to disappear. Unfortunately it has not. My right ear is worse than my left but the tinnitus remains so I thought I should report it. I have been looking on-line for any other reports and see none. This may be coincidence but due to lack of resolution of tinnitus, I thought I should report it. My flu-like symptoms (headache, shaking chills, sore arm) disappeared within 36 hours.

Then when I woke up approximately 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt severe sinus pressure, headache, light sensitivity, body aches, slight nausea, continued fever cycling, and lethargy. These symptoms began to resolve 24 hours after they started. These were the exact same symptoms that I experienced when I had Covid-19.

It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

Got epi 0.3 mg IM, Decadron 10 mg IV, Zyrtec 10 mg, Pepcid 40 mg po, Benadryl 25 mg po, with improvement.  Allergy consulted, felt this was likely delayed hypersensitivity reaction to Moderna, but couldn&#39;t exclude lisinopril side effect.  They recommended Zyrtec 10 mg bid for 1 wk, and stay off lisinopril.  Will follow up in Clinic to determine how to approach 2nd shot.

I have a Son that suffers from tinnitus - I would compare the symptoms to those of my son&#39;s tinnitus.  I have had to purchase a white noise machine to assist with sleeping.     This is very alarming - had I known of the outcome I would not have taken the vaccine.  I hope this noise reduces over time.    I would be happy to discuss more if requested.

The patient developed headache, lack of taste, fatigue as well as the aforementioned rash on 1/14/2021(6 days after receiving first dose of covid vaccine.  A rapid covid test was positive on 1/14/2021 also.  The patient was prescribed claritin, methylprednisolone for the rash after seeing his family physician virtually and the family physician recommended he contact where he was vaccinated to report these symptoms.  I have reached out to the patient for additional information and he has declined, so I do not have any access to details on his positive covid test or records from that virtual encounter.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

Hearing loss was accompanied by a loud static sound and pressure. Saw ENT specialist on Tue 3/2 -- no evidence of any wax buildup. She immediately sent me for hearing test; showed 70% loss. Both doctors feel this is a Viral infection and that it may have occurred due to my strong  immune response I had to the COVID vaccine. Was prescribed 60mg of Prednisone for two weeks; am on day 3 as of writing this. Am going to see another specialist tomorrow, 3/5/21. I am a healthy 50yr old male with no previous hearing problems. The only change in my life was getting the vaccine. I think this important to report, although I have yet to find any link between vaccine and SSHL. I have been tested over the last year a few times (mouth swab) and all test were negative. I have not been tested since my hearing loss, though I don&#39;t feel sick at all. I have read that some people who actually had COVID experienced new or increased tinnitus but did not find anyone who had actual hearing loss -- this was just doing some online reading; not actual study reports.

On 13-Apr-2021, the patient experienced CONFUSIONAL STATE (confusion/was not coherent) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VISION BLURRED (blurry vision) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VOMITING (vomited) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CARDIAC OUTPUT INCREASED (cardiac outcomes went up, from the lab results they were elevated) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, CONFUSIONAL STATE (confusion/was not coherent), VISION BLURRED (blurry vision), VOMITING (vomited) and CARDIAC OUTPUT INCREASED (cardiac outcomes went up, from the lab results they were elevated) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient had his first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine yesterday and immediately felt the vaccine go to his chest and down to the toes; 30-40 minutes after had confusion, blurry vision; he made it to a hospital in Dallas where he vomited, he could not read at the moment, could not call 911, did not know how to send his location, how to call or text, he was not coherent.

                                                1.  Woke up the day after receiving the first dose without the ability to taste anything.  I could smell soaps/mint/fragrant lotions etc, if I sniffed it up close, but I could not taste anything. I tested this with several different  types of food.  This lasted until about 12:30 pm that day.  When I ate lunch I could taste my food again.   This was a strange event for me. I have never lost my sense of taste before.  2.  The evening of the third day after receiving the first dose of the moderna COVID-19 vaccine I experienced an approximate 4 inch diameter redness and itching around the injection site on my left shoulder.  There was also an itchy rash that extended across my chest and back to my right shoulder.  I took an antihistamine and went to bed.  When I awoke the next day the rash extending across my chest, back, and right shoulder was gone.  However, my left shoulder still  itched for the rest of that day.  The itchiness was gone when I awoke the next day.

He advised he sat in his car for a while and came back in and took 2 benadryl.  I escorted member down to ACC and handed him off with report. He was in no acute distress, able to talk and ambulate. While checking into ACC he indicated he felt the benadryl was helping and felt a little better. (Initially during the 15 minute observation, member advised his mouth was dry and asked for water, which after drinking he said he was fine and that it helped. He was in no distress at that time. )

                                                Numbness in right side of head and right arm (where he received injection). Starting getting confused. Legs started to give out. Continued working. Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                SYMPTOM 1 - Pronounced persistent vertigo 7 days after Moderna Shot #1.  Very healthy.  Never before experienced vertigo of any significance.  Degree of vertigo strong for entire first day undeniably present/persistent and varies (slightly improved, then worsens again) since day 8. Able to get through day but disturbing. Extremely healthy otherwise,  extremely athletically capable.  Nothing unusual in diet or sleep or activity or stress in recent days.  SYMPTOM 2 - Ringing ears on day 11, and increasing on day 12.  This too - never before of any significance in entire life.  Could it be related to the vertigo symptoms?  Feels like it is.  *** Please take note! *** Hard to dismiss as unrelated.  I&#39;m just one.  You have the sample data.  Seems as though auditory/balance nerves are getting a beating somehow.  This is NOT an exasperated pre-existing condition.  The shoulder soreness / tiredness - was a 1 day matter quickly resolved.  This is more insidious and persistent and debilitating.

Was not immediately noticeable and seemed to be more pronounced about 1/2 hour after injection.  I had the other expected soreness at injection site and general malaise approximately 24 hours after  - 96 hours after vaccine and I am only reporting this as I was not expecting the numbness in the tongue and was not sure if it was an adverse effect or just stress related.

                                                So basically I believe I have Bell&#39;s palsy  .  After about an hour after receiving the vaccine I noticed I was having a weird taste in my mouth. Sort of a metallic taste. As the weekend went on it seemed to get worse. Then Monday morning I noticed when brushing my teeth that I wasn?t able to  gurgle my mouth wash. And saw that my mouth and eye seemed to be drooping slightly. Now Thursday the 21st and it seems to be effecting my speech to were I now have a lisp. Can definitely see it when I?m speaking to someone. Which people have commented on.  Not sure what can be done . But at this point I?m hoping it doesn?t get worse. Thanks

Patient felt as though throat may have been closing so he administered an epi pen to himself. As no immediate relief patient administered a second epi pen which provided relief. Approximately one hour after vaccination patient felt back to normal and chose to leave the clinic with instructions to report to emergency room if symptoms began to return.

                                                Afew hours after receiving the inoculation, I was extremely sleepy.   I was sleeping at my job, and my boss had me go home early.  I went to work the next day, however I was feeling weird, my sense of smell and taste were off, as the day continued I started having a headache, body aches, and general malaise.  I went home early, again from work.  But when I arrived to my residence I was having severe chills despite my efforts to try to keep myself warm.  The chills lasted for more than 24hrs, preventing me from sleeping, my body aches were getting worse, my eyes were extremely red, and I did not feel like eating.  Near the end of the day, the chills became sweats, and I was trying to balance between being hot and clammy, to chills.  The next day I paid a visit to my primary care doctor.  I was tested for covid - which was negative, I was tested for the flu - which was negative, and my lungs were clear so there was no reason for my doctor to believe I have a pneumonia.

On Saturday 1/23/21 I woke up with hives on my left arm and chest and a swelling on my left eye.  I took benadryl which had no effect. The next day the hives had progressed to blisters, my hand swelled  and my eye had almost swollen shut.  I contacted my health care advisers and they prescribed predinosne.  This reversed the reaction and the wounds are healing.  I have pictures of how I looked.

                                                On Saturday, January 30, 2021 I began experiencing an altered sense of taste with a metallic taste all through my mouth and tingling in my mouth.  I mostly felt ill throughout the day with low-grade fever, fatigue, body aches.  This continued on Sunday, January 31, 2021 and Sunday evening, I noticed a small droop in the upper lip on the right side of my mouth.  When I awakened, Monday, February 1, 2021, I had full right-side paralysis of the face, severe right eye, right jaw and right ear pain, severe fatigue, continued body aches.  After going to the ER where tests were performed to rule out stroke and sepsis, I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.

CT scans were inconclusive so I was transferred (9:45 PM 2/25/21), admitted and an MRI scheduled for 24 hours later. MRI (12:00 AM 2/27/21) was negative for stroke. Beginning stages of Bells Palsy was diagnosed. Prescribed Prednisone, Lipitor, Valtrex,  and baby aspirin upon discharge 1:45 PM 2/27/21).  By 2/28/21  symptoms had increased to the point where I can not suck through a straw, speaking is difficult and overall, extreme loss of muscle control in my face and feel like I have a bad head cold.

                                                I have had Tinnitus (Ringing Ears) for several years but it has generally been mild and tolerable. A couple of days after the first dose I noticed my ears were ringing more then usual. It has been very annoying and bothersome. I am very concerned if they will continue ringing this loudly. I am not going to get the 2nd dose. I am very much hoping as the vaccine wears off that my ears will get better.

I ate dinner at approx. 6pm, and had salad, steak and green beans, all of which I have eaten before without any side effects I don&#39;t believe it is a food allergy and I have not experience any trauma to my lips or face.  At approximately 5:30am, I took 2 Benadryl, in an attempt to reduce swelling.  As of 8am, the swelling is still evident.  Other than swollen lips, only other reaction to shot is minor soreness by the injection site in my left arm.  I am not sure if there is a correlation between the vaccine and my swollen lips, but I&#39;ve never had swollen lips before. Only other reason, for the swelling,  I could think of would by possible spider bite but I feel that is unlikely. If swelling persists, I will contact my doctor.

                                                I suffer from tinnitus (ear ringing) originally caused (as best as I can tell) from Aleve and Advil.  It was made worse a few years ago by taking Viagra.  The volume of ringing went up a small amount shortly after taking the medicine, although I attributed that to stress.  However, at roughly the 3-week mark the volume increased dramatically and included pressure in the ear canal.  Imagine the pressure when sitting in an aircraft at takeoff.  The pressure varied over the next day or so but the volume remained at the same high level.  I saw the nurse-practitioner at the doctor&#39;s office 2 days later.  He suspects allergies and is not terribly concerned but said I should see the ENT.  I have an appointment with her in early June.    Every other time the volume has tweaked up like this for more than a few hours it has been permanent.  The last time I went for a full hearing test with the ENT (2015) I was told this is a symptom of hearing damage and there is nothing they can do for me.   I am very afraid to take the 2nd shot - the sound is almost at the level of pain.  I&#39;m not sure I can cope with it being much louder, it has gone from being annoying and bothersome to intrusive.  I have canceled my shot #2 appointment for 4/08/21.

They said get to ER immediately bc i was having an allergic reaction to my blood pressure medicine Lisinopril even though i have been on it for almost 20 years.   When i got to unspecified Hospital they started me on an IV but the swelling would not go down.  They said they had to admit me for the night to continue  steroid treatments.   The doctors were not sure if  it was related to the Moderna shot i had 8 days prior.  I went to my primary care doctor who put me on a different BP med but was very sure it was from the shot.  After one day at unspecified hospital all the swelling was down and i was released .

                                                About 2 minutes after receiving vaccine the individual reported feeling light headed.  He also described an uncomfortable tingling sensation in his throat.  Blood pressure had been normal prior to vaccination and became elevated.  After about 30 minutes of persistent reaction, one dose of epi-pen (generic) was given.  About 3 minutes after receiving the epinephrine he felt safe to stand up and more to a more comfortable chair.  Lightheadedness, throat sensation, and elevated blood pressure resolved.  He stayed another 15 minutes for observation and has no return of symptoms.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

I sat on the edge of the tub. After a couple of minutes I went to get up and fainted on the floor.  My BP was 89/49 with a pulse of 86bpm. I was helped off the floor and back to bed where I lay with my feet elevated by a couple of pillows. No further issues at this time.

It is a constant high pitched tone.  I was not exposed to anything else that day.  No loud noises and have no symptoms other illness.  This is the first time I have experienced this. It doesn&#39;t seem to be in one ear or the other, It is just there , constantly.  I did not go to a doctor because I am one and know nothing can be done.
