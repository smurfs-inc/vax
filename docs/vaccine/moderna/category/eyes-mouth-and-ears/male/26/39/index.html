                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Vaccine administered 3/11/21 at public health pop-up clinic. Sore arm from night of vaccine through day 5. Beginning on day two, extreme muscle twitching, spasms, and involuntary movements. This lasted until day 8. Starting on day 3, daily persistent cranial pressure, right eye pressure, and ear pressure. This persists today (day 26). On day 4, heart rate noticeable heart rate increases, palpitations, and chest tightness. This persists today (day 26).   On day 7, I woke up early AM and upon trying to fall back asleep, had what felt like 4-5 seizures before finally falling back to sleep. Upon waking up, right side of body was weak, tingling; right eye vision was blurry and right ear was muffled. Decided to go to ER after 2-3 hours of consistent symptoms. Admitted for observation, routine labs completed, normal. Brain CT w/o contrast, unremarkable. Symptoms persisted into next day, brain MRI WWC performed, unremarkable. ER docs and specialists (neurologist/cardiologist) implied that it could be related to vaccine, as no history of any such symptoms or disease and the temporal association with vaccine administer. Was discharged and told to follow up with PCP, neurologist, cardiologist.   Have since been in and out of doctors appointments(PCP, neurologist, cardiologist), labs drawn weekly, and several follow up imaging/labs. No doctor so far can figure out a clinical problem, but several symptoms persist or worsen as time goes on. As of now, right side weakness/tingling considered RESOLVED. Cranial/ear/eye pressure considered UNRESOLVED. Chest tightness, heart rate increases considered UNRESOLVED.

I noticed that if I put in an earbud or there is sufficient noise, I do not notice it but otherwise it is fairly annoying and made it harder to fall asleep. I took a hot shower and it seemed to help but the sound came back not long after.

Loss of vision lasted for 1 minute.  Loss of vision occurred while standing.  Referral to primary care and ophthalmology specialist found normal eye exam and MRI of orbits but  presence of tachycardia especially while standing (fluctuations between 60 beats at rest/laying down to 130 beats per minute standing).   Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)  is suspected.  Currently pursuing cardiac workup with cardiologist and Covid POTS specialist.  POTS specialist believes autoantibody development after vaccination could be suspected as recovering covid patients similarly present to clinic with POTS like symptoms.

I went to walk in clinic and was being treated for pink eye. I was started on an antibiotic eye drop. A day later my right eye started to have the same problem. I scheduled an appt with a eye specialist where he examined both eyes and said I had a major infection. I was started on steroid eye drops which I am still taking but seems my eyes are not getting better. I have a follow up with another specialist next week for further testing. I have been out of work due to this matter.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

                                                After the mandatory 15 minute waiting period in the vaccine waiting area at Hospital, I felt okay and did not feel the need to remain in the waiting area.   After I returned home between an hour and an hour and a half after receiving the first dose of the Moderna Vaccine,  I felt the onset of an anaphylaxis reaction in which my mouth felt dry and my throat began to feel swollen. I used my Epipen and took Benadryl to help the allergic symptoms subside. After this treatment, the symptoms subsided and I did not seek further medical attention as it was unnecessary.  I was in the care of my father who is a physician.

Everything has a similar odor, where good things smell more mediocre, and bad things smell &#34;less bad&#34; if that makes sense. Everything is taking on the same sense and smell, but not 100%. I can still smell peanut butter or a rose and tell what it is, but it is drastically different and can be unpleasant. Food is not as enjoyable and neither are smells. All my foods are taking on the same smell and taste.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

I haven?t been able to sleep since then and my fever has spiked as high as 104.5. I?m also experiencing headache, ear aches, mild sore throat, nausea, and chest tightness/pain during deep breathing. No shortness of breath symptoms though. Aleve and Tylenol do not appear to be helping. I feel worse than when I had Covid back in November.

I started feeling Fever with Chills on 1/15/21 evening and then I had headache, and next day I lost smell and taste. I thought these are all COVID symptoms and went for lab testing for SARS RT PCR testing on 1/18/ 21. The result was Detected. I am now feeling well. I went for another testing again for the same test and waiting for the result. Now my question is I have second dose scheduled at 2/7/2021. What if my second lab result comes Negative and What if my second lab result comes Positive? I want to know if i need to take a shot or not? I was isolated in my room at home for all these days and still isolated until I get my result.

I woke up around the10 am  the 25th.the next day. I had a migraine that wouldn&#39;t go away. I was feeling nauseous and still had a light sensitive headache. I took Migraine medication, and eventually mid afternoon the symptoms went away. Less than 24 hours later I was back to normal. March 4th I was using Gold Bond Ultimate Mens lotion and had an adverse reaction. My hand swelled up, and got red.  I took Benadryl and it went away. March 5th I used Curel lotion and the same thing happened. Did not take Benadryl.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Swelling of the throat occurred between 45 mins and 1 hour after Vaccine. Treated with 1 Benadryl and 1 Claritin near the 45 minute mark. Symptoms improved about 1 hour and 30 minutes after getting the vaccine and were no longer noticeable by 3 PM (approx 3 hours after vaccine). After the throat swelling receded I noticed a little bit of numbness in the tongue and throat for another 1-2 hours (4-5 hours after the vaccine). Swelling of throat was uncomfortable but not severe enough to cause breathing issues. There were also no problems swallowing or speaking.

These symptoms lasted for about 5 hours with varying levels of severity. My temperature high was 98.3 F according to the infrared forehead thermometer I used throughout the duration of symptoms.

Blood test showed that I am suddenly highly allergic to 19 different food groups. I have no known food allergies prior to C19 Moderna Vaccine. I have had hives every single day since they 1st appeared (3.5 days after vaccine). I have had multiple days of facial swelling as well and have been to the hospital multiple times. To this date (date of this report) I still have hives and facial swelling. Facial swelling is intermittent. I have stayed away from the list of foods that I am apparently suddenly allergic to and I still have hives and swelling. I occasionally have a irritated throat which makes it difficult to breathe in. I have a specialist appointment with an allergy/immunology doctor this coming Thursday to see what thier diagnosis is. My family doctor believes my potential angioedema diagnosis is directly related to my 1st dose of C19 Moderna Vaccine.

                                                A few minutes after the vaccine was administered the patient felt hot, lightheaded, dizzy and had to sit down.  While sitting down his eye rolled back and he passed out.  His spouse said his body was shaking.  She lowered him to the floor and he awoke.  Paramedics were called and determined his blood pressure was very low. They tried to stand the patient up to take another blood pressure reading, but the patient had to sit down as he became dizzy and lightheaded again.  The paramedics took him to the ER where the doctor said he was fine and discharged him.

                                                My vision became burry and I was unable to see what I was looking directly at- similar to if I had been looking directly at a bright light source for several seconds- This lasted for approximately 5 minutes. After 5 minutes this went away, but my left-most vision (extreme left of my field of view) began getting blurry and having the kaleidoscope effect- This lasted for approximately 15 minutes, and then subsided. Since these two vision anomalies, I have intermittently had a dull ache in my right hemisphere of my head. This ache will just come in a flash for a second or two, and then won&#39;t happen again for hours.

Similar symptoms to L 5th toe and R great toe. As days progressed it got more diffuse and extended up to mid-calf that was very mild... eventually by day 10 it dissipated, thank god.  To add I also experienced L facial dull pain and the distal portion of my tounge felt like I burnt it (lasted 5 -7 days)

At about 1030AM I had a very bad headache and was extremely nauseous for about 3 hours and felt like vomiting but did not vomit. This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

                                                Developed iritis form of uveitis shortly after getting vaccine. Felt feverish and very fatigued and sore the day after the vaccine (3/19/21), which was unexpected as I am generally healthy and do not recall having an adverse reaction to a vaccine before. Noticed prominent symptoms of iritis by around 2/22/21, but they may have been occurring earlier as I did not know what was happening to me. Symptoms started off as occasional aching of my right eye, but it eventually got inflamed and extra sensitive to light, and I experienced worse redness and aching/pain and photosensitivity by 2/26/21 when I scheduled an appointment with an optometrist. Pain/sensitivity was intermittent from 2/26/21 to  3/1/21, but redness remained. On 3/1/21, my optometrist tentatively diagnosed me with mild iritis and referred me to an opthalmologist. On 3/1/21, an opthalmologist diagnosed me with iritis/anterior uveitis, and I began a treatment of prednisolone acetate 1% drops. thought my development of iritis may have been related to me getting my first dose of the Covid-19 Moderna vaccine shortly before getting symptoms. Hoping to recover within  a few weeks. Have a follow-up appointment scheduled for 3/10/21.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

I began to have sensitivity to spicy foods on Thursday. On Friday I woke up and my words were slurring as my tongue felt more swollen  and I started to notice some slight swelling in my throat, maybe 5%. I started gargling diphenhydramine on Friday night and that helped a lot, I also took loratadine and Fexofenadine. By Sunday my symptoms were masked by the allergy drugs and I stopped taking the diphenhydramine. 1 week later, 12 days post Moderna Vaccinne I stopped taking the fexofenadine and Loratadine. I continued to have tongue irritation and a sore on my tongue for 2.5 weeks. I then had an adverse event after the 2nd shot as well.

                                                I premedicated with Diphenhydramine, fexofenadine and loratadine as suggested by the urgent clinic from my previous adverse event. 10 minutes after the 2nd shot I felt hot flashes in my L glut region, then 15 minutes  in I started to feel tongue swelling and slight throat swelling (maybe 10-20%). I felt this decrease but was still present 25 minutes after the shot, I notified a rep at the nurses tent. They asked some questions and said they could take me into the tent but that if I felt it was improving to just wait 15 more minutes, I did that and left after. I continued to have some tongue swelling the next day and continued taking all 3 antihistamines for maybe 3 days. I previously had sensitivity to spicy foods and my tongue feeling inflamed but not swollen from the previous shot, this again occurred the 2nd time. I maintained this with gradual dissipation of symptoms until about 3/1/21. I believe all my symptoms were resolved at that point.

                                                I recieved the moderna covid vaccine.  I ate a few things that just tasted a little off.  I thought the product may have just been bad.  For instance, a few candies in a pack had a bitter aftertaste.  Tortilla chips and corn chips had an off aftertaste.  It is generally subtle for most items but certain things are more noticable.  I asked others if the things that tasted different to me tasted different to them and they said it tasted normal.  This has continued for about 3 weeks at this point.  Last year I had a presumed case of covid where I completely lost taste and smell for 10 days.  This is very different in that I can still taste, it just seems that my taste buds have changed and it is persistent thus far.

                                                I recieved my second covid 19 vaccine by moderna.  I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

                                                I had COVID-19 and tested positive on December 23rd, 2020. I had a loss of taste and smell. It was not a complete loss.  More like an 80% loss. I received my first COVID vaccine dose on 01/08/2021. By about mid January, however, I had almost all, if not all, of my taste/smell back. But after my second Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine dose, I lost my sense of taste and smell again. When I was at about 90-100% recovered, as of the 2 or 3 days following my 2md vaccine dose, I had lost almost all taste and smell again. As of today, 4 days after the vaccine, I&#39;m back to around 80% again. I have not had any other congestion, etc. that might explain my loss of taste and smell.

Finished a conversation at left the facility after approximately 9:55am. While driving back to office (appx 5 minute drive total), experienced clammy skin, sweating at 3 minutes into drive.  I considered pulling over, though I knew I should be around people where I could be monitored, so continued on. Experienced elevated temperature, blurriness of vision and my vision began to turn bright and white.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I thought I may be passing out.  I got out of the vehicle, sat down on the nearest bench and asked two individuals who where outside to stay with me, and I explained my symptoms to them.  I remained seated for approximately 10 minutes, and when I felt the symptoms subside, went into my office and am now filing this report.

                                                Within 20 minutes of receiving shot, I started having warm rushing sensations on left calf. Over the next few days it traveled to my foot and left arm. Also started developing tingling, pins and needles sensations, numbness and weakness in left leg, foot, forearm and hand. Have experienced prolonged periods of time with muscle spasms in left calf sometimes up to 2 days in length.  A combination of all of these symptoms happen daily. Have had muscle fatigue in right arm and neck at different times Have developed a metallic taste in mouth over the last 2 weeks. After the first 5 days developed extreme mental fatigue and grogginess that lasted 7 days and can sometimes reappear.

I searched for it online and looks like the medical term for it is Tinnitus, Also, There was one occasion that I started to hear my blood flow in my ear for a couple of minutes. The bell while yawning hasn&#39;t gone away after about 2 weeks. Luckily I don&#39;t hear the sound when I am not yawning which is a blessing.

At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                Saturday afternoon (2 days after dose) I broke out in extremely bad hives all over my back, face and head. I called ER to see what I should do because this has never happened before. I&#39;ve never had any allergic reaction to anything and I was concerned since I just received my 2nd dose. ER recommended I come in, since nothing in my normal life changed to cause this also because my lips were getting swollen and throat was scratchy. Once I was checked out in ER they gave me an IV with another antihistamine to get in my system faster. I was releases later that night with a script for prednisone (2 pills for 3 days). Everything was fine Sunday however, i woke up Monday with the rash and hives coming back. I then made another appointment with a Dr, who prescribed more prednisone. Hives have since been gone and not returned.

                                                I am a board certified infectious diseases pharmacist and I have given lectures over hypersenstivites reactions. I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

                                                About 10 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, hives developed on the backs of both of my hands and around my right eye. The hives persisted for 6 days (I took Benadryl to stop the itching). After 6 days of hives I went to a walk-in clinic and they prescribed 5 days of Prednasone. Today I am on my 4th day of the Prednasone and the hives are finally starting to clear up.

The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

No treatment Body aches, fatigue, abdominal cramps, dry lips, dry mouth and throat, sinus pressure, nasal passage closed on one side and closing on the other, pale white skin on back of throat on the right side, chest tightness while laying face-down,  minor nausea, and very tired but unable to stay asleep all night.  Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

                                                Woke up on Friday morning (3/5) with severe neck pain and vertigo. Tried to walk to bathroom and was falling over to the right side and felt very nauseous. Starting throwing up. Arrived at ER around9:30AM and was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged a few hours later. He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

                                                3 days after the shot,  1/3, I started to feel soreness under my tongue.  I&#39;ve felt this before when starting to feel sick.  It progressively got worse, appearing to have peaked on 1/5.  It is painful all the time, but really hurts to extend my tongue and swallow.  While it hurts on both sides, it seems to be worse on the left side.  When I lift my tongue and look in the mirror, it looks like the tissue is swollen some on the left.  I scheduled a visit with the ARNP at my doctor&#39;s office, who I mentioned earlier.  She couldn&#39;t determine an exact cause.  She believed it could possibly be an immune response to the vaccine or something viral.  If it gets worse or doesn&#39;t go away after a week she asked that I call back.   The pain is unresponsive to 400 mg of Ibuprofen.  If I take 800 mg I do get some relief, but can definitely still feel it.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

At the time of patient&#39;s vaccine (01/19/2021), the patient was unaware of his spouse&#39;s COVID-19 status, as they had little contact with others and thought it was a cold. Patient began having COVID-like symptoms on 01/23/2021: cough, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, muscle/body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patient has had two subsequent negative COVID-19 tests while symptomatic. Because of his symptoms, his spouse&#39;s symptoms and positive COVID status, practitioners have cautioned patient to act as if he has COVID. He is under quarantine orders per Public Health. The concern from the patient, Doctors and Public Health officials has been the patient&#39;s negative status while obviously symptomatic, and if he can pass COVID if he is symptomatic but testing negative. He has another test scheduled for Saturday 1/30/2021.

                                                Pt. was at least 15 minutes post receipt of his second dose of Moderna COVID vaccine. He began complaining of dizziness and a headache. We monitored him for over an hour and during that time, he continued to c/o dizziness, frontal headache, photophobia, and worsening when opening his eyes are trying to look straight ahead. We had him isolated in a dim room and had air blowing on him as he complained of being hot. His O2 Sat, pulse , and BP all stayed stable and within normal range. Pt. denied sx of swelling around face/neck or difficulty breathing. RR was stable and unlabored at all times. Pt. refused EMS services and after some time, insisted he needed to get up and leave. Our staff and his co-worker assisted him out of the facility and to a vehicle where we was transported off the premises.  We were informed later through his supervisor that he got worse after leaving and went to the hospital where he &#34;seized.&#34; He is reportedly stable at this time but further information on his condition is unavailable.

Maybe it can be correlated with other individuals with the same effects. I began having sudden vision loss (blurred vision) on Feb 10th and has only gotten worse since.

We kept an eye on him for about 20 minutes, he wasnt wanting to eat his lunch.  His face was also flushed which can be an indicator that he doesn&#39;t have enough prednisone on board.  We gave him an additional dose of his morning prednisone dose, 7.5 mg.  The swelling subsided in about 30 minutes, he ate and said he felt much better.  We will double his evening dose and contact his endocrine doc for more instructions.

A shopper alerted our staff and when I came to check on him, he was just rousing but had his eyes closed due to blurred vision. He was able to speak and look directly at me. He said this reaction had never happened to him before. He seemed jittery probably due to the reaction. Asked for water and was able to drink. He said that he most likely hit his head and compressed his finger during the fall but feels okay. We are not sure how long he was out for.

At approximately 9:30 pm, the patient became cold with shivering.  Temp fluctuated during night between 99 - 103.8. During the night, he experienced nausea and vomiting, dizziness, body aches, and a weird taste in mouth. On 1/7/21, patient still complained of fever, headache, nausea, and the new symptom of diarrhea.  His neck was now very sore, with pain moving it right or left.  On 1/8/21, slight improvement of symptoms.  On 1/8/21 at 7:00 pm, he noticed a very itchy, red raised rash on torso, arms and legs.  He called his physician and was called in a prescription for steroids.  The pharmacy was closed and he picked the steroids up on the morning of 1/9/21.  He took the steroids on 1/9/21  and has noticed major improvements.  Rash still present, but not itching.  Temp currently 99.1, but all other symptoms improved.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

The right side of my bottom lip started tingling about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I had no swelling or other impairment at the time and was released after 40 minutes of observation. A little later the entire right side of my face felt as if it had fallen asleep, approximately 1 hour later and it worsened until about 4 hours later. By the next day the nausea and lightheadedness was gone, and the tingling/numbness to the right side of my face was gone within 48 hours, improving after 24 hours.

                                                Nausea, lightheadedness, and finally numbness to right side of face, slight drooping on right corner of mouth and right side of bottom lip. It began with a tingling feeling in lip. Observing staff did not notice any swelling, or other impairments, asked me if I had anxiety, and sent me on my way. Shortly after, it felt as if I had gotten a shot at the dentist, and had the tingling numbness left over on the right side of my face. About 4 hours later, my bottom lip and right side of my mouth drooped slightly, but I could still smile, talk, raise my arm, so there was no other impairment. By the next day the numbness had mostly subsided, and the nausea and lightheadedness was gone. This vaccine was given to me at a work clinic in the administration building. I do not have contact information for them but was provided a packet with this website. I don&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions, do not have anxiety, am not a hypochondriac, did not even know about the Bell&#39;s Palsy issues in trials until after I felt numbness, and the right side of my face felt as if it fell asleep, like a foot falling asleep but it was my face. It was not to the extent of Bell&#39;s palsy, and may have even been my bottom lip swelling slightly on the right side that caused the droop. It infuriates me that this side effect was dismissed as me having anxiety because I was nervous that my face was going numb which would be a natural reaction for anyone.

                                                I began experiencing a high pitched, singular buzzing in my ears the morning after I received the vaccination. It initially started as an intermittent noise that came and went throughout the day.  Unfortunately, the sound level and length of buzzing both increased as the days passed. By Saturday, March 20th, the buzzing was loud and continuous and was affecting my ability to carry out day to day activities. Now. on March 23rd, I hear the buzz whenever I&#39;m awake. It&#39;s now accompanied by a headache that usually begins in the early afternoon. I haven&#39;t been able to find any respite or cure for the noise, and have been taking Tylenol to help the headache and using a white noise machine to help sleep. I&#39;m very, very hesitant to receive the second dose if the ringing may further worsen.

                                                Severe tinnitus.   I had tinnitus prior to the vaccine that I acquired in June of 2020 from taking Wellbutrin.  In the 2-3 months prior to the Moderna vaccine the tinnitus had quieted down to very tolerable levels for the most part - but would increase during times of stress.   Starting maybe 4-7 days after the first dose of the vaccine my tinnitus is now louder than ever and nonstop 24/7.  I also have had sporadic flashes of earache pains in my right ear...my right ear is where the tinnitus is loudest (was also where it was loudest prior to vaccination)

                                                Patient called me about  4 and a half hours after his immunization. He stated his eyes have become sensitive to light .  He also stated that his bottom lip and chin started to tingle about fifteen minutes after the shot and then went away.  . I recommended that he immediately take a Benadryl tablet and wait a couple of hours I said he can take Benadryl every six hours if he needs to. If his symptoms don&#39;t go away  after two doses of Benadryl  I recommended he go to the Emergency Room and be checked out. Pre -immunization I counselled him  on the normal  run of the mill possible side effects and how to treat them.

                                                On January 1 and 2nd,  approximately 10 days following administration  of Moderna vaccination,  I began to experience both hearing loss and tinnitus in my right ear.   The hearing loss and ringing noise in my right ear came on rather slowly, and progressed over a week&#39;s time.   There was no illness otherwise, and no trauma.  The ringing continued, and I sought out medical care from both Neurology and Otolaryngology.    My otolaryngologist could not find any cause and speculated that it could in fact be from the vaccination.  I underwent oral steroid treatment as well as a series of 3, sequential weekly steroid injections into my middle ear space, though my tympanic membrane.   I also started taking oral L-Lysine at the recommendation of my neurologist as well as other herbals including oral flavonoids to help reduce tinnitus.   None of the above treatments have made any improvement in my symptoms.   I had my hearing rechecked every week at ENT office and the same degree of hearing loss is evident.  None of which has returned to date.  I have most recently just last week begun to a pursue hearing aid device at the recommendation of my ENT physician.    I am currently scheduled for brain MRI to make sure there is not another physiologic cause such as a tumor or hemangioma on my nerve that would possible explain my new symptoms in the right ear.   That study is not completed yet.    The hearing loss and tinnitus is constant, and unchanged, now nearly 7 weeks.    The noise is significant and disturbs my sleep, and much of my daily function.

                                                I&#39;ve had COVID before - back in October of 2020. I had loss of smell and taste almost immediately. It took several months for smell and taste to return, mostly returning by early January 2021. There were slight exceptions.  I received the vaccine on 2/22 and starting on 2/25-2/26, I noticed that my taste has altered significantly. Almost everything I eat tastes like smoke. I&#39;ve had everything from eggs to steak to bread. Even drinking coffee or wine tastes like I am drinking a smokey liquid. I&#39;m not sure why this is happening and it has not improved since.   Sense of smell continues to remain in okay condition.

I also had a number of large hives acrss my right bicep and elbow, as well as a few smaller hives on my back and underneath my feet.    This reaction was the same reaction I received when I went to the ER on 12/10/2018 for difficulty breathing and an elevated BP.  The ER administered TORODOL and I reacted the same way, ending up in the ER the very next day due to the reaction.    I believe, after much diligent research, the reaction I received to the COVID vaccine was due to the Tromethamine in it, as this ingredient is also in TORODOL.
