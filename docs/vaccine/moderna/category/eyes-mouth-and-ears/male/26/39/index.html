                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

                                                For BOTH initial (022621) and booster (032621) of Moderna, pt had moderate/severe eye reaction. Overnight about 3 days after first injection and 4 days after second injection.  Initial injection: pt went to bed on the 3rd night after vaccine having taken no medications and noted mild eye irritation. He woke up a few hours later (~midnight) to severe eye watering and blurriness which required him to keep his eyes closed with mild sinus congestion. No difficulty breathing noted. Pt had trouble getting it to stop despite taking loratadine 10mg and rinsing eyes with water. Pt seriously considered going to ER due to risk of blindness. Pt eventually fell asleep a few hours later and woke up with very sensitive eyes (irritated, very red) that took about 36h to fully recover.   Second injection: pt was on scheduled loratadine 10mg daily. Noted a similar eye irritation (this time four days after injection not three) when going to bed and took 50mg diphenhydramine (about 14h after loratadine dose). Woke up a few hours later to more minor but still debilitating eye watering with proportionally more sinus involvement. No difficulty breathing noted. Pt took an extended release pseudoephedrine, rinsed eyes with water  and waited for it to resolve about an hour or two later. Pt awoke the next morning to much less sensitive eyes than first time.   Note: due to first experience. From time of administration of second dose, pt was on scheduled naproxen (440mg loading dose followed by 220mg q12h), loratadine 10mg q24h,  and pseudoephedrine (120mg ER q24h). Pt took these scheduled days 1-3 and at time of second eye episode was only on scheduled loratadine still. Pt also had 50mg diphenhydramine on hand in case of episode.

                                                Patient noted on form that he had a severe reaction to peanuts which causes him to have anaphylaxis.  He stated that he does carry an EpiPen and any time anything with peanuts touches his mouth/lips he immediately notices his throat starting to close.  He also is allergic to cats.  Before administering the vaccine, the patient noted that he does not like needles and was not going to look.  I administered the vaccine and the patient and I exited the vaccination room.  I explained that he should sit in the waiting area for about 30 minutes due to his severe allergic reaction in the past.  By the time that I walked back into the pharmacy, the patient&#39;s wife shouted &#34;He&#39;s not breathing!&#34;.  My technicians called 911 while I grabbed an EpiPen and rushed to the patient.  I immediately administered a 0.3 mg dose of epinephrine and observed that the patient had passed out, was not breathing, but had a pulse.  A few seconds later he regained consciousness and his breathing was erratic.  I gave him water and he stated that he felt very lightheaded and dizzy.  I instructed him to remain seated.  He also noted that his vision was blurry and he saw a black dot.  His wife was fanning him to cool him down while I tried to obtain the patient&#39;s blood pressure, but could not get a reading.  The paramedics came and evaluated him thoroughly.  His blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, and blood sugar were all within normal limits.  They determined that the syncope was most likely due to the patient not eating during the day and not liking needles.  The patient was feeling much better and declined further medical treatment, including going to the hospital.  He was instructed to go home and relax.

                                                Patient received dose 1 of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately 5-10 minutes after administration, the patient&#39;s mother alerted me that the patient was feeling faint and sweaty. I came to check on the patient. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. Patient said his vision was narrowing and he subsequently lost consciousness for approximately 10-20 seconds. I checked the patient&#39;s blood pressure and initial result was 88/64. Upon regaining consciousness, patient reported immediately feeling better. His blood pressure was still low at 94/70. He remained seated and drank some cold water and a cool compress was applied to his forehead. I questioned the patient to determine if he was experiencing any other symptoms that may indicate anaphylaxis (skin itchiness, tight throat, stomach upset) and he denied any other symptoms. I continued to monitor the patient for approximately 30 minutes. During monitoring, the patient told me he is nervous of needles, and has fainted trying to give blood in the past. After 30 minutes of monitoring, diaphoresis had resolved, color returned to patient&#39;s face, blood pressure recheck was 116/84, and patient self-reported feeling fine. He was escorted home by his mother.

                                                After my initial Covid vaccine shot, I had a strange sensation of tinnitus in my right ear. Sounds felt slightly deafened, like I was hearing at 75% efficiency out of that ear, but there wasn&#39;t any ringing sound for me like typical tinnitus. After my second Covid vaccine, this symptom got worse and I became more sensitive to loud noises and sounds, as well as being able to hear my heartbeat in my right ear which felt like a throbbing or pulsing sensation. This leads me to believe it is pulsatile tinnitus. The feeling comes and goes with various frequency and intensity throughout the day.

I also had a slight amount of constricting in my vision.  This lasted for less than 20 minutes and I was able to walk out of the facility no problem. It&#39;s been a few days now and I think my hearing is still slightly degraded but it&#39;s hard to say for sure. I can hear fine, there may be some slight ringing though.

                                                Pt was given vaccine after all DURs were verified. After vaccine patient stood and walked to waiting area with out issue. After 5-7 minutes patient lifted his arm getting our attention. Came out to patient were he said his vision was getting very blurry. Said he could not read the sign 6 feet in front of him. I touched his shoulder as a precaution and asked if he could see me. He stated yes and proceeded to put his head back and take down his mask and close his eyes. I asked pharmacy staff to call a code. His forehead and back of his neck were visibly wet from sweating. He moved his head forward and hung it down for 3 seconds before lifting it saying his vision was back. I asked if he had any blurriness or faintness still and he verbally said no. I asked if I could get some water for him and he said yes. I also gave him a granola bar and he said that it helped a lot. We also brought paper towel for his forehead and neck. He then stated that he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. He felt embarrassed that we had to call a code and get more people involved. His color came back 3-5 minutes after he initially lifted his head and said his vision was back. Pharmacy made pt sit another 15 minutes after his color came back. Watched patient stand up after the 15 minutes and pt said he felt good. Told patient we would be sending reports about what happened and if it was okay with him to provide his information to be contacted if needed, he agreed.

                                                I had complete loss of smell and taste November 26th and tested positive for Covid-19 on the 28th. At the time, it started as my smell and taste fading out. Day one of noticeable symptoms also included a slight fever at approximately 99.7 degrees, full body aches as if I&#39;d been in a car accident, chills, a headache, shortness of breath and fatigue. The fever and chills and body aches had gone away after only two days but the shortness of breath and fatigue persisted at least 3 weeks or late December.  By January, I was slowly having my smell and taste back to normal. Early in February, around Feb. 4th, after my first vaccine and approximately 5 days before my second one, my smell and taste became horribly distorted. It started with mint and toothpaste. It started tasting/smelling like mold with pottery clay. After about 2 or three days, almost all foods began tasting and smelling like it was musty, moldy and rotten. Like dead fish or expired meat.  I first noticed with food but now it&#39;s other things as well. Cleaning agents like disinfectant wipes smell the exact same as a jar of peanut butter which is a strong, musty, moldy smell.  A pot roast bought the day of at Kroger was cooked by my fiance and it smelled so rancid to me I almost vomitted. Almost everything smells and tastes horrible and it&#39;s been about two weeks. The only things that seem normal are bubblegum, fruity pebbles and most beverages although not all. Coffee has the same pungent smell.  I have has to switch my diet almost completely to yogurt, fruity pebbles and meal replacement shakes. Along with a multivitamin so I don&#39;t miss anything.

He as sweating profusely and had vision loss. He was sitting while this all happened which I think prevented him from fainting. I got him water, an ice pack and called ems. By the time EMS arrived the patient was starting to feel better. EMS did their evaluation on site and the patient was able to go home 20 minutes later.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine 03/11/2021 received first dose of Moderna. By next day, expected flu-like symptoms were apparent such as chills, headache, and body aches. Then, full body muscle twitches and motor tics began. The continue six weeks later. On the 7th day post-vaccine, early AM sleep paralysis/seizure sensation 4-5 times before falling back asleep. When awoken, unilateral weakness (right side). Right eye vision blurry. Right ear muffled. Subjective weakness and numbness in right arm and leg. Went to ER and was admitted under suspicion of TIA or mild stroke. CT w/oC appeared unremarkable. Scheduled for a brain MRI following day (3/19) WWO contrast. Appeared unremarkable, so acute ischaemia was ruled out. Blood work was done repeatedly during stay (CBC, metabolic, CRP, sed rate, urinalysis). Everything was unremarkable. Discharged with instruction to follow-up if symptoms did not improve. The unilateral weakness is intermittent six weeks later. On 4/20, allergist tested against components of Moderna vaccine intradermally. This showed a reaction compared to the negative control. Allergist advised to avoid further vaccination with any of the ingredients in Moderna. Allergist posited that symptoms could be a latent reaction to the allergy, but wasn&#39;t sure as prolonged presentation seems unlikely. Future follow-ups: rheumatologist to rule out acute autoimmune reaction, 4/21/21. Neurologist second opinion 5/4/21. Primary care evaluation, as PCP was on leave for several months, 5/19/21.

I asked if he wanted me to call the ambulance and he said yes. I gave patient a bottle of water and Orange Juice (confirmed non diabetic). It seemed like he was having an anxiety or panic attack. EMT came in and took him to the hospital, at that time he said he started feeling better.

I also noticed a sudden pain in my chest around noon on 5/1/21 that felt like someone had punched my sternum and bruised it. That has also not gone away yet. It hurts to put any pressure on my palms or lift anything heavy.

                                                Woke up at 3:00 AM Friday 5/24 having chest pain near my heart and issues breathing. I sat up on the corner of my bed feeling dizzy. Every time I would take anything more than a light breath, I would get a tight pain on the left side of my chest, which specifically felt like I had blockage in my heart. As I sat on the corner of my bed I tried to control my breathing and started to rub the area as I was taking breaths. The sharp pain in my chest while taking normal / deep breaths lasted for a few minutes and I feared I was having a heart attack. After going away initially that night, I felt the sensation  in a less intense fashion again later on Friday night and once more got a slight tight feeling in my chest while breathing on Saturday. During the initial episode on Friday night, I also got a deafened noise in my ears as if they had to pop as if I was gaining altitude in a plane or something. I got up off my bed to go to the bathroom and sat to urinate in case I was going to faint. The deafened noise went away after about a minute or so and turned into a static / fizzy noise for another minute or two while I was in the bathroom.  (The static fizz sounds got louder as I put my chin to my chest for some reason.) I was also sweating profusely throughout this entire process.

                                                Right ear started ringing suddenly Friday may 14 2021 as I was sitting down at my computer after work. It has been growing in intensity over time since then, and on may 25th 2021 I went to urgent care, advised them I thought I may have a wax or ear infection problem and was prescribed  &#34;ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution commonly known as: FLOXIN&#34; and have been taking the daily drops. The ringing is getting worse and the only thing I can think of that changed in my life recently was the vaccine. I no longer suspect ear infection as I have experienced those before and never taken this long to recover, much less getting worse while taking medication. My day to day life otherwise has been the same. The ringing is so deafening now I cannot sleep and I wanted to make record of this before seeking additional medical help in the morning.

                                                Chest pain made worse with any form of exercise also developed throat pain, soreness, dryness. Took a week off work to rest and felt better after doctor prescribed metoprolol and aspirin. Metoprolol for high heart rate and aspirin for chest pain. Went back to work on 6/22/21 and felt fine until around 12AM when chest started hurting again. Have not taken second dose of vaccine due to symptoms. Went to 3 doctors and only one believes me when i say it is because of the vaccine. Have not been able to help or give advice with symptoms aside from the medication I am currently taking.

Loss of vision lasted for 1 minute.  Loss of vision occurred while standing.  Referral to primary care and ophthalmology specialist found normal eye exam and MRI of orbits but  presence of tachycardia especially while standing (fluctuations between 60 beats at rest/laying down to 130 beats per minute standing).   Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)  is suspected.  Currently pursuing cardiac workup with cardiologist and Covid POTS specialist.  POTS specialist believes autoantibody development after vaccination could be suspected as recovering covid patients similarly present to clinic with POTS like symptoms.

                                                4 days later after the vaccine my left eye turned really red with crust and mucus coming out. I went to walk in clinic and was being treated for pink eye. I was started on an antibiotic eye drop. A day later my right eye started to have the same problem. I scheduled an appt with a eye specialist where he examined both eyes and said I had a major infection. I was started on steroid eye drops which I am still taking but seems my eyes are not getting better. I have a follow up with another specialist next week for further testing. I have been out of work due to this matter.

                                                Patient was given the immunization and as I was talking to him after the immunization he told me his palms were sweaty and he wasn&#39;t feeling well. His pupils got large and he then passed out. Code white was called, 911 was called, we got an ice pack and placed on his chest and a cold rag on his head. After about 10 seconds, he regained alertness. EMT arrived and accessed the patient. His blood pressure was normal and pulse was normal. He was given a cold drink and sat in the chair until he felt better.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

Been happening consistently upon waking up every morning. Fullness in right ear with slightly increased perception of tinnitus.

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine  at 2:55pm on 4/7.  An hour or two later, I started to get a sore throat.  The sore throat was very painful by the early morning of 4/8.  On 4/8 I went into a doctor to see if I had strep throat because of the level of pain and since I didn&#39;t think I could get a sore throat from the vaccine, but he said it was not strep and that it was likely just a side effect of the vaccine.  On 4/8 I also had a fever topping 101.4, fatigue (I slept a lot that day), mental fog, pain at injection site, and all-around body pain.  The sore throat lessened greatly by 4/9, so it clearly wasn&#39;t a strep infection and seems it was indeed a side effect of the vaccine.  From 4/9 through 4/11 I had general &#34;cold&#34; symptoms: runny nose, phlegmy, watery eyes, redness and pain at injection site, muscle aches, elevated temperature (not fever), and general fatigue. By 4/12, these symptoms are nearly completely gone.  Some of these symptoms seemed quite strange as side effects from the vaccine, but they started and perfectly paralleled the expected vaccine side-effects, which makes me think they were caused by the vaccine.  I have no reason to think I had another illness at the same time as when I was experiencing these side-effects.  I had had Covid-19 previously (in December 2020; I tested positive and had mild symptoms).  Perhaps having had Covid-19 already provoked these strange side-effects.

Patient&#39;s head went back as if he was falling asleep, but  he began making gurgling noises and his eyes rolled to the back of his head.  Helped him slide him down out of the chair, so he would not hit his head or fall.  Once on the floor the patient began seizing. After a sternum rub, the patient raised up and was helped back into the chair.  He was sweating  and flushed.  He was able to answer questions as we awaited the EMT to arrive.

I called a pharmacy technician into the room with me, and got him a water. He slumped in the chair, fainted, as his head fell back  he made a groaning noise, eyes rolled. I went into get the radio to call code white and when I returned he had come to, and was asking to lay on the floor. He was sweating and clammy. The optical manager, helped me and pharmacy technician get him to the floor. He did not want an ambulance because he was starting to feel better. After 15 minutes of water and cold pack on his neck, he was recovered. He was talking and up walking. He left with his brother and brother&#39;s girlfriend.

                                                I developed tinnitus about three weeks after the first injection of the Moderna vaccine into my left arm. I received the second dose in my right arm on April 15. The ringing in my ears has persisted since then. The four days leading up to the sudden onset of the tinnitus were the most stressful of my life, for non-vaccine related reasons. I wonder if the extreme anxiety may have played a role in the onset of tinnitus. The volume of the ringing can vary. It sometimes appears to be mainly in the left ear, but sometimes it&#39;s in both.

                                                Injection site was left arm below the shoulder around the tricep.  The injection site began itching several hours after injection. Itching was low in intensity.  The injection site swelled noticeably.  I went to sleep but I woke around 4 AM with an intense headache, nausea, slightly blurred vision, and a fever. Throughout the remaining day my fever got up to 101F.  Other symptoms included muscle ache and fatigue.  The injection site began intermittently pulsating/twitching the evening of 5/20/21.  On Friday morning 5/21 the intermittent twitching spread to my left fingers.   The blurry vision, headache, and nausea gradually went away.  All symptoms were gone by morning of 5/22.  I did not take any medication throughout.

                                                Started the day great and went and got the 2nd dose of Moderna on 6/12/21 at 940am. I felt fine throughout the day and I started getting a little dizzy and disoriented around 5pm  and as it was explained to me it would be expected to get side effects. Later in the evening around 8pm I started to get extremely dizzy, tired, and having a low grade fever of 100.5F. I Later developed a headache and I had to go lie down for the rest of the night. As I was sleeping throughout the night and waking up multiple times shivering and being extremely cold, I was taking my temperature throughout the night and It would be climbing up from 100.5F and it reached 103.7F. At that point I wanted to get up and take some fever reducer medicines but I was unable to get out of the bed as I was very dizzy and disoriented and I was having extreme muscle and joint pains that I wasnt unable to move at all. I needed to go to the restroom and get a drink and I was unable to do that.  I had considered going to the ER but I waited it out and wouldnt go unless my temperature kept rising. I eventually tried going to the bathroom but at that point I had passed out and woke up in the morning between my bedroom and bathroom. On sunday 6/13 I was continuing to have symptoms and felt extremely ill throughout the day.  I woke up and the fever had gone away but I still had the symptoms mentioned above and also had ringing in my ears. Throughout the day I was trying to do stuff around the house but I was unable to do that and go to work. I would randomly pass out at times either on my desk or just sitting on the couch. That was throughout sunday then on monday I was feeling a lot better almost all symptoms had gone away but I was still a bit dizzy and had body aches and was unable to go to work and do basic stuff around the house. Tuesday I was mostly feeling fine but still felt a bit dizzy and disoriented and extremely fatigued but I was able to go to work. Wednesday I am feeling almost 100% normal but I do get dizzy at times and I am still extremely fatigued.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

I used my Epipen and took Benadryl to help the allergic symptoms subside. After this treatment, the symptoms subsided and I did not seek further medical attention as it was unnecessary.  I was in the care of my father who is a physician.

He  states he was fine yesterday, but this morning has noticed body aches (not unusual with an immunization) and also labored breathing, vision changes, and a rapid heartrate (which could be related to allergy).  He states this has been going on intermittently this morning, and I recommended either getting in to his doctor, or discussing with a nurse.  I did let him know that Benadryl may help as well.  I called to notify his doctor.

                                                gave patient vaccination in designated vaccine area after going over possible side effects. vaccine was given in left arm. I asked patient if he felt ok to move to observation area. patient said yes and stood up and walked to observation area. he sat down and I told him I would be right back. I turned around and was walking back into the pharmacy when I heard a loud crash. I turned around and patient was slumped side ways about to fall out of chair. He had fainted or had a seizure (he was very stiff, redness to face, eyes open and fixed). I ran over to him and a pharm tech and I got him to the floor immediately. He regained consciousness within 5-10 seconds after placing him on floor. he asked how long was he out. he stated he had this seizure happen before but never after a vaccine. he said he has had multiple vaccines like hepatitis b and this never happened. he states it happens when he has something done to him that causes intense pain. he said it happened after hurting his ankle or when he hit his hand in a fan. checked his BP-172/100 pulse-65.  paramedics came to check him out. BP still elevated. he walked out with paramedics.

Throat felt dry during the same period, leading to unusually high water intake and frequent urination, and briefly some discomfort and slight pain around the front-right part of waist that I assume was due to too much water and urination. Also Thursday night, I had some potential chills ? but no fever when I checked Friday morning. Also during this three-day period I felt fatigue, and lay in bed most of the day Friday. Also during this three-day period  I was congested and had a runny nose, but I have had those for weeks presumably due to allergies  Today I feel mostly but not quite healthy.

When I went to evaluate the patient he was very warm and was breaking out in sweats. He said his vision was very blurry. The patient lost consciousness and had convulsions/lower extremity rigidity for about 30 seconds to a minute. Patient regained consciousness and did not have any more convulsions. Patient was drenched it sweat but slowly regained color and he said his vision was returning to normal. Patient did not remember losing consciousness. EMS was called during the episode and patient was taken for further evaluation by EMS.

This was my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. It is not debilitating, and overall I still feel that the benefits outweigh the risks. I am still planning to get my second dose. This was an observation, and I was asked by the coronavirus hotline to fill out a report after I called to inquire about this symptom. I will be monitoring closely to see if it worsens on the second dose of the vaccine, which is scheduled for April 24th 2021 at 2:45pm

Third day was completely fine (4/20), Morning of fourth day (4/21) wave of dizziness and fatigue began accompanied with feeling of pressure in ears with occasional ringing. Also headache at the back of the head and where the cervical spine meets the skull. Occasional congestion. Hard to concentrate and occasional lightheaded feeling. Going on one week since injection and 3rd day of dizzy spells. (4/24)  Treatment: Drinking mostly water. Diet consisting mostly of vegetables and grains (no changes have been made to my diet) Ibuprofen 200mg seems to alleviate earache which in turn relieves some dizziness but feeling of being off balance remains.  No previous history of any sort of vertigo or ear infections.

No treatment administered regularly, ibuprofen taken one time.  Headaches have been reported through last week and seem to have subsided as of a few days ago.  Onset of chronic tinnitus and individual &#34;tinnitus events&#34; roughly ~2 weeks after vaccination.    7 &#34;tinnitus events&#34; have been experienced where the patient reports rapid onset auditory muting in one or both ears with the onset of an audible frequency and will persist for roughly 5 seconds before quickly fading.  The frequency has been both low frequency as well has high frequency during different events, and this has happened in each ear individually as well as both ears, random between events.  The most recent tinnitus event happened yesterday, so the condition is ongoing.  Chronic tinnitus has been reported as well, with a mild case of constant high-pitched tinnitus (roughly 8khz tone) that has continued from 2 weeks post vaccination to today.

About 2 or 3 minutes after vaccination the patient got up and walked to the pharmacy counter and fainted in front of the counter.  He may have hit his head.  He was conscious and remembered walking over but lost vision and fainted.  He sat up on his own in front of the counter and was given an ice pack.  He said he would feel better laying down so we  had him lay down in the IMZ area on a mat.  Paramedics arrived shortly after.  Paramedics assisted the patient and determined no medical care was necessary but recommended the patient not drive himself home.  The patient waited in the IMZ area until his dad arrived.  He said he did not eat today so he was given a powerade and a protein bar at no charge.  The patient then left with his dad.

I administered the patient with his second shot of the moderna, then he sat on the chair in the waiting area after his vaccine. I then gave his fiancé her 2nd shot of the moderna. As I was done giving the shot, his fiancé and I noticed his eyes are rolling backwards and he started to faint in the chair.  Then his wife and I tried to waking him. He regained conscience after 20 seconds or more. He was extremely hot so I got him a water.  I had him wait 10 minutes after so I can monitor him.

Within 24 hours of the vaccine my tounge went numb, although I couldn&#39;t taste on my tounge I can in the rest of my mouth. I also started to feel heavy fatigue, headaches and chills. These symptoms continued into the next day (22nd) with the addition of jaw tightness and ear pain. The fatigue and headache went away at the end of the day on the 22nd. When I woke up on the 23rd half my face was numb and I am unable to smile correctly, movement of my eye brows has been impared and the use of my right eyelid, as it is not able to close completely. My tounge is still numb, the persistent use of which causes muscle tightness. Yawns and other large movements of my jaw can cause the muscle under the tounge to freeze up which is painful. went to urgent care as soon as I could and was told this could be a rare side effect but they told me based on my symptoms I have bell palsy. I was prescribed acyclovir, lorazepam, and prednisone.

Patient reported that a similar reaction occurred with other shots he had received in the past.  After being checked by EMT patient returned to pharmacy to report that he was feeling fine about 20 minutes after this event started.

                                                I got the 2nd dose on 06/06/2021 and then for a couple days after my heart was pounding and I was just tired. I felt tightening in my chest, intermittent pain in upper back. Periodically this would come in waves. My hands felt like pins and needles kind of flushed over my body. It was mainly hands and feet but I would feel it in my face and sometimes arms and legs. I did go to the ER about a week after 2nd dose (around 06/13/2021). They told me it could&#39;ve been anxiety and stress. They did an EKG, blood work, and x-ray and didn&#39;t find anything abnormal. I did f/u with PCP and I just went last week and explained symptoms there as well and they&#39;re looking into my issues. They told me today I had a high white blood cell count and that my liver has elevated enzymes. They want me to come in the middle of July to do more fasting blood work. No fever, no malaise, but I did feel tired and fatigued and nauseous. I had bad brain fog and my body felt like it wasn&#39;t mine. It was like someone took my brain and put inside someone else&#39;s body. 1 week after 2nd dose I had bad sinus pressure behind eyes like my eyes were going to burst out of skull.

                                                Hours after vaccination I began to have a fever.  Woke up with body aches and a fever of 104.00  Fahrenheit. Fever lasted 24 hours, body aches lasted a full week including severe headache. I started experiencing severe pain on my left eye by day three post vaccination. I had to seek medical attention and was diagnosed with scleritis. Doctor encouraged me to file a report on my symptoms. I also got mouth sores and pain in my throat. Tonsils were inflamed and red.

Everything has a similar odor, where good things smell more mediocre, and bad things smell &#34;less bad&#34; if that makes sense. Everything is taking on the same sense and smell, but not 100%. I can still smell peanut butter or a rose and tell what it is, but it is drastically different and can be unpleasant. Food is not as enjoyable and neither are smells. All my foods are taking on the same smell and taste.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

I took a melatonin to boost this effect, and was cozily asleep by 6 PM, T&#43;3. 5:00 AM, T&#43;14: woke up chilly and overall mildly sore. Normal temperature. Very mild headache behind the eyes. No Tylenol yet for anything. Chills compounded by the fact I was  wearing the same T-shirt from the day. I changed into a long-sleeve pajama turtleneck, pull-over sweater, and put on socks, and went back to sleep.  7 AM, T&#43;16: Soreness and chills fading. Arm still a bit sore but less than shot #1. 8 AM, T&#43;17: Headache and soreness comparable to a rough hangover. Moving slow today. No Tylenol needed yet. 11:30 AM: Mild fever of 100.7. Headache and soreness have remained mild. 2:30 PM (T&#43;23.5): Fever of 101.0 (peak) 6:30 PM (T&#43;27.5): Fever reduced to 99.5. 8:00 PM (T&#43;29): Finally took some Tylenol with dinner for bedtime. 8:30 PM: temperature back to my normal baseline. 11:00 PM (T&#43;32): Feeling back to normal, though worn out from the day.

                                                Two days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, I got a pain behind my right ear. The next day, my tongue became numb, specifically focused on the right side. This caused me to lose taste on that same right side. A few days passed and I started to experience numbing on the right side of my face. The following Saturday (4/10/2021), I met with my cousin, a practicing neurologist, to discuss and test my symptoms. He determined that I have a mild case of Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                Around 8am in the morning, I got a intramuscular shot in my left arm on/around the deltoid muscle. I stayed at the vaccine administration location for about 30 minutes to ensure I felt okay, and left. Around 8:45 am I noticed the left side of my face was going numb. By 9am, a 2&#34; radius around my rear molars was completely numb. I immediately called the doctor who oversaw the administration and began constant communication with the doctor. I did not loose any functionality of muscles, my ability to talk, eat, or breathe. I simply felt like I had a very strong novacane shot to the upper rear gum and that numbness radiated out.  Under regular communications with the doctor and his team, I did daily check ins and updates with how I felt. The numbness started to wear off after 10 days of no medical intervention. 13 days post injection was the last day I felt any numbness. 14 days after injection I felt fine. I have not gotten the second shot. I have not felt any side effects since then.

                                                Patient received vaccine, was waiting for about 5 minutes in the waiting area when another customer yelled &#34;He&#39;s passing out!&#34;. Upon running over, I noticed that the patients eyes rolled in the back of his head, his legs were straight out, and was making &#34;groaning&#34; noises. He was in this state for about 30 seconds. 9-1-1 was called immediately and patient was given water. When asked if he knew where he was, he stated &#34;a pharmacy store for my COVID shot.&#34; He told me he remembers everything, saying he felt like he was in a dream during seizure. Questioned if he had ever had seizures before and he stated once when he was giving blood. No shortness of breath or hives noticed, therefore no EpiPen was administer. Ambulance arrived and asked similar questions that we had asked, and patient stated he was &#34;just hot.&#34; He also seemed a bit yellow in color. Patient was able to stand up and walk to the ambulance with little to no help. All of this occurred in about 10 minutes total.

                                                HCP confidently diagnosed me with Bell&#39;s Palsy. It came on suddenly and without much warning. I woke up to find that the right side of my face was weak - right eye hard to close, weak lower lip, and even foods/drinks had different or less taste. These symptoms have worsened a bit, most noticeable being my less active right eyelids and the weakness in my lips/face muscles (right side) makes it hard/embarrassing to talk or laugh, as my mouth becomes contorted.

                                                Around the 17th of June I started feeling facial ticks or spasms under my right eye.  The next few days it was beginning difficult to talk and my eye was not blinking completely.   I could not feel my face.  I went to the health department and they did some test.  The diagnosed it as bells palsy.  They prescribed me prednisone to take.  They wanted me to follow-up in three weeks.  I still have very little movement in my face.  I have been on the prednisone for about a week now.

I haven?t been able to sleep since then and my fever has spiked as high as 104.5. I?m also experiencing headache, ear aches, mild sore throat, nausea, and chest tightness/pain during deep breathing. No shortness of breath symptoms though. Aleve and Tylenol do not appear to be helping. I feel worse than when I had Covid back in November.

                                                I had vaccine on 1/10/2021. I did not have any symptom at the time of vaccination. I started feeling Fever with Chills on 1/15/21 evening and then I had headache, and next day I lost smell and taste. I thought these are all COVID symptoms and went for lab testing for SARS RT PCR testing on 1/18/ 21. The result was Detected. I am now feeling well. I went for another testing again for the same test and waiting for the result. Now my question is I have second dose scheduled at 2/7/2021. What if my second lab result comes Negative and What if my second lab result comes Positive? I want to know if i need to take a shot or not? I was isolated in my room at home for all these days and still isolated until I get my result.

He reported sudden sense of nausea, tunnel vision, headache and light sensitivity. He returned to the clinic shortly after leaving due to his condition. We had him rest in one of the outpatient rooms while monitoring his vitals, was also given an instant ice pack for his head. The pt. was prescribed Banophen (anti-histamine), Ondansetron for nausea and Ibuprofen 800mg for pain relief. He was given 6 TAB of both the Ondansetron and Ibuprofen but took 1 tablet of each of the 3 medications after coming into the exam room. Our patient relaxed in the room and was closely monitored for 45mins.-1hr. following coming back. Pt. began feeling better about 30mins. into his stay where he waited another 20-30mins. to ensure symptoms resided and he felt better. He was free to leave once better. Instructions were to contact our clinic or return if the headache or nausea returned or if his symptoms worsened.

I woke up around the10 am  the 25th.the next day. I had a migraine that wouldn&#39;t go away. I was feeling nauseous and still had a light sensitive headache. I took Migraine medication, and eventually mid afternoon the symptoms went away. Less than 24 hours later I was back to normal. March 4th I was using Gold Bond Ultimate Mens lotion and had an adverse reaction. My hand swelled up, and got red.  I took Benadryl and it went away. March 5th I used Curel lotion and the same thing happened. Did not take Benadryl.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Swelling of the throat occurred between 45 mins and 1 hour after Vaccine. Treated with 1 Benadryl and 1 Claritin near the 45 minute mark. Symptoms improved about 1 hour and 30 minutes after getting the vaccine and were no longer noticeable by 3 PM (approx 3 hours after vaccine). After the throat swelling receded I noticed a little bit of numbness in the tongue and throat for another 1-2 hours (4-5 hours after the vaccine). Swelling of throat was uncomfortable but not severe enough to cause breathing issues. There were also no problems swallowing or speaking.

About a minute later he started hollering for us.  We went over to him and he said he was dizzy and his eyes were blacking out.  I took his BP.  It was 88/64.  He said he had not eaten so we got him some fruit juice and crackers.  He said he was feeling better so I took his BP again.  It was 130/94.  He waited a few more minutes and then went home.  This happened over a period of 15 min.

                                                At approximately 9:00 PM (roughly 11.5 hours after vaccination)  I became extremely light headed with slurred speech. I experienced tunnel vision and dizziness. My face turned white, and my lips were a blue color. I sat down immediately, which improved my condition temporarily.   But, within 2 minutes I began experiencing tunnel vision and dizziness again while sitting upright. I laid down on my back and elevated my legs.  My vision returned and but I remained dizzy and pale. I experienced some numbness and tingling in my extremities.  My wife attached a fingertip pulse oximeter to my finger at this time (we did not have a tool to check blood pressure on hand). My blood %SpO2 read between  95 and 98% and pulse ranged from 95 to 101 bpm.  I did NOT experience: difficulty breathing, swelling of the airway, nor itching.   Since I was not having difficulty breathing, and my symptoms seemed to indicate low blood pressure or potentially low blood sugar I decided to wait it out and see if my symptoms worsened.    While laying on the floor, I consumed a glass of milk and a few oreo cookies, hoping to counter hypoglycemia (if that&#39;s what was going on).  After approximately 15 minutes my condition began to improve - I could sit up slightly with only mild dizziness and color began returning to my face. After approximately 30 minutes, I was able to stand and walk to my couch and lay down. After around an hour, I was feeling almost back to normal with only a slight dizziness and tiredness remaining.  12 hours after the adverse event (24 hours post vaccination) I feel okay, slightly lightheaded but generally fine. I intend to call a doctor and discuss if any further tests are necessary.

                                                was diagnosed with high-frequency hearing loss and tinnitus BEFORE vaccine. My tinnitus was not bad the day of or had flared up before taking the vaccine.   1-2 days after having the first dosage of the vaccine I noticed my tinnitus was a lot worse, more noticeable, extremely high pitched, and unbearable for most of the time, on top of the &#34;sickness&#34; and &#34;sore arm&#34; symptoms. This lasted a couple of days (about 3-4 days) after the vaccine. This also happened for the second dose I received on 4/1/21.  I did check in my symptoms on the v-check application (first dose only).

                                                &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   About 45 minutes after my shot, my left arm started hurting, basically going down from the injection site to my elbow. AT 1:30 am - 4/9/2021 (14 hours after shot), I awoke out of my sleep and was freezing. I got up and layer up on clothing and drank some water. From 1:30 am - 5:45 am- 4/9/2021, I was wide awake, but tired , yawning, freezing, and had a temp of 99.9. My mouth got very dry and I was drink just a little water, but found myself having to run to the restroom once an hours. My temp slowly got down to 99.2 by 5:30am. During this time, I was also nauseous from shaking so much from being cold. I slept for another 15 minutes and then was wide awake from 6:10 am- 7:30  and then fell asleep till 9:30am. As of 12:00pm, - 4-9-2021 I have slept maybe 4 hrs, I have a headache, my arm is throbbing and I am tired. I also feel like I have a bunch of mucus in my throat (but that could be from allergies).

                                                I had COVID in early December. During this time I lost my taste and smell and it came back two weeks later.   After receiving my first vaccine, I had the normal symptoms of someone receiving their second shot. I&#39;ve read this is common among younger people who have previously had COVID. I had two days of fever and chills, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m report this.  My taste and smell has been altered since the day after my vaccine. For weaker smells, I don&#39;t pick them up at all. Stronger smells either smell excessively sweet or burnt. I can pick up about 20% of the smell of something and the other 80% is this weird sweet or burnt flavor, but never both. Garbage, gasoline, hand sanitizer all have the same sweet smell. Most food smells burnt.  My taste is similar. Some food has a burnt flavor. Beef, previously a favorite food of mine, has a nauseating taste to it that prevents me from eating too much of it.   I have read that some people are experiencing post-COVID parosmia, but given that mine came on immediately after my vaccine I can&#39;t help but wonder if there is a correlation. It&#39;s been nearly a month without much improvement.

                                                So I got the vaccine on January 23rd and the Sunday following I started noticing I was getting very dizzy I went to the ear doctor they said it was not my inner ear so I went to a heart doctor and they did a tilt table test and the tilt table suggested orthostatic hypotension. The heart doctor did alot of heart tests and the heart is good. My vision was blurry with constant headaches went to an eye doctor and I have onset strabismus in my right eye and then I went to a neurologist because the tips of my toes were numb . The heart doctor has me on fludrocortisone and metropolol because my heart rate was very high all the time ever since the vaccine it was stuck at 130 to 150 beats per minute no matter if I was resting or sitting. My pupils oscillate and ever since the adverse reaction started I have had pupillary athetosis or hippus. Horrible brain fog can&#39;t think clearly or sleep well insomnia came with all of this as well. I go to the mayoclinic, because dysautonomia is expected.

                                                Started with mild headaches about 14 days in. Noticed increase in tinnitus (already had tinnitus) around 17 days after. Tinnitus became  debilitating with addition of second tone, resulting in repeated panic attacks at night and anxiety throughout the day. Severe impairment of daily activities with huge disruption of sleep and work.  Saw ENT and then family doctor who had to prescribe anxiety medication to control anxiety.

As he was sitting down his head threw back, he stiffened, his eyes moved left to right, and he was not responding.  The nurse and I immediately tried to lower him to the floor.  While we were doing this he partly regained consciousness as another staff member called EMS.  He was talking and answering questions when EMS arrived.  They transported him to the hospital.

                                                About 2 weeks (mid January) after the first shot, I started experiencing transient diplopia on awakening in the morning that would resolve in 5 minutes. 2 weeks after the second shot (2/16/21) I started having pain in my left orbit.  I received an MRI brain/orbits on 2/26/21 showing inflammation of my inferior and lateral rectus eye muscles. Labs on 2/26/21 showed normal TSH, free T4, free T3. ANA was positive (without titer). TSI (thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin) was positive at 1.75, 3x the upper limit of labs were normal (0.5). On 3/3/21, I noticed left suborbital swelling and eye restriction on upward gaze. 3/15/21, restriction in upward and lateral gaze. I was diagnosed with thyroid eye disease. I attempted treatment with a methylprednisone dose pack for 6 days on 3/26/21 without improvement. Then a 20 day high dose prednisone (1mg/kg) on 5/8/21 with rapid taper also without symptom improvement. I am starting authorization now for a monoclonal antibody for thyroid eye disease.

I woke up on 05/26/21 at approximately 0120h feeling the need to urinate and was very sweaty, hot and thirsty. I sat down to urinate, and I felt dizzy standing back up. I was feeling very thirsty so proceeded to walk to get some water. I fainted after walking about 10 feet. I regained consciousness, and I drank water and ingested an Advil with the help of my wife. I felt a lot better after drinking the water, but still had a mild throbbing headache. I went back to sleep, and the fever symptoms came and went which affected my sleep quality. I drank more water any time I woke up. I took 2 more Advil as well at one time waking up. I woke up around 1300h on 05/26/21 feeling a lot better and a little more well rested. My fever symptoms are gone, but I am still a little sensitive to cold and feeling a little weak.

                                                First Dose:   I took Moderna COVID19 vaccine and passed out immediately onsite. One of the nurse have to call in ambulance services , they checked ECG and transported me to nearby hospital&#39;s emergency department. Where I received 3-4 hours of emergency treatment ( a bed, re-do ECG, an emergency doctor&#39;s visit and Benadryl I.V. injection). All this life threatening events occured to me because of Moderna COVID19 vaccine. I was very excited and walk on my feet to clinic to take vaccine but I have to go in ambulance and face all this difficulties at the cost of my job day off and all other related inconvenience.    Both ambulatory services and hospital sent a huge bills, which upon my request, they submitted to my health insurance plan. Insurance company paid some amount but not in full. Insurance company said there is no government mandate for insurance companies to pay COVID-19 vaccine related emergiencies. so, they are not liable.     Second Dose:   Despite all this challenges, I decided to go for second dose to protect myself and the people of the from COVID-19. Again the same above story repeated even during the second dose. and they send bills to me.    Now there are close to $3000 bills on me due to above circumstances, which I don&#39;t think appropriate for me to pay. I was simply aiming for safety for myself and other general public by getting myself vaccinated without any prior knowledge of this could cost me financially and dangerous to my own health. I was simply following CDC guideline and suggestion.  In this situation, could you help me financial assistant or request ambulatory services and health to waive my financial obligations? Also, I request you to ask Moderna to reimburse for the cost of adverse effects of their vaccines.

                                                First Moderna Vaccine shot on 3/4/2021- Sore Arm dizziness but only lasted about a day.  Second Moderna Vaccine shot on 4/1/2021- Sore Arm dizziness Fever. The dizziness and fever went away after a day sore are lasted about 5 days.  After that was normal until about 2 1/2 weeks after the shot on 4/20/2021 I went to the hospital due to extreme dizziness,  ears hurt along with eye pressure.   At the hospital they tried to clean out my ears due to some wax which made me even more dizzy which they shot lorazepam into my arm to calm me down.  The was the same arm that got the covid vaccine in it so I wondering if that had any effect on my condition also?  They gave me meclizine to take as needed and told me I should go to an ENT to get checked further.    The doctor then took the wax out with a tool but bruised my ear drum due to this and gave me ofloxacin to clean the blood and said it would heal soon.  Nothing got better so I figured maybe I had some depression and anxiety due to this covid crisis and saw a therapist who prescribed me buspirone which did nothing but give me headaches and hydroxyzine after that to try and see if that was better. Both medicines did nothing and I stopped taking both after about a week.   I ended up going to the hospital two more times on 4/26/2021 and June 20/2021 and they just gave me amoxiciilin in June and said to see the ENT again  I went to the ENT once in April and again in June and asked about ear wax and dizziness. He said you don&#39;t have vertigo and that my ear drum was healed in the June visit

Felt instant dizziness, fatigue, headache, and ear ringing when I stood up. Felt hot at first, then chilled, and continued to switch between hot and cold. These symptoms lasted for about 5 hours with varying levels of severity. My temperature high was 98.3 F according to the infrared forehead thermometer I used throughout the duration of symptoms.

                                                Severe hives and swelling in face/lips appx 3.5 days after getting 1st dose of Covid-19 Moderna Vaccine. Blood test showed that I am suddenly highly allergic to 19 different food groups. I have no known food allergies prior to C19 Moderna Vaccine. I have had hives every single day since they 1st appeared (3.5 days after vaccine). I have had multiple days of facial swelling as well and have been to the hospital multiple times. To this date (date of this report) I still have hives and facial swelling. Facial swelling is intermittent. I have stayed away from the list of foods that I am apparently suddenly allergic to and I still have hives and swelling. I occasionally have a irritated throat which makes it difficult to breathe in. I have a specialist appointment with an allergy/immunology doctor this coming Thursday to see what thier diagnosis is. My family doctor believes my potential angioedema diagnosis is directly related to my 1st dose of C19 Moderna Vaccine.

When I went to the ER I told them about my knee but they didn&#39;t look at it. I am still have a painful swollen knee and a fever. I have been taking ibuprofen for the fever.

While sitting down his eye rolled back and he passed out.  His spouse said his body was shaking.  She lowered him to the floor and he awoke.  Paramedics were called and determined his blood pressure was very low. They tried to stand the patient up to take another blood pressure reading, but the patient had to sit down as he became dizzy and lightheaded again.  The paramedics took him to the ER where the doctor said he was fine and discharged him.

                                                My vision became burry and I was unable to see what I was looking directly at- similar to if I had been looking directly at a bright light source for several seconds- This lasted for approximately 5 minutes. After 5 minutes this went away, but my left-most vision (extreme left of my field of view) began getting blurry and having the kaleidoscope effect- This lasted for approximately 15 minutes, and then subsided. Since these two vision anomalies, I have intermittently had a dull ache in my right hemisphere of my head. This ache will just come in a flash for a second or two, and then won&#39;t happen again for hours.

                                                Felt a bit odd on the couch, little shiver and what felt like adrenaline. I got up and went into the bathroom where the incident occurred. I used to be on 10mg of Ramipril years ago and moved to 5 due to light headedness when standing up. Yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly. Getting up too fast with heart pressure meds prescribed for albumin /T1D and not for heart pressure. The secondary use of Ramipril is normal for type 1 diabetes after 20&#43; years. So I went to 5mg and haven?t had that issue since. I should also mention that when this used to happen to me I would lay down and recover with no problem.  Back to the incident it felt exactly like that but on steroids. I was in the bathroom looking for Tylenol and I got light headed, yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly, ringing in the ears, dizzy, and confused. I remember thinking I should probably get down on the tile floor and lay down like I?m used to from the episodes years ago with 10mg Ramipril causing the same symptoms but never anything so extreme. Next thing I know I?m on the ground waking up where I fainted and hit my head pretty hard on the way down. I probably have a minor concussion. Iced my head in the back where I hit it last night and this morning. Surprisingly 0 bumps, etc other than a little bit sore.  Trying to remember going down is impossible. There is a strange, I guess it?s not strange as I fainted, but to me being 1 moment thinking what I should do then the next moment still thinking that same exact thing but coming to on the bathroom floor with parents yelling over top of me as I was at their house is strange. I recall what almost felt like a dream while I was out but I was wondering why everyone was asking if I was ok, of course I?m ok I thought. Then I realized what happened and crawled around on the floor the rest of the night if I needed anything and was checked every hour through the night which was horrible but necessary.  Also my blood glucose was a 220 at the time of the incident according to my CGM so it didn?t have to do with low blood sugar.  In any case I feel better today but in a fog with a slight headache.

Patient was guided to the floor by pharmacist and significant other and regained consciousness after just a few moments.  Patient was unaware of what happened. Patient was given water and remained lying on the floor for a few minutes and then was able to sit up and recover.

Talked with the patient and he was not very responsive then went unconscious where he was kept him from hitting the ground. I grabbed the patient to prevent them from falling, his eyes appeared to roll slightly and his leg twitched. He was unconscious  and unresponsive for approximately 10 seconds or less while making some grunts/groans. He came to consciousness and sat upright and began drinking water. He says he remembers immediately before but couldn&#39;t remember the exact event. The ambulance was called at initial event and arrived and took him at that point to continue checking on him. Blood pressure was approximately 117/76 with a pulse of 55 form blood pressure cuff over his shirt.

By the evening, I felt sicker than I ever have in my entire life. I was shaking uncontrollably, had a fever, extreme chills, and a pounding headache and muscle aches. I didn&#39;t sleep that night and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until noon the next day. I am still lethargic today and seemed to have lost my sense of smell.   My Covid-19 symptoms from the 2 weeks prior were extremely mild and the vaccine experience was 1,000x worse. Something isn&#39;t right and I am questioning whether I should get the second shot.

                                                Received my shot, talked with the nurse for about a minute or two afterwards in the back and she informed me that i needed to wait 10-15 minutes before i left. i go to the waiting room and set my alarm for 10 minutes. i texted my mother i was done and leaving  to go back home soon and that my second appt was on May 11. she texted back, i responded once again that i will call her when i get home in just over an hour.  Since i had no idea what to expect if something &#34;did go wrong&#34;, i picked up my packet of information i received prior to my shot and started browsing through. i saw the possible serious side effects column and started to go through the list. At the time, about 5-6 mins now afterwards of my shot, i had no difficulty breathing, i did have a little tingling in my tongue, i read &#34;a fast heartbeat&#34;, and put my hand on my chest and asked myself, IS MY HEART GOING FASTER? i looked at the paper again and put my hand back on my chest, and that was the last thing i remember until i was brought back to conscious by the nurses and doctors. i was told the guy in the waiting room ran after i passed out. when i came back to they walked me into the back, i was dizzy and profusively sweating and was drenched from head to toe , shirt and pants were SOAKED in sweat, they took my vitals for the next 40 minutes (3 or 4 times) i dont remember it too clearly until i started coming back to. Blood pressure was up and down and i was white as a ghost, they gave me fluids and i hung out until i felt superbly better about 40 minutes later. Then on my drive home, i had to pull over again, because i was getting light headed and felt like i was going to vomit. made it home, 90 minutes later, took a baby aspirin and slept the rest of the afternoon for about 5/6 hours before waking back up to eat some dinner.

He was immediately pulled into a private exam room. Vitals were stable at that time. 50 mg of IM Benadryl was administered. Patient did not improve with this treatment and went on to develop a muffled sounding voice and mild swelling of his left posterior tongue 10 minutes later. At this point, 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered.  Symptoms rapidly improved with treatment. EMS was contacted for transfer to the ER for further treatment as indicated and close observation.

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine after review. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine they came to the drop off area stating that they felt warm and the lights seemed brighter. They explained they didn&#39;t know if it was just a random feeling or a reaction to the vaccine. I had them sit down, gave them an ice pak and cold bottled water, advised that they stay longer (around 30 minutes total) After about 10 minutes the patient felt better but they stayed the wait time. I called to check on them in the afternoon but they did not answer

                                                I have had COVID-19 about 2 months before I got the vaccine. There were some lingering effects like tiredness and loss of teste and smell that were improving. About a week and a half after getting the vaccine I noticed that items started to smell like fish or burned.  Symptoms described as parosmia. I can not be sure if this was caused by the vaccine, but it did start after I had the vaccine.

Hours later the tingling in my face was still there a stronger. My face around my mouth felt numb. Not sure if lips were a little swollen or just numb. My face also felt dried out. The next morning i woke up and numbness and tingling have gone away. My face still feels dried out.

My eyes look inflamed almost and I?ve been using basic Visine to make it better and it does make it go away for a little bit but the redness has been coming back. It could be an eye infection but again I take good care of my eyes and contacts and I?m wondering if this is a weird eye allergy side effect from the COVID shot.

                                                pupils underwent myosis for several hours after the injection before returning to normal dialation rates. (not sure if this was a side effect or just a shock response to foreign matterials entering the body)  localized soreness in arm for a few days. worse second day than first.  chemical taste in mouth resembling isopropyl alcohol for about an hour or so, starting about 30 minutes after recieving vaccine, i assume this was just some of the sterilizing agent entering the body and getting circulated.  mild head fog in the days following the shot, this seems to have mostly gone away and i cant say with certainty if it is a side effect or was caused by some other factor such as stress.  mood disturbance / depression starting the day of the shot, this one might be completely unrelated, I attended a funeral of a family friend on that day which seems a reasonably likely cause for such, im just listing it because I want to be concise with my reporting of what Ive been experiencing.  mild headache behind the temple on the right side of my head, and behind both eyes.  heightened reaction to concrete allergy, not sure what exactly in concrete/cement i am allegric too possible nickel or chromates as pomphlox seems to fit the description, this has been recurrent for years but after recieving the vaccine a ring of hives formed on my left hand and my feet were the most broken out theyve ever been, i worked with cement 1 day after recieving the shot.  a relatively consistent feeling of coldness, since getting the shot ive felt abnormally cold, sometimes feeling the need for wearing a coat in 80&#43; degree weather. this is completely abnormal, typically i could wear a tshirt in 50°F weather and a hooded sweatshirt would suffice down into the 20s.  persistent joint pain in almost every joint of my body and the surrounding muscles, feels like it may be in the cartilidge or connective tissue, occasional pains had been experienced before and considered a normal part of life, but this has been relatively constant like an inflammatory response.  sleep cycle disturbance, normally i had abnormal sleeping habbits where being awake for 24&#43; hours at a time wasnt particularly uncommon (oddly this one seemingly gets worse when i stop drinking caffinated drinks), and it was impossible for me to get to sleep prior to like 2-3 am most nights followed by  sleeping for around 4-10 hours a night on average. however since recieving the shot ive been sleeping a lot more than this and at strange times (for me) like the middle of the afternoon.  fever/constant headache on the side the injection was recieved on has set in after about 2weeks and has been terrible, ive had to take ibuprophen for two days just to function, mild visual hallucinations have also occured in the past couple days mostly spatial distortions where the depth perception isnt working properly, and framerate issues where objects in motion leave a trail momentarily.

                                                Within 30 minutes I felt confused and light headed and it reminded me of feeling like I had a concussion. I had dark spots in my vision and intense pressure in my head. As I had been told to expect random side effects I went home and went to sleep early. The next day I had a lack of motor function with continued intracranial pressure and confusion. I called my doctor and went to the Emergency Room where my Blood Pressure was recorded to be Hypertensive and then retaken. I was given a CT scan and sent home. I was unable to work  the rest of the week and was out of work after being sent home sick the following week. I continued to experience intense intracranial pressure and an inability to form short term memories for three weeks after vaccination. I still continue to experience intracranial pressure and episodes of hypertension but have more ease in forming short term memories. Intracranial pressure has nonetheless decreased significantly compared to the immediate onset following inoculation. My medical testing is ongoing.

After I injected the vaccine, patient stated he had blurry vision after the first dose of vaccine and still has blurry vision. Since he told me this side effect after the vaccine administration, I instructed him to tell his doctor as soon as possible. He said he can only see his doctor later July for an appointment. I told him to call his doctor and talk to him over the phone about the side effect and treatment options in addition to seeing the doctor as soon as possible for the soonest available appointment.

This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

                                                Developed iritis form of uveitis shortly after getting vaccine. Felt feverish and very fatigued and sore the day after the vaccine (3/19/21), which was unexpected as I am generally healthy and do not recall having an adverse reaction to a vaccine before. Noticed prominent symptoms of iritis by around 2/22/21, but they may have been occurring earlier as I did not know what was happening to me. Symptoms started off as occasional aching of my right eye, but it eventually got inflamed and extra sensitive to light, and I experienced worse redness and aching/pain and photosensitivity by 2/26/21 when I scheduled an appointment with an optometrist. Pain/sensitivity was intermittent from 2/26/21 to  3/1/21, but redness remained. On 3/1/21, my optometrist tentatively diagnosed me with mild iritis and referred me to an opthalmologist. On 3/1/21, an opthalmologist diagnosed me with iritis/anterior uveitis, and I began a treatment of prednisolone acetate 1% drops. thought my development of iritis may have been related to me getting my first dose of the Covid-19 Moderna vaccine shortly before getting symptoms. Hoping to recover within  a few weeks. Have a follow-up appointment scheduled for 3/10/21.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

                                                2 days after receiving my first dose my tongue began to feel tingly and swell, I could feel the tightness in the back and in my lymph nodes as well. I began to have sensitivity to spicy foods on Thursday. On Friday I woke up and my words were slurring as my tongue felt more swollen  and I started to notice some slight swelling in my throat, maybe 5%. I started gargling diphenhydramine on Friday night and that helped a lot, I also took loratadine and Fexofenadine. By Sunday my symptoms were masked by the allergy drugs and I stopped taking the diphenhydramine. 1 week later, 12 days post Moderna Vaccinne I stopped taking the fexofenadine and Loratadine. I continued to have tongue irritation and a sore on my tongue for 2.5 weeks. I then had an adverse event after the 2nd shot as well.

I felt this decrease but was still present 25 minutes after the shot, I notified a rep at the nurses tent. They asked some questions and said they could take me into the tent but that if I felt it was improving to just wait 15 more minutes, I did that and left after. I continued to have some tongue swelling the next day and continued taking all 3 antihistamines for maybe 3 days. I previously had sensitivity to spicy foods and my tongue feeling inflamed but not swollen from the previous shot, this again occurred the 2nd time. I maintained this with gradual dissipation of symptoms until about 3/1/21. I believe all my symptoms were resolved at that point.

                                                Deafness in the right ear; Ear ringing; Numbness on the ears; A spontaneous report  was received from a 33-year-old male consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced numbness in ears/hypoesthesia, ears ringing /tinnitus, and deafness in right ear/deafness unilateral.  The patient has no known medical history. No relevant concomitant medications were taken during vaccination.    On unknown date, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: if reported or unknown) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The patient did not experience any adverse events after the first dose.  On 13 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 001B21A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13 Mar 2021, 45 minutes after the second dose, the patient experienced ringing in ears and 2 hours later numbness in ears. Approximately 3 hours after vaccination, the patient experienced deafness in his right ear, which was considered as medically significant event. The event deafness persisted, and the patient went to emergency room for consultation.   The patient was treated with prednisone for the events.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events ringing in ears and numbness in ears were considered as unknown. The outcome of the event deafness in his right ear was considered as not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On March 18, 2021 the patient started experiencing right-sided tongue numbness and loss of taste. It progressed to his face tingling and feeling sore. This went on for a week or so and progressed to absolute right-sided face numbness and face droop from forehead to neck.  Patient&#39;s mother is a registered nurse and conducted a full stroke assessment on him with no findings indicating stroke at all.  Patient saw his dentist between the time symptoms started and the full face droop happened thinking maybe he had something going on in his mouth and the dentist didn&#39;t find any issues, even with an x-ray. The patient went and saw a physician and was prescribed antibiotics in case he had an abscess that wasn&#39;t seen on the x-ray because everything was tingling, numb, or hurting in his mouth at this point. When the right-sided face droop happened, he went back to the physician and was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy.

I continued to speak to him and he was unable to hear initially.  He did cry out and gasp and tighten then started to have a few slow jerky movements bringing both arms and body up from the chair. It appeared as if he may vomit and I repositioned to ensure he would not slide off of the chair.  The movements lasted about a minute and then he started to come to.  He described feeling dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, and sweaty.  During the event his pupils were non responsive. At 11:17 he went pale and started feeling as if he was spinning and experiencing tingling.  He was still reclined in the chair and sitting up aided with the tingling.  He was given a cold pack to help regulate and given ice water at 11:18.  He stated he had not eaten yet today as he usually doesn&#39;t eat until 11. His temperature had dropped to 96.1 vs 97.5 prior to the vaccination.  BP was checked at 11:25 and was 120/72 which is lower than usual for him and to be expected with the LOC.  After drinking his water, I had him attempt to stand while grasping the wall/table for 2 minutes to assess his steadiness, then standing unassisted for 2 minutes.  After he felt steady enough we had him walk 10-15 feet and stand for another 2 minutes.  Patient was feeling tired and instructed not to drive home.  The situation was conveyed to his wife and they were instructed to seek ER/Urgent care if any of his symptoms reappeared. They stayed in the area to eat lunch and I checked in again at 12:12pm with the patient and he is feeling better after eating but still tired.  I also recommended following up with his primary as I will be sending her a copy of this report.

                                                I received my first COVID19 vaccination injection on March 30th, 2021. Four days later, on April 4th, I noticed that I had developed moderate bilateral tinnitus and it has persisted up to the time of this submission (April 13th, 2021). The intensity of the tinnitus has not wavered much, nor has the nature of the tinnitus in general. Occasionally, there have been additional phantom sounds heard, like a quiet fan-like wooshing, but ringing has been the overall dominant effect. Reading up what I could online, I have done what I can to mitigate the effects, but I have yet to experience any relief.

                                                Patient received first dose of COVID vaccine at 1:10pm without issue. During his 15 minute waiting period post vaccination, at approx 1:15pm, patient experienced a syncopal event, &#43; for striking his head. He never lost vitals, and promptly woke up. at 1:22pm, his vitals were initially BP 90/42, HR 45, pulse ox 100% on room air, and RR 16. He complained of dizziness and blurred vision, but was AOX3 with all cranial nerves intact. 911 was called for patient to be assessed. Vitals were then checked again at 1:29 pm, BP 110/62, HR 62, pulse ox 100%, RR 16.  At this time, all of patient&#39;s symptoms had resolved. EMS arrived at 1:39pm and checked his BS which was 114. At this point patient no longer wanted to go to ER. EMS spoke with on call provider who gave verbal okey for patient to no go to the ER, but gave strict ER precautions such as headaches, vomitting, vision changes, etc. Patient was able to teach back. Patient reports that this (passing out) frequently occurs to him anytime he has to get shots or blood work done and he has seeked medical attention afterwards before with no resolution. Patient left at 1:46pm. He walked home.

Almost lost consciousness. First to subside was the dizziness and loss of peripheral vision, muffled hearing after, tinnitus subsided around the same time of the body sweats. Only lasted 5 minutes, but was followed by a less extreme version of all the same symptoms an hour to two hours later. No episodes since.

                                                Patient received dose and was in observation area for about 4 or 5 minutes when I noticed he looked very out of it and his head was wobbling. When I tried to speak with him he wasn&#39;t answering. I then ran to his side and by the time I was there he had passed out (eyes were open and rolling to the back of his head and he was not responsive). I told my technician to call 911 and went to grab the epinephrine and emergency kit while a customer stayed next to him. He came to within a minute and I did not need to administer epinephrine, etc. He said he was okay but we called EMS, who then took over and patient decided to go with them to ambulance/ER.

There is no evidence of retinal detachment by ultrasound. CT CTA did not reveal any evidence of carotid artery disease. COVID-19 status positive on 7/12/21. Patient is admitted to the inpatient unit with neurology consult. Neurology assessment: description sounds highly consistent with amaurosis fugax, and in the setting of known extensive cardiac history and possible hypercoagulability in the setting of positive COVID, would be concerned for an embolic event. Positive COVID despite getting Moderna vaccine x2. No respiratory symptoms, but concern for possible hypercoagulability event (embolic TIA causing some transient right eye vision loss). Patient is still admitted as of 7/12/21 with additional tests being performed.

                                                I recieved the moderna covid vaccine.  I ate a few things that just tasted a little off.  I thought the product may have just been bad.  For instance, a few candies in a pack had a bitter aftertaste.  Tortilla chips and corn chips had an off aftertaste.  It is generally subtle for most items but certain things are more noticable.  I asked others if the things that tasted different to me tasted different to them and they said it tasted normal.  This has continued for about 3 weeks at this point.  Last year I had a presumed case of covid where I completely lost taste and smell for 10 days.  This is very different in that I can still taste, it just seems that my taste buds have changed and it is persistent thus far.

I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

                                                I had COVID-19 and tested positive on December 23rd, 2020. I had a loss of taste and smell. It was not a complete loss.  More like an 80% loss. I received my first COVID vaccine dose on 01/08/2021. By about mid January, however, I had almost all, if not all, of my taste/smell back. But after my second Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine dose, I lost my sense of taste and smell again. When I was at about 90-100% recovered, as of the 2 or 3 days following my 2md vaccine dose, I had lost almost all taste and smell again. As of today, 4 days after the vaccine, I&#39;m back to around 80% again. I have not had any other congestion, etc. that might explain my loss of taste and smell.

                                                Delayed reaction to the vaccine that began 6 days after first dose and persisted for approximately 3 days. I first became itchy on my abdomen and arms, I then developed flat oval hives and my eyes and upper lip began swelling. My throat did not swell. I took 2 Benadryl that evening that helped the itch and caused the facial swelling to subside somewhat. I slept thru the night and when the Benadryl wore off in the morning, the same symptoms returned. I took 1 Benadryl which again calmed the symptoms. The same symptoms returned in the evening and I went to an Urgent Care. I was prescribed Prednisone and more Benadryl. These medicines helped to calm the symptoms even more, but the itchiness and hives did come and go thru the next day. On day 3 I took Zyrtec in addition to my last dose of Predisone and the itchiness subsided completely. I took one more dose of Zyrtec the next day and the symptoms have not returned. I followed up with my PCM who tested for a Hazelnut allergy as I had eaten them that first night. She also referred me to an Allergist. I saw the Allergist who said in their opinion my immune system was having a reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and classified me as &#34;medium risk&#34; for the second dose. He recommended that I still get the second dose and to premeditate with Zyrtec the night before, day of and for 7 days following.

Finished a conversation at left the facility after approximately 9:55am. While driving back to office (appx 5 minute drive total), experienced clammy skin, sweating at 3 minutes into drive.  I considered pulling over, though I knew I should be around people where I could be monitored, so continued on. Experienced elevated temperature, blurriness of vision and my vision began to turn bright and white.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I thought I may be passing out.  I got out of the vehicle, sat down on the nearest bench and asked two individuals who where outside to stay with me, and I explained my symptoms to them.  I remained seated for approximately 10 minutes, and when I felt the symptoms subside, went into my office and am now filing this report.

Also started developing tingling, pins and needles sensations, numbness and weakness in left leg, foot, forearm and hand. Have experienced prolonged periods of time with muscle spasms in left calf sometimes up to 2 days in length.  A combination of all of these symptoms happen daily. Have had muscle fatigue in right arm and neck at different times Have developed a metallic taste in mouth over the last 2 weeks. After the first 5 days developed extreme mental fatigue and grogginess that lasted 7 days and can sometimes reappear.

Most of these effects passed after about 30 hours. I woke up this morning with a headache and my left eye really hurts. I have a subconjunctival hemorrhage in my left eye that fills about 1/3rd of the eye white with blood..... Headache, stiff muscles and overall tiredness are the only other remaining side effects besides a blood-filled eyeball at this point.

Chills but with a high fever. Threw up 25mins after shot. Immediately after that felt really nauseous and couldn?t see straight. Vision was black and I was seeing stars. Felt like hallucinating really bad. Couldn?t focus my vision. Got home and showered with a really hot shower and immediately started feeling better. 45mins to 1 hour after shot started feeling way better! Just sluggish the rest of the night.  For some reason was fighting going to sleep and fell asleep sitting up. Next day much better!

Coughing also took place.  No rash was present and nothing present at the injection site.  Allergy symptoms subsided over the next few hours as a result of Zyrtec being taken. Swelling of eyes remained until the next day after the event.

This continued to get progressively worse until full left-sided facial paralysis and diagnosis of Bell&#39;s palsy on 4/8. Began a 7-day course of prednisone and valacyclovir on 4/8. The onset of symptoms was accompanied by neck pain for a few days prior. To date, there has been some improvement but not back to normal yet. No prior medical history of Bell&#39;s palsy or any other facial paralysis.

No treatment other than OTC pain meds/NSAIDs, seems to have passed at this point.  Uncertain if related to the vaccine or not; I do have tooth issues but I have not had pain of that sort before. I have been advised to report it regardless so I am.

I searched for it online and looks like the medical term for it is Tinnitus, Also, There was one occasion that I started to hear my blood flow in my ear for a couple of minutes. The bell while yawning hasn&#39;t gone away after about 2 weeks. Luckily I don&#39;t hear the sound when I am not yawning which is a blessing.

He all of a sudden was thirsty and told mom to grab water and when she was getting the water he became dizzy and fell on the floor from the chair. He injured his right side of lip where it was bleeding. He was then given water and was fine but was still feeling little dizzy. Manager called 911 and after paramedic came he was taken to the hospital. Paramedic checked the glucose level which was normal and the BP was 91/50.

I went to be around 11pm.  Upon laying down I began to get dizzy and my heart began to pound rapidly.  This strong heart pounding would last 5 hours straight. An hour later my throat started to get a tight feeling with tingling under the chin area and my saliva production began to slow drying out my mouth.  Breathing became more labored and difficult.  At this time my heart was still beating strong.  I had intense Insomnia.  The one time that I tried to lay down; when my body would try to doze off for a second; my body would suddenly jolt me awake with an intense shaking and heart pounding.

                                                I am a healthy individual with no pre-existing conditions. I had Covid-19 in August of 2020. I was in bed for 5 weeks with most of the symptoms and regularly had fever exceeding 104. When I was allowed to return to work, the Dr. gave me light duty orders to not exceed 5 hours worked per day for 2 months.  After receiving the first vaccination dose, my arm became incredibly sore. These symptoms lasted for almost 2 weeks.   The morning following vaccination, my body began to ache and hurt on touch to the point where the cover woke me up in pain. These symptoms lasted nearly three days during both day and night.   I became nauseous about 24 hours following the vaccination. These symptoms lasted almost 4, 24 hour days.   I became dizzy, periodically, about 24 hours after receiving the vaccination.  These symptoms lasted for almost 7 days.   I had low grade fever on three occasions that I knew about, I treated with Tylenol.  These symptoms lasted 3 days after vaccination.   I had a horrible headache (I never have had headaches before) I could not open my eyes or expose them to light. Most of the pain was concentrated on the left side of my head. These headaches started 3 days after receiving the vaccination and lasted 5 days later until day 8. I used Tylenol, which seemed to have little effect and slept all day.

He stated he does not have a fever but he has body aches and his eyes burn. The burning of the eyes doesn&#39;t last long but it happens a few times throughout the day. I suggested that when the time came to get his second dose that he should see how he is feeling and let us know to discuss it before administering and that if he doesn&#39;t feel better in a few days to make an appointment with his doctor.

Patient appeared pale, and his head was nodding backward. 911 was called. I checked his pulse, and breathing which were both normal. Patient started to gradually lose consciousness and confused speech, but was roused by me asking him questions, to which he responded and shaking his shoulder. Patient gradually began to regain color and normal speech returned. Patient stated that he was panicked and is afraid of needles and worked him self up after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                Saturday afternoon (2 days after dose) I broke out in extremely bad hives all over my back, face and head. I called ER to see what I should do because this has never happened before. I&#39;ve never had any allergic reaction to anything and I was concerned since I just received my 2nd dose. ER recommended I come in, since nothing in my normal life changed to cause this also because my lips were getting swollen and throat was scratchy. Once I was checked out in ER they gave me an IV with another antihistamine to get in my system faster. I was releases later that night with a script for prednisone (2 pills for 3 days). Everything was fine Sunday however, i woke up Monday with the rash and hives coming back. I then made another appointment with a Dr, who prescribed more prednisone. Hives have since been gone and not returned.

A few minutes later he tells me he is dizzy and his vision is blurry so I bring him back into the vaccination room, give him some water and tell him to relax. 10 minutes later I check his BP which is elevated along with his pulse. I check again another 10 minutes later and it has lowered (pulse 80). BP still elevated so I mentioned it could be due to the nervousness to the reaction or just that he has hypertension and he should get it checked out. After a while his spouse came into the vaccination room and he said he was better and they left.

                                                I was working on a fence about 5-5:30 pm and suddenly developed blurry vision. I continued working for another 5-10 minutes, then I went inside for dinner with my wife kids and in-laws. I complained I couldn?t see in my periphial  to my wife and mother n law.  I  ate dinner, salad and spaghetti. While eating my brother in law asked if I got a new car and that he hadn?t see the white one before. I tried to tell him what happened to my old car but got caught and couldn?t think clearly about the old car, the problems it had and the story.  After dinner I want out to help on the fence again and my son was handing  my brother in law boards and I tried to tell him the board wasn?t cut with a bevel yet. But couldn?t come up with any words to describe the board. I went to my wife explained my  that my brain wasn?t working right and I clearly had a problem. I developed some tingling in my right hand. She took me to  local ER referenced. My symptoms subsided on their own and they weren?t able to see anything on a cat scan. As I felt better I didn?t take the next step to the larger ER with and MRI.

                                                Horrible ear infection started a few days after receiving vaccination. I was lethargic 2 days after vaccination, then woke up with the worst ear pain I?ve ever had. I could not sleep and NyQuil would only help for 1 hour. I went to the Urgent Care at 8am and was diagnosed with a bad ear infection. I was prescribed Amoxicillin and was given a shot of Tramadol which quickly helped the pain. I haven?t had an ear infection in 20 years and it is uncommon for adults to get them. I thought it would be important for you to track whether this is happening to other people and if anything could be done to prevent it.

Prior to vaccination I was having mild ringing in my right ear due to moderate hearing loss caused by ear drum perforation.  2 days after vaccination I started having tinnitus on left side of my brain on and off and now it&#39;s continuous , also ringing in my right ear has increased , it is causing to me to have sleepless nights and groggy days. It has not improved even after a month. It could be  a permanent damage but I am not sure.

                                                at around noon the day following my shot, I started feeling soreness all over my body. I took aleve. I felt some chills and a slight headache. These lasted until Sunday. Monday I started feeling very tired, very week, and still sore in my arms and a little in my legs. I took aleeve. Tuesday I still felt lingering soreness but no headache. I started feeling anxiety towards the end of my workday. At around 4pm I started to feel my legs quivering as if I had just run several miles and my muscles were week. This gave me anxiety as I was still working and assisting clients. at around 4:15 I started feeling like I was going to break out in hives around my neck area, which does sometimes happen to me. I got home and around 7pm I took a Zyrtec, but by that point hives started forming on my neck and head. I felt my lip start to swell. I woke up at about 3am on Wednesday to find both of my lips swollen and I took a Benadryl and went back to bed. I woke up at about 7am and my eyes were both swollen almost completely shut and my lips were swollen. I could feel itchiness from incoming hives around my neck and shoulders. I took two Benadryl and rested all day. The swelling mostly went down by the end of the day and I continued to nurse the Benadryl. I saw my doctor on the 15th.

                                                Continuing peripheral neuropathy. On 4/21 I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm and within two minutes had a vasovagal reaction?tingling in my underarm, flush feeling face and stiffness and tingling in my upper lips.  That mostly subsided within 30 minutes as the dull arm pain set in.  Over the next 7 days my arm pain intensified some and moved up my shoulder and down my triceps and into my elbow. 4/28 I awoke with numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle finger of my shot (right) arm in addition to the arm pain and neck and shoulder muscle tightness. 5/8 Arm pain and finger numbness still present, I did some yard work that exacerbated the arm pain, and at this point it was the first day I recognized the pain as a specific intense nerve pain from my shoulder, down my triceps, across my forearm and into my pointer and middle fingers. From this point on the nerve pain and finger numbness/tingling persisted and included intermittent cold forearm/fingers. 5/11 Met with my primary physician who diagnosed me with cervical radiculopathy (C7). Prescribed physical therapy, prednisone and flexeril. 5/12 Had a massage w/aroma therapy, cryotherapy, and cupping. Provided some relaxation, but no change in nerve pain or symptoms. 5/14 First day of PT; neck and arms stretches, neck traction and nerve glides 5/17 Completed Medrol dose pack, steroids seemingly had no effect. Flexeril at night helped relax neck and shoulder muscles a bit. 5/20 (Today) Still have numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle fingers with specific nerve pain down my triceps, elbow, across forearm and into my two fingers that intensifies with activity and at night.  Intermittent cold sensation in right hand, underarm inflammation and tenderness, and general weakness of right hand and arm.

                                                After five days from the second dose of Moderna Covid Vaccine, I started to have vertigo, dizziness and lightheadedness and pressure on my ears. It is worse when I walk or turn my haead; I am at the day 13 today from the vaccine secon dose, and still have those feelings without any improvement. This has made me unfunctional and unable to walk or do my daily activities. I went to my neurologist 2 days ago and she found nothing wrong with my tests. She finally prescribed otc medication: &#34;meclizine&#34; that has not helped me much. I saw a lot of people are experiencing the same issue, dizziness and vertigo ;Please see thsi forum which shows I am not the only one. /

Lasted approximately 1.5 weeks in full force 24-7. Starting to finally taper off now, but still have somewhat heavy head feeling. Lack of balance has not been an issue the past 3 days.

                                                No side effects from first shot.  Second shot was different.  Got my second shot about 2PM and around 1-2 AM I was getting ready for bed.  At first I was just feeling tired but then I started shaking uncontrollably and muscles in my neck and back were spazzing out.  I lost all control of my body and fell over, convulsing for an unknown amount of time.  I apparently foamed and/or drooled all over myself.  I woke out of this effect around 3:30 AM.  This was Friday/Saturday.  Its Monday now.  I still cannot stand straight and cannot create complex thoughts in my mind.  I had a hard time perceiving colors for the first day and a half to two days after the seizure or stroke I suffered.  I still have a migraine that feels like an elephant is sitting inside my skull.  I still cannot perform complicated thoughts nor can I do complicated things with my hands because of a lack of motor skills.  I successfully pulled every muscle in my back and neck and cannot stand upright.  I&#39;m 35 and now need a cane.  Its already been 3 days and things really have not changed.  Won&#39;t catch me lining up for a booster shot.  NO THANK YOU.  I did not seek medical attention because lets face it the healthcare system is a joke I would have needed a ride to a hospital, increasing my odds of getting the virus, to have them hold me as long as they can to stab me and poke me and take samples, give me no results, and a humungo bill.  I will die before I go to a hospital ever again because the amounts of testing I required at the time would have covered back and neck and brain scans of various types and those tests are stupid expensive and 99% of the time I&#39;ve ever got one they said oh I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong go see my friend who is a specialist blah blah blah and its the &#34;doctor-go-round&#34; where you blow all your money on morons that only care about lining their pockets.

                                                Three weeks after receiving the first dose (on 02/01/2021) I woke up with extreme dizziness and imbalance, I felt as if I was constantly leaning to the right.  I would get extremely nauseous from walking, working, or just sitting and turning my head.  When I would lay down on my right side I felt as if fluid were building up and that something was going to pop.  Advil, caffeine, and alcohol made my symptoms worse.  I was able to find some relief by laying down on my left side and through sleep.   After a week, I went to see Dr. at Clinic. They were unable to figure my issue, but they ruled out BPPV.  They also did a blood and urine test at this time. After two weeks the dizziness started to fade a little, but I was left with headaches, imbalance, tiredness, and pressure behind my ear and eye.  I noticed that any kind of stress or anger would make the symptoms much worse.  I visited Dr. at ENT Clinic.  She did several tests and was unable to find any obvious cases of my symptoms.  She suggested I might have had migraines, even though I had no history of them.  She told me to give it a month and come back if I was still having problems. After one Month the dizziness was pretty much gone, but I still was experiencing imbalance, headaches, and pressure.  Instead of getting dizzy I would get sharp shooting headaches that would last a couple of seconds.  I still had what felt like pressure behind my eye and ear.  I also still was unable to lay on my right side.  I visited ENT Dr. again and we decided to do an MRI with contrast.  The MRI came back negative.  We decided to start me on vestibular physical therapy. After 3 months I have gotten to the point where I do not feel imbalance every day.  I still will have days where I feel like I am leaning to the right, but those are getting less frequent.  I still occasionally get headaches, tightness, and fullness in the area.  I would say I am about 75 percent better. I feel what happened in my head is somehow the same reaction I had in my left arm.  I reported this reaction in a different report.  I would like to point out that both times these reactions occurred I drank alcohol the night before.

I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

                                                About 10 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, hives developed on the backs of both of my hands and around my right eye. The hives persisted for 6 days (I took Benadryl to stop the itching). After 6 days of hives I went to a walk-in clinic and they prescribed 5 days of Prednasone. Today I am on my 4th day of the Prednasone and the hives are finally starting to clear up.

                                                The evening of the vaccine it started with severe fatigue and a sore throat. The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

                                                The night of the injection started with severe fatigue and a severe sore throat, the next day I woke up with a sore throat so bad I could not swallow. I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

                                                One day after vaccination I woke up with mild anaphylactic symptoms in my mouth, some swelling in my lower lip. However two days after, I woke up with my lower lip with extreme anaphylactic swelling. I did not go to the ER, but was close. It subsided after about 4 hours. I am not certain that it was related to the COVID vaccination, but the timing, severity, and rarity of the symptoms led me to make this report.

He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

Developed ringing in both ears. This has persisted for 3 weeks now and is continuing. Saw a doctor on demand and she diagnosed me with tinnitus and referred me to see an ENT. Saw ENT listed in form and the diagnosed me with the same.  Ringing of the ears are constant and not gone away.

                                                Within one minute of receiving the shot I felt disoriented and had trouble determining if I had buttoned my shirt correctly. For the next two and half hours I had trouble recalling basic things that I should have been observing such as which highway my driver had taken me home on although I knew where I was at.   I also experienced irregular breathing. To be specific, I would take a very large breath, a very short breath, or miss a breath. This started as a series of one to three irregular breaths every five minutes or so. My breaths became more irregular in the next hour. While driving to my employers office about fifteen or twenty minutes after my shot, my right eye closed and I could not open it for about seven seconds. My breathing also became deep and the pace was not under my control. Once at the office I sat in my manager&#39;s office to be observed. I experienced more intense episodes of the above listed symptoms such as both eyes closing and the left one watering. The watering continued into the next day periodically. At least two times while my eyes closed I had to put my elbow on the desk and my hand on my head to make sure I didn&#39;t fall out of the chair. I also felt very uncomfortable causing me to moan. This happened one time.   After this my manager called my parents and they came to take me home. It took them one hour to get there. While waiting I felt light headed and the breathing irregularities became less intense. When they got there I mainly felt disoriented. The disorientation could be best described as slightly impaired or slowed decision making.   I would also like to know if I should receive the second vaccination.

Certain things have a very distinct smell and matching taste. Most are liquids. For example Coke and Gatorade smell and taste exactly the same and it?s a terrible taste. Shampoo, tooth paste the same. Foods have recently started to taste the similar, there has been no improvement since it came on.

I had to lay down for about 5 minutes before I started feeling any sort of normal.  Just about everyday since the Shot I have had a a high pitched ringing that comes and goes and a sever migraine that does not change if I take any medication (Advil). the only way to feel better is to sleep. yesterday was the worst yet.  when I contacted my pharmacist that administered the vaccine they informed me that they did not report my initial side effects and only after I called today were they going to report them.

The patient began getting lightheaded and hot, his color went out of him and his eyes began rolling back in his head.  His eyelids turned a purple color and he appeared to momentarily stop breathing.  Myself and another pharmacist got him on the ground and supported his head with a coat.  When he &#34;came to&#34; and was talking to us.  He described feeling better on the cold floor and his color began coming back.   I was speaking with him the entire time.  While we were out with his 9-1-1 was called and paramedics arrived 15 min later.  by the time paramedics had arrived the patient had gotten up and back into the chair himself, was lucid and had color back in his face.  Paramedics arrived and took over.  He was given the green light from them and remained in the pharmacy area for a total of about 30 minutes before heading home. The patient was admittedly nervous for the shot and had not eaten or had anything to drink the whole day to that point. I believe he passed out from a variety of factors not related to the actual ingredients in the vaccine but cannot confirm this.

                                                Rumbling and what seems like pressure in left ear. Varying levels of discomfort. It becomes very difficult to concentrate on everyday tasks when it begins to increase in  severity. It began almost 3 weeks after I received my first vaccination and is still affecting me today.

                                                I believe I experienced multiple symptoms as a result of my vaccine. My experience matches exactly as described in the article.  ON 4/1/21 at approximately 4pm I awoke from a nap experiencing acute vertigo, nausea and headache. I also was experiencing fever and chills. I began treating with excedrine but did not have an effect. The vertigo was very acute, my eyes were skipping and I was unable to walk. Nause was so intense that any attempt to leave my bed resulted in vomiting. I was unable to eat and could barely drink for the first 24 hours. Friday 4/2 at approx 7pm I took a dose of Promethazine which began to help the nausea. Extreme headache/migraine lasted for 3 days. During this time I also experienced extreme neck pain, as well as pain near base of skull, behind my ears, and on my temples. Symptoms were steadily improving each day, so I did not seek medical care during this time. I feel I became fully recovered by 4/18. I just had my second vaccine dose on 4/21 and I am very nervous about experiencing a relapse of symptoms.

He was then sent to me, who confirmed he does have papilledema (swelling of bilateral optic nerves) worse in the left eye with inferior peripheral visual field defect. He has had extensive workup including labs and MRI of the brain to r/o other etiologies, which were all normal.

                                                First I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to light, I was also feeling light headed and dizzy on my walk back to the car. (about 30 minutes after injection). I had someone else drive because I felt like I could not drive in my condition. On the ride home, about 40 minutes after injection, I began to have an increased heart rate and had a hard time swallowing. It was also slightly difficult to breathe. I felt like my head was cloudy and I had a hard time concentrating. I felt like my brain was responding about a half a second slower to what I saw. Like if I wanted to turn my head, I would think try to turn my head and my body would react a second later. When I got home, about 1 hour after the injection, my girlfriend told me my hands were freezing cold. I was also having a hard time walking in straight because I was so dizzy. I was still having some minor trouble breathing and swallowing. It was difficult to drink water. After about 2 hours my breathing returned to normal. My mind was cloudy all day, I felt like I was drunk.  On the second day, I woke up with an intense headache. It lasted for 3 days. My arm started to hurt on the second day as well, no pain at all the first day. My head was still cloudy and I had difficulty trying to recall memories or answer questions. By the third day this was basically gone. I was extremely tired for three days total. My mind remain cloudy for about a week.

Returned to work and began feeling &#34;tingling and numbness in my legs, pressure in my head, ringing in my ears, my arms got heavy and it was hard to move, I had trouble using the phone so told coworker to get his boss&#34; He stated, &#34;I was slouching in my chair, sliding out of it, and my eyesight was blurry&#34;. Nurse was summoned and laid him flat w/feet elevated. He ate a &#34;few donuts and peanut butter crackers after his shot&#34;. He felt better when lying flat but as soon as he sat up, symptoms returned three times. BP-142/88 initially, then rose to 149/106, Pulse-92 10 min. later. On third attempt to sit up, BP 153/99. Patient says his BP has never been above 128/84 and that he just had his annual physical two weeks prior and it was good. EMTs were called since symptoms kept coming back. BP was 170/100s. Was transported to Hospital. He said they did a &#34;brain test&#34; having him touch his nose w/his finger, slid heels down shins, etc. but no other testing was done.&#34; He was discharged to home around 3PM and was told &#34;he had an anxiety attack&#34;. He said they never really asked him what happened. Later that evening at 9:30PM, symptoms returned and he had to lie down. He had &#34;pressure in his head, ringing in ears, and couldn&#39;t get up.&#34; Wife called EMTs. His vision was blurry. BP 150/110 upon exertion (movement) and 138/103 at rest, Pulse btw 105-110. He refused going back to hospital since they did nothing the 1st time. I spoke with him Monday morning and he had seen his Dr. She put him on a Beta blocker still his BP was still elevated. He still feels &#34;cotton headed, muddled, w/constant ringing in ears.&#34; Did not go to work on Monday. Felt frustrated that ER &#34;blew it off and said it was anxiety, which he said he was not feeling anxious until his symptoms began and would not go away&#34;.

                                                Dizziness, unbalance. Vertigo was there occasionally the first couple days for hours or minutes, continues endlessly for now. I had a case of vertigo 8 or 9 years ago but no issues ever again with the ear or hearing or balance. After the first shot I twice thought I had a blockage or something in the ear. Tried drops, wax remover whatever you can find, nothing helped. Eventually it subsided but never gave real vertigo or long lasting balance issue. After 2nd shot was immediately an issue. Constant sweating and 99.5 fever for the 11th, 12th and 13th. 3 days straight of just sweating. Vomiting on around or just after midnight on the 13th, into the morning of the 14th. End of the 14th leading to the 15th the Veritgo has a light migraine attached. The migraine is mostly in the right eye has any migraine I&#39;ve had is, comes with some light nasal pressure right at the eye socket. No issues with nasal drip or stuffy nose. Slight blurred vision which either creates the migraine or is from it. I also had migraines in the past but no more than 1 a year for the last 5 years, nothing I have medication or treatment for any longer.  This vertigo has a low grade migraine with small dot of blurred vision from one eye, my right eye. I dance with my daughter which is usually holding hands and spinning until her feet come off the ground. The first recognition that something is terribly wrong in my ear was that the moment I spin I can&#39;t rotate more than once rapidly without becoming incredibly unstably dizzy. That regardless of the vertigo, migraine or anything has been true since the 2nd shot when I spin I am at a total loss of balance.  There is constant dizziness, blurred vision, migraine

T&#43;24hr: ....headache growing. Went home and found fever at 102°.  Slight chills, bit mainly just heat without sweating. Fever hit 103.2 at peak. Went through 10lbs ice to keep the fever in check. Headache from T24hr-T36HR feels like a spike through the top of frontal lobe to my left eye.  T&#43;32hr: Headache still intense. Only back pain now. Appetite slowly increasing.  T&#43;48hr (Saturday morning). Back pain persists, but mild. Headache gone. Have a relatively normal day.  T&#43;60hrs (Sat. Afternoon): Back pain increasing. Stop all unnecessary lifting/moving.  T&#43;68hrs (early Sunday morning): Go to ER with the back pain. Absolutely excruciating spasms from top of sacrum - roughly LI/12T. Lower back stiff as wood. Given shot or Toradol, dose/prescription to flexiril. I specifically request this plan because usually takes care of the spasms; basically, get me able to move and the pain/spasms will go away.   NOTE: I have a history of back issues in this area, but I have not had an episode in years and certainly never had an episode that works like this with no relief. From about 2017-2019, I r  T&#43;70-78hrs: Feel normal.  T &#43; 78-88hrs: lower back pain comes back with an absolute vengeance.  T&#43;90hrs (early Monday morning): Return to ER. Back pain worse than Sunday morning. Receive toradol shot and prescription Prednisone. Back pain gone by around 10:30 AM. Decide to take prednisone Tuesday morning as its getting a bit late in the day by the time pharmacy fills the prescription.   T&#43;90hrs: Back pain returns in similar fashion as Sunday afternoon.

When Pt came for his 2nd vaccine he reported he had blisters 24 hours after his 1st dose, he was unsure if it was due to something he had eaten. 1st time 5 blisters, in upper right corner of the mouth 2 on gums and 3 on the cheek side. (all inside of the mouth). Vaccine was on the right arm his first injection. Took about 3-4 days to recover the 1st time. Started gargling with salt water, after a few days and this seemed to have helped. He put his finger on the blisters the 1st time and has a strange taste and discharge from the blister.

                                                A few minutes after giving vaccination, patient&#39;s mother and caregiver stated that he was having a reaction.  Patient can only use his eyes to respond &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34; since he is non-verbal and when he would not respond to his mother&#39;s questions with his eyes she became very panicked and alerted the pharmacy staff.  When I got to the patient he was very clammy, sweating, and breathing heavy.  She said his eyes had rolled back in his head and his tongue had turned blue.  I propped his legs up on a chair and took his blood pressure with an automatic blood pressure cuff and it was 164/124 with pulse 95.  I decided to contact EMS for assistance. Retook BP  few minutes later and it was the same.  EMS arrived and stated it was most likely a reaction to being afraid of needles but would take him to get checked out.

                                                3 days after the shot,  1/3, I started to feel soreness under my tongue.  I&#39;ve felt this before when starting to feel sick.  It progressively got worse, appearing to have peaked on 1/5.  It is painful all the time, but really hurts to extend my tongue and swallow.  While it hurts on both sides, it seems to be worse on the left side.  When I lift my tongue and look in the mirror, it looks like the tissue is swollen some on the left.  I scheduled a visit with the ARNP at my doctor&#39;s office, who I mentioned earlier.  She couldn&#39;t determine an exact cause.  She believed it could possibly be an immune response to the vaccine or something viral.  If it gets worse or doesn&#39;t go away after a week she asked that I call back.   The pain is unresponsive to 400 mg of Ibuprofen.  If I take 800 mg I do get some relief, but can definitely still feel it.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

My wife helped me downstairs and after some water and Tylenol, symptoms reversed themselves in about 15 minutes.  My body temperature was not recognized by the thermometer and then registered 93.4

At the time of patient&#39;s vaccine (01/19/2021), the patient was unaware of his spouse&#39;s COVID-19 status, as they had little contact with others and thought it was a cold. Patient began having COVID-like symptoms on 01/23/2021: cough, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, muscle/body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patient has had two subsequent negative COVID-19 tests while symptomatic. Because of his symptoms, his spouse&#39;s symptoms and positive COVID status, practitioners have cautioned patient to act as if he has COVID. He is under quarantine orders per Public Health. The concern from the patient, Doctors and Public Health officials has been the patient&#39;s negative status while obviously symptomatic, and if he can pass COVID if he is symptomatic but testing negative. He has another test scheduled for Saturday 1/30/2021.

                                                There is blue discoloration at the center of my tongue. It is painless, I would not even know it was there were it not for sticking my tongue out to brush it in the mornings. It only happens overnight, now 2 consecutive mornings since the 2nd dose of moderna. No edema, sore throat, or swelling. I have photos that I can send. It looks like I ate a blue colored candy, but I didn?t. I wake up like this from sleep.

We monitored him for over an hour and during that time, he continued to c/o dizziness, frontal headache, photophobia, and worsening when opening his eyes are trying to look straight ahead. We had him isolated in a dim room and had air blowing on him as he complained of being hot. His O2 Sat, pulse , and BP all stayed stable and within normal range. Pt. denied sx of swelling around face/neck or difficulty breathing. RR was stable and unlabored at all times. Pt. refused EMS services and after some time, insisted he needed to get up and leave. Our staff and his co-worker assisted him out of the facility and to a vehicle where we was transported off the premises.  We were informed later through his supervisor that he got worse after leaving and went to the hospital where he &#34;seized.&#34; He is reportedly stable at this time but further information on his condition is unavailable.

Maybe it can be correlated with other individuals with the same effects. I began having sudden vision loss (blurred vision) on Feb 10th and has only gotten worse since.

We kept an eye on him for about 20 minutes, he wasnt wanting to eat his lunch.  His face was also flushed which can be an indicator that he doesn&#39;t have enough prednisone on board.  We gave him an additional dose of his morning prednisone dose, 7.5 mg.  The swelling subsided in about 30 minutes, he ate and said he felt much better.  We will double his evening dose and contact his endocrine doc for more instructions.

A shopper alerted our staff and when I came to check on him, he was just rousing but had his eyes closed due to blurred vision. He was able to speak and look directly at me. He said this reaction had never happened to him before. He seemed jittery probably due to the reaction. Asked for water and was able to drink. He said that he most likely hit his head and compressed his finger during the fall but feels okay. We are not sure how long he was out for.

                                                Patient noted he had no adverse reactions with his first dose of the Covid vaccine or other vaccines he has had in the past.  He was informed that  there are more chances of side effects experienced with the second dose ( such as headaches, flu like symptoms, nausea).  He was directed to stay in the store for at least 15 minutes and to inform the pharmacy immediately if he felt anything  out of the ordinary.  He said he walked down several aisles then started feeling light headed and having tunnel vision.  He was on his way back to the pharmacy when he ended up on the ground.  He does not remember how he ended up laying on the ground.  He said his head did not hurt but does not know if he hit it.  When started regaining conscience, his right arm and leg jerked somewhat then calmed down.  When he came to, he said he didn&#39;t feel dizzy when he tried to sit up.  The ambulance was called so he was instructed to remain laying on the floor.  The EMT personnel asked him his name, the date, and where he was while he was laying down and after sitting up on the floor.  He answered correctly both times.  He was then asked to sit down on a chair to take his blood pressure.  The EMT personnel were having trouble   getting a good reading so he was transported to Hospital.

                                                The side effects I&#39;m experiencing didn&#39;t start until about 2 days later.  It started out as pain at the injection site with extremely bad dizziness that has gotten worse each day. On day 4 after the injection I noticed a full pain in my left thumb area. The same side as the injection. I didn&#39;t think anything of it but as the hour&#39;s and days went by it continued and continues to get worse. The best way I could explain it is it feels like when your hand falls asleep without the pins and needles. Yesterday I ended up having to go to the ER. My issue with my left thumb area started to get much worse. I couldn&#39;t hold things in my left hand and started to radiate up my arm. It was the weirdest feeling I can&#39;t really explain it other than being slightly numb and very week. I wasn&#39;t able to move my hand much at all. They gave me a cat scan but they never called me back to be seen or to give me my results. I was there for 8 hours and was never called back to be seen. I had to leave this morning before I was seen because I didn&#39;t have anyone to watch son. Today is 8 days since I received my first covid shot and I still have major fatigue along with dizziness. I will start sweating profusely out of nowhere and then stops.  I&#39;ve had a numb/metallic taste in my mouth for about 4-5 days as well. I feel like I&#39;m in a complete fog and can&#39;t shake this feeling. I&#39;m having trouble concentrating and remembering things. I&#39;m drinking lots of water and trying to rest when I can but I&#39;m still feeling terrible with no signs of this getting better. My doctor suggested I report this to you and I&#39;m hoping and praying this goes away. Is there anything I can do or a specialist I could see? Thank you so much in advance.

                                                Around 7 PM on Tuesday, I began to feel fatigued. My abdomen became slightly tender. My arm was sore in the injection site, but that was nothing that I did not expect. As the night went on, I began to feel worse. I developed chills? And became feverish. I did take my temperature and it was 99.5° at one point. I took acetaminophen to help with the fever and bodyaches. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen seem to stem the fever symptoms. The highest my fever has ever been since Tuesday was 100.1°.  When I have a fever I do become congested. So I have not thought anything about congestion as I do develop congestion when I chill. I did develop a muted sense of smell and taste. I can still taste what I am eating and drinking.  My biggest concern is that I would love for my fever to go away. It is making me incredibly fatigued.

                                                Within five minutes of the vaccination, the patient expressed distress.  Patient was slumped over in his seat, extremely labored breathing and his eyes were rolling to the back of his head.  The Pharmacist spoke to the patient to see how he was feeling but he wasn&#39;t very responsive so we administered an Epipen and immediaetly called 911.  The paramedics came at around 6:20pm and checked the patients vitals. EMT said the patients vitals were normal and have the patient the option to go to the ER.  Patient was alert and able to drink water.   Patient refused hospitalization.  We advised the patient to go directly to the emergency room if he was developing any symptoms once home and to follow up with his primary care provider.

                                                An hour after injection I tried eating some food and found that if I chewed and swallowed too quickly I began to have q tickle in my throat that led to coughing and vomiting, this symptom has begun to fade. I also started having pain in my right arm after a few hours, which I expected, but at roughly 2am the night of the injection, my right armpit also started feeling painful. It&#39;s now been 2 days and while most symptoms have abated, my right armpit is still incredibly sore.

                                                Approximately 3- 5 minutes after felt strange mild sensation as if pins and needles was moving throughout my body from the injection site. I also started to breathe differently. Couldn&#39;t tell if my heart rate changed or not.   At about 5 minutes, I started to feel light-headed and nauseous as if I just had blood taken or an IV in my, likely a drop in blood pressure. I was reading a book, put it down on my lap as I couldn&#39;t focus on reading and considering to get help. At that moment, I passed out, hunched over in my chair staring at the floor.   This moment likely lasted for about 1 minute, but felt like 20. I was in a dream like state and at one point had a series of images and/or memories flash by in a sequence. Then, I felt like I was half asleep but couldn&#39;t tell what I was staring at but knew that I had to &#34;wake up&#34;.   Then , I was surrounded by people who helped me up. At this moment I felt very weak and tired and was sweating profusely. My right hand felt very weak.   About 10 minutes later, I started feeling better. I was given water which seemed to help. I would have waves of mild nausea come and go that eventually subsided. I also felt random cramping around my stomach/lower chest area and lower right side rib cage area.   At about 15 -20 minutes felt confident to walk to the bathroom and throughout the store. Eventually, I felt confident to drive safely home.  At the time of writing this (approx 2 hours later), I&#39;m feeling random sensations/feelings of itchyness throughout my body. No sign of hives.

Within the next ten minutes  became dizzy then fell out of the chair onto the floor where he struck his nose and eye area on the floor. Patient lost consciousness for about 30 seconds then woke up. Patient had profuse bleeding from the nose and dizziness for 15 minutes.  We had patient sit on the floor and press towels to his head to stop the bleeding. We gave an instant cold pack to patient. We called 911 and requested medical assistance due to the amount of bleeding that patient was experiencing. EMS arrived and took charge of the scene. EMS providers attempted to help the patient to his feet and he fell again. EMS decided to transport the patient to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                6 days after vaccine I developed painful hives along my joints, many on my hands, swollen lymph nodes, swollen tongue, both affecting swallowing, severe burning sensation on my tongue, numerous sores in my mouth including on my gums, and cold sores on my lips. As a result I?m unable to speak or eat. Recommended treatment has been Tylenol, and antihistamine. I?ve been taking probably more than recommended of both, and as of today, all symptoms persist.

                                                Approximately five minutes after shot, my face began to tingle. My heart felt like it was racing. I had difficulty focusing with my eyes, it felt like my eyes were rolling.  My feet began to tingle. My spouse honked the car horn for assistance. I reached for my epi pen but did not administer it because a doctor was approaching our car. I checked my pulse rate on my iWatch, it was 168.  My throat began to feel tight. The doctor listened to my lungs and heard wheezing. A paramedic came over as well. My blood pressure was taken but I do not remember what my blood pressure was.  At that point the doctor said I should use my epi pen. The paramedic said I should use Benadryl. They were in disagreement, and the paramedic said I should take 50mg of Benadryl and had me put my car seat in recline position.  It was at the point they noticed that my face and chest were flushed.  They had me drink water.  We waited about 45 minutes. My lungs were checked again by the paramedic and I was told my lungs were clear, my blood pressure was taken second time but I do not remember my blood pressure, my face was less flush,  my pulse was in the 70?s.  I still felt tingling on my scalp and feet, my throat felt like it had a lump in it.  I Began to feel nauseous.  I was given the okay to leave and go home.  I had nausea until the evening the next day.  I did not eat until dinner time the night after my shot.  I only drank water.  The next day I experienced shortness of breath performing  duties that typically do not make me out of breath.  I had to take many breaks and used my abuterol inhaler two times.

                                                Vaccine given on 5/7/2021 in the back of my arm in the fat portion. A bump formed on the back of my arm which was 6.25 inches long and 3.5 inches wide. I had 103.5F fever, nausea, body ache, and site pain. On 5/10/2021, the adverse events started. The injection site started itching, my face started itching, tingling and swelling in my face and lips. 5/12/2021, the injection site still itches, face and lips are still swollen. Took Benadryl gel capsules. I noticed as the swelling in my arm goes down, the other symptoms are going away.

                                                On the following night of the booster shot of my  vaccination (May 24), I had symptoms similar to COVID-19 (fever, body pain, and fatigue). The symptoms were reduced after taking Ibuprofen (200 mg) in the morning (May 25).  On May 26, I felt postnasal drip in the morning and I took a Fexofenadine (180 mg) in the morning. It did not help much and I took Zyrtec (10 mg) in the evening. It did not help either and during the same night, I had a soar throat. In the morning of 27th May, I had the feeling of sinuses infection (thick yellowish mucous, pain in the left cheek and teeth, pressure in my head, fatigue). Was seen by a nurse practitioner who was suggesting me taking some OTC medicine, but considering my past history of sinuses and ineffectiveness of OTC against it, I did not take any of those OTC medicine. Then she  prescribed me Amox-Clav (875 mg) twice a day. On May 28, I woke up with mild body pain, nasal congestion, pressure in my head and I took my Multivitamin, Biotin, ibuprofen (400 mg), and second dose of Amox-Clav.

At 1537, client asked EMT is it normal to feel a little warm and for my lips to tingle?? PHN overheard and escorted client to the zero gravity chair while EMT obtained the E kit and vital sign equipment. Upon further assessment, the client stated, ?about 5 minutes before my 30 minutes were up, my lips started to feel weird and slowly increased then plateaued.

I breathe through my nose mostly and I&#39;m in very good pulmonary and cardiovascular condition.  I went for a run and 1 mile in I started drooling a lot! Spitting out mouthfuls every 15-30 seconds and I never spit.  Then my chest got tight and hurt and got irritated.  The feeling was identical to Bronchitis.  I started walking home and my breathing rate increased with wheezing. I got nauseous and was bent over with saliva poring out of my mouth.  Walking up one flight of stairs was difficult.  I have a finger pulse oximeter and it was at 84!  Breathing was very rapid and difficult. After 5 minutes it went up to 94 and then up to 98-99 after 1 more minute (when my pulse fell back under 100bpm.  Chest tightness continued for about 1 hour before I was back to normal for the most part. by today I feel 100% again.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

                                                Nausea, lightheadedness, and finally numbness to right side of face, slight drooping on right corner of mouth and right side of bottom lip. It began with a tingling feeling in lip. Observing staff did not notice any swelling, or other impairments, asked me if I had anxiety, and sent me on my way. Shortly after, it felt as if I had gotten a shot at the dentist, and had the tingling numbness left over on the right side of my face. About 4 hours later, my bottom lip and right side of my mouth drooped slightly, but I could still smile, talk, raise my arm, so there was no other impairment. By the next day the numbness had mostly subsided, and the nausea and lightheadedness was gone. This vaccine was given to me at a work clinic in the administration building. I do not have contact information for them but was provided a packet with this website. I don&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions, do not have anxiety, am not a hypochondriac, did not even know about the Bell&#39;s Palsy issues in trials until after I felt numbness, and the right side of my face felt as if it fell asleep, like a foot falling asleep but it was my face. It was not to the extent of Bell&#39;s palsy, and may have even been my bottom lip swelling slightly on the right side that caused the droop. It infuriates me that this side effect was dismissed as me having anxiety because I was nervous that my face was going numb which would be a natural reaction for anyone.

The right side of my bottom lip started tingling about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I had no swelling or other impairment at the time and was released after 40 minutes of observation. A little later the entire right side of my face felt as if it had fallen asleep, approximately 1 hour later and it worsened until about 4 hours later. By the next day the nausea and lightheadedness was gone, and the tingling/numbness to the right side of my face was gone within 48 hours, improving after 24 hours.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after my second Moderna vaccine, I experienced the typical body aches, chills, headache, and tiredness expected in someone my age (38).  I was initially happy that my immune system seemed to have a positive response to the second dose.  About 24 hours after my second dose, I developed a severe headache and nerve pain all over the right side of my head.  No over the counter medicine would relieve the pain.  The next day, I developed a rash on my forehead.  The rash quickly spread and consumed the right side of my face and my right eye.  I was seen by medical staff, and received a diagnosis of severe shingles.  I was given Valtrex and, eventually, gabapentin.  My eye continued to get worse and I lost clear vision in my right eye.  I saw an ophthalmologist and was told that the shingles had activated in the eye.  My eye pressure was dangerously high.  I was given steroid drops and drops to relieve eye pressure.     Since February 22, I have battled shingles.  My rash is gone and my eye has cleared.  But, I still suffer from intense nerve pain in my head, forehead, and eye.  All medical professionals opined that the moderna vaccine must have played a role given the timing.  If shingles can be considered a side effect, it is one that has been intense and long-lasting.

                                                Severe tinnitus.   I had tinnitus prior to the vaccine that I acquired in June of 2020 from taking Wellbutrin.  In the 2-3 months prior to the Moderna vaccine the tinnitus had quieted down to very tolerable levels for the most part - but would increase during times of stress.   Starting maybe 4-7 days after the first dose of the vaccine my tinnitus is now louder than ever and nonstop 24/7.  I also have had sporadic flashes of earache pains in my right ear...my right ear is where the tinnitus is loudest (was also where it was loudest prior to vaccination)

                                                I began experiencing a high pitched, singular buzzing in my ears the morning after I received the vaccination. It initially started as an intermittent noise that came and went throughout the day.  Unfortunately, the sound level and length of buzzing both increased as the days passed. By Saturday, March 20th, the buzzing was loud and continuous and was affecting my ability to carry out day to day activities. Now. on March 23rd, I hear the buzz whenever I&#39;m awake. It&#39;s now accompanied by a headache that usually begins in the early afternoon. I haven&#39;t been able to find any respite or cure for the noise, and have been taking Tylenol to help the headache and using a white noise machine to help sleep. I&#39;m very, very hesitant to receive the second dose if the ringing may further worsen.

                                                Patient called me about  4 and a half hours after his immunization. He stated his eyes have become sensitive to light .  He also stated that his bottom lip and chin started to tingle about fifteen minutes after the shot and then went away.  . I recommended that he immediately take a Benadryl tablet and wait a couple of hours I said he can take Benadryl every six hours if he needs to. If his symptoms don&#39;t go away  after two doses of Benadryl  I recommended he go to the Emergency Room and be checked out. Pre -immunization I counselled him  on the normal  run of the mill possible side effects and how to treat them.

                                                Within 5 minutes of shot my jaw and tongue started feeling numb, so I called them back over to ask if it was normal. Within a few minutes after that I told them my throat was starting to close up, I was having trouble breathing and both arms went numb. They said I was very pale, horse when talking and that they were going to start treating me for anaphylaxis due to my throat and airway issues. They immediately called for ambulance and  gave me 10 ml of liquid Benadryl and prepped an epi-pen. Within maybe 5-10 minutes the Benadryl help stop the throat closing and I asked them to not inject the epi-pen until the EMT arrived since the symptoms held and didn?t get worse.

                                                On Friday, April 2nd, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  Within minutes, my heart started racing and I felt faint.  Thereafter, my hands and face got the sensation of tingling.  It felt like ice was running through my veins.  My heart stopped racing approximately fifteen or so minutes after it began.  The tingling sensation in my hands and face ended approximately one hour later.  I also noticed a strange taste in my mouth during this same timeframe.  Subsequently, I had the sensation of being dizzy and lightheaded.  Importantly, I have never reacted to a vaccine in this manner.  On Saturday, April 3rd, I woke up with symptoms that were to be expected.  My arm was very sore and I felt a little achy.  However, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded.    That evening and for the next week or so, my heart was beating rapidly, and my blood pressure was elevated.  I also had the continuous feeling of my skin crawling.  My hands and feet also seemed to be experiencing tremors and twitching.    On Sunday, April 4th, I woke up and noticed that my right eye seemed a little blurry as I read an article on my phone.  I assumed I must have slept on my eye wrong and did not pay it much attention.  I do not recall my eye being blurry for the rest of the day.  The following morning on Monday, April 5th, I woke up once again feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  As I walked to the restroom, I noticed that my right eye was blurry again.  This time it seemed to be more pronounced.  Moreover, when I closed my right eye, I could see hundreds of dots in different colors.  In addition to having blurry vision, my legs felt weak and nearly buckled as I walked.  I felt like I was intoxicated.  Upon returning to bed, my teeth began chattering and I felt like I was freezing.  I called my doctor?s office and spoke with a PA who recommended that I go to the ER.    While I checked in at the ER, I could not remember my ZIP code.  I felt like my brain was not running on all cylinders.  Upon explaining my symptomology to the ER doctor, she recommended that I have my blood drawn and that I get an MRI to rule out a stroke.  All test results came back normal.    On Wednesday, April 7th, I made an appointment with an allergist.  They tested me to see if I was allergic to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polysorbate 80.  For the skin scratch portion of the test, neither of the substances had much of a reaction on my skin.  I thought the Polysorbate 80 scratch had a little bit of redness to it, but it was negligible.  When the doctor injected Polysorbate 80 under my skin with a syringe, a welt formed.  I am not sure why, but PEG was not injected in the same manner.  As a result of the test, the allergist confirmed that I am allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He mentioned that there may be instances of cross reactivity to PEG for individuals that are allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He recommended that I not get the second Moderna dose unless it was administered in a controlled setting.    On Sunday April 11th, I noticed what felt like a hard vein in my abdominal fat.  It felt slightly tender to the touch.  I was fearful that it could be a clot.  On Tuesday, April 13th, I woke up and as a I stood in the shower, my foot was painful to stand on.  On top of my right foot near my ankle, I could visibly see red inflammation in a vein.  I massaged the vein and the redness and pain dissipated.  Being fearful that I did have blood clots, I scheduled an appointment with a PA at my doctor?s office that same day.  We discussed my ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and me being fearful of blood clots.  She had an EKG performed at the office and ordered a barrage of blood tests.  Everything continued to be normal.    On Sunday, April 18th, I again went to the ER, because the hard vein in my stomach became larger and more tender to the touch.  When I bent over, it felt like there was a lot of pressure emanating from the hard vein down to my groin.  Once again, blood was drawn and everything was normal.  I also had an ultrasound performed on the area that felt like a hard vein and the doctor concluded that it was most likely swollen lymph nodes.  I was diagnosed with lymphadenopathy.    On Monday, April 26th, I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss the ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and pain in my stomach and groin area.  He told me that he had seen other patients that were experiencing similar symptoms and that my immune system was possibly overreacting to the vaccine.  He told me the symptoms should go away in time.  He also ordered a new blood test to check for clots.  The D-Dimer test came back normal.    On Tuesday, April 27th, I experienced a painful genital herpes outbreak.  I normally get one every year.  I had just recovered from an infection in December of 2020.  This outbreak was more intense and for the first time I had nerve pain that wrapped around my hip and down my inner thigh.  As of a week later, the infection is almost gone.      Today is May 4th, and I am still experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness.  Some days are better than others and every time I get optimistic that my dizziness and lightheadedness is finally gone, it reappears.  Being an IT consultant business owner and an attorney, I need to think clearly for my profession.  The side effects from the Moderna vaccine have made it very difficult to function.  I would like to get fully vaccinated, but I am fearful of getting the second shot.  I do not want the vaccine to cause permanent neurological damage or worse.    Finally, I am sure your organization is aware, but there are many other people experiencing the same symptoms as me.

He reports to me that at approximately 11pm to 12 am after the shot he developed multiple blotches/speckles in his vision.  He also states he is experiencing some balance issues/vertigo but feels it could be due to vision issue.  Patient called me at 2:25pm on 6/8/21 and was still experiencing the vision issues.  He was waiting on a call back from his physician for advisement.  He also states that he was experiencing injection site pain, diarrhea, and stomach pain but experienced these same adverse effects with this first moderna vaccine.

                                                Patient called the pharmacy  (6/5/21) to talk about his Moderna Covid vaccinations. He stated he felt drained and sluggish. He had his 1st dose on 5/5/21 and his 2nd dose on 6/2/21. In general he has had the following: Headache, dry mouth, body aches, nausea, and fatigue. I asked him how he felt  the day he called on 6/5/21 (3 days post his second dose). He stated that he still had a headache and was fatigued (he only felt like lying down). Patient is an employee here and wanted to know what he should do about returning to work. I referred him to store manager. I gave her his number and she was going to call him. He had spoken to managers before 6/5/21. I explained that these side effects are possible with vaccines and that some patients respond with more side effects than others or have a stronger response. However, I am filing  a VAERS because the patient mentioned that he had the following after his 2nd dose. He stated that about an hour after his vaccine on 6/2/21, he had hives and itching on his arms and neck and dry throat. He stated that he has used Benadryl and hydrocortisone to treat these symptoms. I asked him did he have any reaction after his 1st dose on 5/5/21. He stated that he had itching in his throat after the 1st one, but he thought it was just a dry throat and did not know if it was coming from the vaccine. As far as I know, 6/5/21 was the first day that the he had let anyone at the pharmacy know about any side effects. I told him to let his primary care doctor know this information that we discussed. I also recommended that he could take Tylenol if he wanted to do so.  Patient used a Doctor on Demand service through employee and provider prescribed aspirin 325 mg tablet once daily.

                                                On April 1, 2021 the symptoms presented with right shoulder pain. Over the course of several days bilateral paralysis presented in the lower extremities.  On April 6, paralysis occurred in both hands/forearms. Then on April 7, bilateral facial paralysis was noted and was instructed to go to the local ER by PCP. A MRI of the brain and cervical region W/WO Contrast was performed along with spinal tap. On April 8, after a repeat MRI of the brain and cervical region, a diagnoses of Guillan Barre Syndrome was provided. April 8- April 12, 2021 IVIG therapy was administered while staying in the hospital. After the infusions were completed, I was moved to inpatient rehabilitation center on April 13. During my stay in the rehab unit I completed extensive therapy with OT/PT/SP along with neurophysiologist. I was discharged from hospital Rehab unit on April 22, 2021 (am). After discharge I was sent home and advised to continue outpatient therapy. I currently have paralysis in both legs, lower arms/hands, and right side of my face. I have been seeing a neruoopthamologist for my right eye as it can not close and is at risk for going blind. Currently I have not been given any sort of outcomes or time line as to when my condition should improve.

It did not appear to be bacterial. It spontaneously resolved a few weeks after each dose. Sensorineural hearing loss occurred about two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. This was confirmed by audiometric testing which showed a significant unilateral hearing loss in the right ear.  A prednisone taper was started followed by two transtympanic injections of dexamethasone over the next six weeks. There was no improvement. A hearing aid is now required.

                                                18 days after 2nd vaccination I started feeling intermittent paresthesias in my feet. These slowly progressed to my lower legs. After about a week I noticed numbness/paresthesias in my fingers and forearms. About a week later it progressed to my face and is now also in my oral cavity (teeth, tongue, and posterior oropharynx). The paresthesias have been accompanied with intermittent mild vertigo, headaches, mild shortness of breath, and palpitations.

Approximately two weeks ago (around 6/27/2021):  Sudden onset of pain in the chest, then heart felt like a clenched fist, then heart started racing.  Couldn&#39;t catch a breath and felt like passing out.  I crawled to my neighbors house and told them to call an ambulance as I thought I was having a heart attack.  While waiting for ambulance, got extreme chills and sweats.  Ambulance came and did EKG which was normal.  Gave me the option to go to hospital, but felt better so I declined.  Since I have gotten the vaccine, I have consistently struggled with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and lightheadedness, to the point where I feel like I&#39;m going to pass out, or die.

With in a 2 hour timeframe after that I started getting very very hot with profuse sweating and a severe mood change headache almost to where I could not function or think straight. Finally slowly subsided within several hours.   The few days following the shot now I have random body aches and light to moderate headaches throughout the day. With a more severe upset stomach on and off.

                                                On January 1 and 2nd,  approximately 10 days following administration  of Moderna vaccination,  I began to experience both hearing loss and tinnitus in my right ear.   The hearing loss and ringing noise in my right ear came on rather slowly, and progressed over a week&#39;s time.   There was no illness otherwise, and no trauma.  The ringing continued, and I sought out medical care from both Neurology and Otolaryngology.    My otolaryngologist could not find any cause and speculated that it could in fact be from the vaccination.  I underwent oral steroid treatment as well as a series of 3, sequential weekly steroid injections into my middle ear space, though my tympanic membrane.   I also started taking oral L-Lysine at the recommendation of my neurologist as well as other herbals including oral flavonoids to help reduce tinnitus.   None of the above treatments have made any improvement in my symptoms.   I had my hearing rechecked every week at ENT office and the same degree of hearing loss is evident.  None of which has returned to date.  I have most recently just last week begun to a pursue hearing aid device at the recommendation of my ENT physician.    I am currently scheduled for brain MRI to make sure there is not another physiologic cause such as a tumor or hemangioma on my nerve that would possible explain my new symptoms in the right ear.   That study is not completed yet.    The hearing loss and tinnitus is constant, and unchanged, now nearly 7 weeks.    The noise is significant and disturbs my sleep, and much of my daily function.

                                                I&#39;ve had COVID before - back in October of 2020. I had loss of smell and taste almost immediately. It took several months for smell and taste to return, mostly returning by early January 2021. There were slight exceptions.  I received the vaccine on 2/22 and starting on 2/25-2/26, I noticed that my taste has altered significantly. Almost everything I eat tastes like smoke. I&#39;ve had everything from eggs to steak to bread. Even drinking coffee or wine tastes like I am drinking a smokey liquid. I&#39;m not sure why this is happening and it has not improved since.   Sense of smell continues to remain in okay condition.

I also had a number of large hives acrss my right bicep and elbow, as well as a few smaller hives on my back and underneath my feet.    This reaction was the same reaction I received when I went to the ER on 12/10/2018 for difficulty breathing and an elevated BP.  The ER administered TORODOL and I reacted the same way, ending up in the ER the very next day due to the reaction.    I believe, after much diligent research, the reaction I received to the COVID vaccine was due to the Tromethamine in it, as this ingredient is also in TORODOL.

The reporter states that Patient&#39;s concomitant medications are gabapentin and duloxetine hydrochloride for chronic back pain.  On 11 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (unknown lot number) via intamuscular route on left arm for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On 11 Mar 2021, anaphylaxis 3 minutes post receiving the first dose of vaccine the patient developed numbness and his eyes became swollen, then numbness of the tongue, lips and closing of the throat, which all happened at the vaccination site.The attending EMT provided 3 pills of oral 50mg Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and did not apply an EpiPen. Patient&#39;s blood pressure went extremely high (180/111mmHg) instead of dropping. At that moment, it was decided to contact 911. The paramedics placed the patient on a stretcher and loaded him onto the emergency vehicle to be rushed to the hospital. On the way, the patient was given an EpiPen. While in the hospital, the patient was given more diphenhydramine and injected with methylprednisolone. Patient was in observation for 4 hours and then released with a prescription of an EpiPen. It was reported that the patient was extremely sleepy due to the medications given. When the patient arrived home, he went straight to bed.

Then this past Monday (15 Mar 2021), patient started developing shortness of breath and a resting heart rate of 135bmp. That day, the patient was taken to urgent care.  There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal. On Monday (22 Mar 2021), patient is scheduled to see a cardiologist who will place the patient on a machine to check his heart rate for 3 days to see what is going on. Follow-up with various health care providers was scheduled for the rest of the week. Nephrologist will be seen on Monday, Neurologist will be seen on Tuesday, and Kaiser will be visited on Wednesday. Reporter stated that even though asked to run bloodwork and images, the emergency room did not do it.  Lab work was performed on Monday (15 Mar 021) which came back normal.

Shoulders are achy.  Thoracic back still mildly painful to touch and feels like it is bruised but there is no discoloration, swelling or otherwise notable signs.  Also had abdominal muscle pain that felt like he was being punched in the stomach - still feels like he did a lot of sit ups.  Still having loss of appetite, loss of taste, and general fatigue.  He took Aleve once with relief of headache but no other doses have been taken.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night (4/2-4/3) approx. 14 hours after receiving Vaccine with noticeable ringing/hissing in ears.  This had never happened prior.I did not think much of it at the time and went back to sleep. On Saturday had intermittent ringing/hissing. By Sunday  it was constant all day with no breaks. Seemed to get slightly worse each day from Monday through Wednesday. Thursday( Today) was the first morning were I woke up and the ringing/hissing was slightly less terrible than the day prior. As of writing this  I have seen my primary care physician  an ENT and an Audiologist. PCP and ENT both noted no visible issues in ear. Audiologist reported no damage to hearing. All three agreed it was Tinnitus.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Generalized anxiety disorder and Gastric bypass in June 2020. Concomitant products included DIAZEPAM, DULOXETINE HYDROCHLORIDE (CYMBALTA) and ALPRAZOLAM (XANAX) for an unknown indication.   On 08-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 05-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 05-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SUICIDAL IDEATION (Suicidal idealization) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FEELING ABNORMAL (felt bad), SWOLLEN TONGUE (tongue swollen), MENTAL DISORDER (Mental health issues), PARAESTHESIA ORAL (bad tingling in mouth), ERYTHEMA (Face is red) and VERTIGO (mind is spinning). At the time of the report, SUICIDAL IDEATION (Suicidal idealization), FEELING ABNORMAL (felt bad), SWOLLEN TONGUE (tongue swollen), MENTAL DISORDER (Mental health issues), PARAESTHESIA ORAL (bad tingling in mouth), ERYTHEMA (Face is red) and VERTIGO (mind is spinning) had not resolved.            Treatment included benadryl.  Patient mentioned he went to urgent care, his covid test was negative, psych evaluation recommended help for side effects only.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.

                                                I began to feel a little dizzy on 03-25.   This light lack of equilibrium steadily grew for the next couple days. I found my limbs had apparently began to lose strength.  breathing became difficult  as if I could only take 1/4 breaths unless I actively forced myself to inhale deeply.  I developed sleep apnea about this time.  Driving became difficult. I was walking and driving as if I was drunk.  When walking, it felt as if I was on a swaying ship. Driving felt like my workvan was in a constant crosswind that I wanted to correct from.  At this point, I stopped driving.  That was on 03-25.  On 03-26 I suddenly developed up-beat nystagmus in my vision that continues to this day, making me functionally blind.  I visited multiple urgent care facilities.  Received full panel blood work, urine tests and a MRI. All tests came out completely normal.   Doctors are baffled. I was given Valium to help with my eyes and that does help a little.  However I&#39;m still unable to see adequately to function without assistance.

                                                I periodically experience aphthous ulcers in my mouth that respond very consistently (100%) to treatment with topical Triamcinolone Acetonide. Even a single application will significantly reduce the size, duration, and severity of a developing ulcer.  I happened to have two small aphthous ulcers at the time I got the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, and those ulcers were completely nonresponsive to what became very aggressive treatment (topical Triamcinolone Acetonide 4x daily for 2 weeks.)  The size, duration, and severity (pain) of those two ulcers were as if they were completely untreated, despite continuous, aggressive treatment. (Ulcers grew to several millimeters in diameter, took ~2 weeks to subside, caused severe pain that interfered with eating/brushing/talking.)  I did not happen to have any aphthous ulcers at the time of the first dose of the vaccine. I also experienced whole body aches, chills, and fatigue with both doses of the vaccine.

Second week I?ve been dizzy. No appetite. Face tingling and numbness. Headache. I was Covid tested which was negative. Primary doctor has told me it?s neuralgia. Still have dizziness and on and off numbness in back of head and jawline. Sometimes my tongue going numb. An hour or two later my cheek will go numb. Very strange and very annoying. I?m still fatigued with no appetite.  Really hoping it starts to get better soon.

                                                Patient was given his first modern dose.  About 10 minutes after vaccination the patient and his wife alerted me that he was feeling like he was going to pass out.  Also reported feelings of ringing in ears, nausea, cold sweats and very pale.  I had the patient sit on the ground.  I offered him water, but his wife got him a soft drink.  He notified us that he had not eaten today.  We gave his wife glucose tablets which the patient took 2.  He took the 2 glucose tablets while we waited for EMT&#39;s to arrive.  He had more color in his face after the soft drink and glucose tablets.  The EMT&#39;s evaluated him and decided to take him to hospital out of caution.

After Receiving my second dose, I experienced a second surge of all these symptoms. I will describe them in the next Vaers entry.

                                                1 week after the second dose, I was exercising in the early morning when suddenly my vision and hand-eye coordination were flashing, my hand appeared in a different position than where I thought it was. I tried to tell my sons to get help, but I couldn&#39;t say any words, just some repetitive mumbling. I was able to walk upstairs but couldn&#39;t speak for about 10 mins, and then everything was coming out slowly. It was about an hour before I could resume normal talking. I went to the hospital, where they gave me a CT scan, MRI, heart echo, and eventually a TEE. They said that I had a Transient Ischemic Attack, and they found a PFO in my heart that probably allowed a blood clot to travel to my brain.  They also did an ultrasound of my legs when I mentioned the timing of the vaccine, to make sure there were no other clots. I am taking baby asprin and crestor, and have an heart event monitor now for 30 days. I am also scheduled for more bloodwork and a pelvic scan. They say it is likely that they will want to close my PFO, but want to see all the test results first to rule out any other possible causes.

                                                Sudden sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear.  In the evening on May 8, I suddenly experienced a sense of fullness, partial hearing loss, and tinnitus in the right ear. On May 9, I went to an urgent care clinic and was diagnosed with eustachian tube dysfunction. I was instructed to take pseudoephedrine and a steroid nasal spray and told that it should clear up in a week or two. When my hearing did not return after a couple of weeks, I saw an ENT on May 27 and was diagnosed with conductive hearing loss and put on a course of oral steroids. I sought a second opinion and saw an audiologist on June 10, where I was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss. I was given a stronger course of oral steroids, followed by two intratympanic steroid injections. Neither the oral steroids nor the steroid injections have reversed any of my hearing loss, so it appears that I have permanent partial hearing loss and tinnitus in my right ear.

                                                The night of my second shot (around 8pm PST) I experienced extreme warm sensations in both feed, almost able to feel the contours of the nerves in my feet.  My toungue also felt cold later that night, and the nerves in my legs felt cold, despite my skin feeling warm.  I continued feeling warm sensations across both feet in the evenings and when sleeping throughout the following 2 weeks.  Beyond that I&#39;ve continued to have a warm/swollen sensation in the nerves in my legs below my knees, concentrated in shins.  I&#39;ve had a similar sensation in my forearms.    It should be noted that after my first shot (on 3/30), about a week later I started developing intermitent headaches, and then around mid april developed intermitent facial numbness and and some pain in my left jaw and around my teeth, but the proximity to my first shot wasnt as close, so didnt report that in this form.
