                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

                                                4 days later after the vaccine my left eye turned really red with crust and mucus coming out. I went to walk in clinic and was being treated for pink eye. I was started on an antibiotic eye drop. A day later my right eye started to have the same problem. I scheduled an appt with a eye specialist where he examined both eyes and said I had a major infection. I was started on steroid eye drops which I am still taking but seems my eyes are not getting better. I have a follow up with another specialist next week for further testing. I have been out of work due to this matter.

He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

I haven?t been able to sleep since then and my fever has spiked as high as 104.5. I?m also experiencing headache, ear aches, mild sore throat, nausea, and chest tightness/pain during deep breathing. No shortness of breath symptoms though. Aleve and Tylenol do not appear to be helping. I feel worse than when I had Covid back in November.

I only historically had gotten a total of 4 flu vaccines. 24 hours after Moderna I had b/l dorsal foot tingling that I didn?t really pay any mind to, then by the next day it spread to L hand (4th-5th digit) overt weakness and paresthesias and a cool/numb feeling to my R thumb. Similar symptoms to L 5th toe and R great toe. As days progressed it got more diffuse and extended up to mid-calf that was very mild... eventually by day 10 it dissipated, thank god.  To add I also experienced L facial dull pain and the distal portion of my tounge felt like I burnt it (lasted 5 -7 days)

                                                I had COVID-19 and tested positive on December 23rd, 2020. I had a loss of taste and smell. It was not a complete loss.  More like an 80% loss. I received my first COVID vaccine dose on 01/08/2021. By about mid January, however, I had almost all, if not all, of my taste/smell back. But after my second Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine dose, I lost my sense of taste and smell again. When I was at about 90-100% recovered, as of the 2 or 3 days following my 2md vaccine dose, I had lost almost all taste and smell again. As of today, 4 days after the vaccine, I&#39;m back to around 80% again. I have not had any other congestion, etc. that might explain my loss of taste and smell.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

                                                The evening of the vaccine it started with severe fatigue and a sore throat. The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

                                                The night of the injection started with severe fatigue and a severe sore throat, the next day I woke up with a sore throat so bad I could not swallow. I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

                                                Woke up on Friday morning (3/5) with severe neck pain and vertigo. Tried to walk to bathroom and was falling over to the right side and felt very nauseous. Starting throwing up. Arrived at ER around9:30AM and was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged a few hours later. He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

At approximately 9:30 pm, the patient became cold with shivering.  Temp fluctuated during night between 99 - 103.8. During the night, he experienced nausea and vomiting, dizziness, body aches, and a weird taste in mouth. On 1/7/21, patient still complained of fever, headache, nausea, and the new symptom of diarrhea.  His neck was now very sore, with pain moving it right or left.  On 1/8/21, slight improvement of symptoms.  On 1/8/21 at 7:00 pm, he noticed a very itchy, red raised rash on torso, arms and legs.  He called his physician and was called in a prescription for steroids.  The pharmacy was closed and he picked the steroids up on the morning of 1/9/21.  He took the steroids on 1/9/21  and has noticed major improvements.  Rash still present, but not itching.  Temp currently 99.1, but all other symptoms improved.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

                                                On January 1 and 2nd,  approximately 10 days following administration  of Moderna vaccination,  I began to experience both hearing loss and tinnitus in my right ear.   The hearing loss and ringing noise in my right ear came on rather slowly, and progressed over a week&#39;s time.   There was no illness otherwise, and no trauma.  The ringing continued, and I sought out medical care from both Neurology and Otolaryngology.    My otolaryngologist could not find any cause and speculated that it could in fact be from the vaccination.  I underwent oral steroid treatment as well as a series of 3, sequential weekly steroid injections into my middle ear space, though my tympanic membrane.   I also started taking oral L-Lysine at the recommendation of my neurologist as well as other herbals including oral flavonoids to help reduce tinnitus.   None of the above treatments have made any improvement in my symptoms.   I had my hearing rechecked every week at ENT office and the same degree of hearing loss is evident.  None of which has returned to date.  I have most recently just last week begun to a pursue hearing aid device at the recommendation of my ENT physician.    I am currently scheduled for brain MRI to make sure there is not another physiologic cause such as a tumor or hemangioma on my nerve that would possible explain my new symptoms in the right ear.   That study is not completed yet.    The hearing loss and tinnitus is constant, and unchanged, now nearly 7 weeks.    The noise is significant and disturbs my sleep, and much of my daily function.
