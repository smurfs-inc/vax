                                                I woke up at approximately 4:00 am with an extremely dry mouth. I went into the bathroom and took a drink of water. I returned to bed. I noticed that my breathing was becoming more rapid. I had trouble catching my breath. I sat up on the side of the bed. My heart was pounding and quick. My breathing was difficult. I woke up my wife. After about 5 minutes my symptoms improved. She took my pulse which was now at 62ppm.  I laid back down in a reclined position. My symptoms of difficulty breathing and elevated heart rate quickly returned. My pulse was now up to 98 ppm.  I sat up again. My symptoms gradually improved. Being unsure of what was going on my wife called 911.  The ambulance arrived in about 8 minutes.  I was about 60% better. Vitals were improving other than my blood pressure which was 180/100 Being unsure of what was happening, I was transported to Hospital.   I  had a chest x-ray, a chest CT scan with contrast to rule out a blood clot, blood work including tests to rule out MI x2. All test were negative.  By about 6:30 am I was feeling at least 80% better. My breathing I felt had returned to normal. My pulse was down into the 50&#34;s which is my normal range.

At 7:06 am I noticed  left side facial swelling and slightly obstructed throat.  Swelling worsened only slightly from 7am to 9am. At 9am I took 100mg Benadryl and withing 45 minutes swelling was subsiding and breathing was normal. Arrived at ER at around 11:am. Was treated with EPINEPHrine, methylPREDNISolone and saline IV. Released after a few hours

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

                                                About 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient experienced burning and tingling on his tongue and hands. Patient took 2 Benadryl 25mg capsules and was monitored for 15 minutes. Stated he was feeling much better and it was going home. I followed up with him this evening at 8pm and he was stating he felt fine now and just drowsy from Benadryl.

                                                Patient received their vaccine and sat in a chair, within approx. two minutes the patient told another patient they felt hot, I was already walking to the patient to check on them,. The patient&#39;s eyes were glazed, Almost immediately the patients eyes rolled back in his head. I shook his arm and shouted to him , he was unresponsive with agonal breaths.. I shouted for help from the other nurses. RNs came immediately. We moved him to the floor, called for an epinephrine injection to be prepared, I began to prepare the site for epinephrine injection to his thigh, nurse checked for pulse... at this time the patient was still unresponsive with agonal breaths... no pulse was felt so compressions were commenced by RN. Nurse gave approx. 15 compressions to the patients chest ,  the patient spontaneously  began to recover. Carotid and radial pulses were felt at this time. Breathing returned to normal. While this was occurring, we called a code blue and 911 was activated. By the time 911 responded the patient was fully conscious , alert and responsive. He could tell us his name and how he felt prior to this incident. The patient was transferred via a  stretcher by EMS 911 and RN accompanied him to the ER to give a report. The timeframe for being pulseless and having agonal breaths lasted no more than 30-40 seconds. Patient denied any history of a seizure disorder. No  epinephrine or IM Benadryl were administered at the incident site by the responding staff due to the spontaneous recovery.

                                                Received the first COVID vaccine on March 18 and two days later I suddenly lost hearing in my left ear. This was near total hearing loss. I could only hear a slight buzz when putting a phone to my ear and listening for the dial tone. Went to my health care provider a couple of days later. They cleaned both ears and examined for any obvious problems. This seemed to improve the hearing in the ear slightly. Physician&#39;s Assistant said the hearing loss was most likely a reaction to the vaccine and advised giving it two weeks to see if it improves. Hearing didn&#39;t improve much (if at all) throughout the remainder of the week. Over the weekend of March 27-28 hearing seemed to be improving. This morning, March 29, hearing has noticeably improved and I can carry on a phone conversation using my left ear. Hearing is not back to normal yet but it is much better than a few days ago.

Symptoms of greatest concern: Nausea, Headache, Chills for 1-2 days; and the ongoing Fatigue is now in its 4th day.  Details of symptoms with time of onset, duration and severity are provided below (Note: Injection with 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine took place at 9:24AM on 07APR21):  07APR21, 10:30AM ? Arm Pain: Onset of mild pain in arm that was noticed when not touching the arm; Level of pain was a ?1? out of 10).  An annoying level of pain where the pain ramped up to 3 or 4 on a scale of 10 when the arm was moved about began at 7:00PM on 07APR21 and lasted 12 hours until 7:00AM on 08APR21.  The pain diminished to a mild ache for another 33 hours until it became insignificant by 4:00PM on 09APR21.  07APR21, 1:00PM ? Dry Eyes: Onset of an intermittent feeling of very dry eyes that lasted approximately 1-2 hours at a time and continued over a period of 9 hours until 10PM on 07APR21.  07APR21, 3:30PM - Fatigue: Onset of mild fatigue that steadily increased until bedtime at 10:00PM on 07APR21; and was significantly more pronounced at 1:00AM on 08APR21 (was difficult to stand and walk 20? to closet to obtain a thermometer; could not walk straight and bumped into hallway on left 4-5 times).  Fatigue was rather frightening and severe from 3:00AM to 3:30AM on 08APR21 when I crawled to the bathroom, but could not get off my knees and collapsed on the floor until I could return to bed by crawling on the floor.  Was able to stand again at 7:00AM on 08APR21 and walked (slowly) 30? to a sofa.  Slept from 10PM on 07APR21 to 1:00AM on 08APR21; 4:00-7:30AM on 08APR21; 8:30-10:30AM on 08APR21; 11:00AM to 3:00PM on 08APR21; 7:00PM on 08APR21 to 3:00AM on 09APR21; 3:30AM to 7:30AM on 09APR21; 9:30PM on 09APR21 to 9:15AM on 10APR21; 6:40PM on 10APR21 to 7:00AM on 11APR21.  Ongoing weariness continues as I write this at 11:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Nausea: Onset of continuous nausea that lasted 13 hours and 20 minutes until 08APR21, 8:30AM. Nausea was particularly bad with intermittent dry heaves for the 7.5 hours lasting from 1:00AM to 8:30AM on 08APR21; Nausea then came in waves for 23 more hours until 09Apr21, 7:30AM when it was finally gone.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Headache: Onset of headache that has lasted 4 days (as of 11APR21, 10:30AM). Finally gave in and took one extended release tablet of 650mg Acetaminophen tablet about 25 hours after the vaccination (i.e., took painkiller at 10:30AM on 08APR21).  Took two Ibuprofen at 9:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Chills: Onset of chills that increased to intermittent shivering by bedtime at 10PM on 07APR21. Awoke at 1:00AM on 08APR21 and could not get warm.  Two hours later, at 3:00AM, I felt completely opposite and could not feel cool.  These symptoms gradually subsided and were gone by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Joint Pain and Muscle Aches: Onset of joint pain and muscle aches that occasionally became annoying with twinges of pain. These symptoms subsided by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Dizziness: Onset of mild dizziness that lasted 12 hours until 7:15AM on 08APR21.  08APR21, 1:00AM ? Measured Fever: Decided to measure temperature due to significant chills and shivering and found temperature was 101.0 at 1:00AM on 08APR21.  At 3:00PM on 08APR21, my temperature was 100.2 (this was 4.5 hours after taking one extended release tablet of 650mg acetaminophen).  At 3:00AM on 09APR21, my temperature measured 98.6 degrees and has remained near there ever since.  09APR21, 4:00PM ? Arm Rash: First noticed presence of a rash measuring about 2? x 3? on upper arm near the area that received the injection.  Mild itchiness was present about an hour later and a topical 2% diphenhydramine gel was applied.  The rash had dissipated by 5PM on 10APR21.

                                                I was extremely tired on Saturday. My shoulder hurt. About 3 pm, while urinating, I felt very light-headed as if I was about to faint. I stopped urinating and went back to bed.  That evening, about 8:30, I tried to eat dinner, but after three bites, I felt extremely tired. I leaned back in my chair, and I passed out. My wife woke me, but it took several minutes. She said my eyes rolled back in my head. She splashed water on my face. She said that I stopped breathing.  I woke up, then pushed my plate away and put my head on the table. I could not hold it up. I was sweating profusely. After several minutes, I felt that I was about to have diarrhea. My daughter and wife tried to walk me to the bathroom, but I did not have the energy to get there. I collapsed in the hall and hit my head on the door jamb. After several minute of trying , they pulled me up, and I then got the strength to walk the rest of the way. I had diarrhea, not suddenly, but it was as if my GI system emptied. It was soft, not loose, and there was a lot.  I went back to bed, and eventually slept.  I felt queasy the next day (Sunday), and I felt lightheaded at times, so I just sat or laid down. But I was feeling better. Today (Monday) I feel much better. A little tired, but much better. I went to the Pharmacy this morning, and they referred me to this website. I did not see the doctor.

                                                Because pt was uncomfortable he did not use his CPAP machine. 45 hours after second dose was administered my husband was sitting up in bed eating breakfast, He tilted his head back to swallow his his escitalopram and baby aspirin, sipped his coffee chewed and swallowed. He then went speechless and began staring off to his left. He lost consciousness. His chin stretched out to the left and his head rolled back as did his eyes. Eyelids remained open. His head and upper body began to tremble and seemed stiff though his hands remained down by his side. Time slows when in such an emotional situation but I think the complete event lasted about 35 real seconds.  I wonder if his temperature being elevated a couple of degrees and with his absolute lymphocytes on the rise if his strong immune response revealed a family predisposition to dystonia?

                                                The same night as my second injection I woke up drenched in sweat. The following day (Sunday)I felt very rough but by Monday was feeling well apart from having very sore gums that hurt when I brushed my teeth.  By the following day (Tuesday) my lips, and tip of the tongue had become numb and tingly as if I had returned from the dentist and had novocaine administered the effects of which had not fully worn off. The front of my mouth has stopped producing saliva so I get cotton mouth a lot and my teeth stick to the inside of my gums at the front if I do not constantly move my tongue around.

                                                Patient received his first dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine from a LPH clinic. This was a County Public Health event. Tim&#39;s administration was unremarkable and RN was the vaccinator. Patient went home to develop a sever headache and lost of peripheral vision. The loss of vision lasted two weeks and was so significant that he thought he had developed the COVID-19 illness and sought evaluation from Dr. He tested negative for COVID-19 and Dr. felt it was his immune system&#39;s response to the vaccine, given his history of migraines. He reported this to LPH today, 5/14/21 when he arrived for his 2nd dose. He has discussed dose #2 with his MD. He was counseled and feels the risk of COVID and neurological effects is too great and wants to proceed with dose #2. He is aware this VAERS was submitted and open to any contact. RN PHN

Patient states it has gotten a tiny bit better. Tried trazodone which helps temporarily. Denies chest pain. Patient states he has no appetite. Palpitations resolved pretty quickly. Shortness of breath is described as tightness that comes with anxiety feeling. Resolves with shoulder massage. Occurring three times per day. Also admits to dry mouth. Patient admits to needing to sleep with multiple pillows or feeling like he had to sit up and couldn&#39;t lay down as shortness of breath would get worse.  EKG in office on 2/24/21 showed ST-T changes and given symptoms patient was transferred to emergency room via ambulance.  Work up in hospital was unremarkable and patient was diagnosed with pericarditis (unknown etiology) and prescribed NSAIDS from ER and discharged.  Admission not required.   Patient followed up to us as outpatient on 03.02.21.  Patient felt much better and had not take motrin for 1 day.  COVID testing obtained at this point (unclear why ER did not send it).  Patient referred to outpatient cardiology given risk of cardiovascular disease, stress echo, and event monitor.

                                                I had Covid in December, 2020. Test result positive on 12/16, tested 12/15. Symptom&#39;s then were- chills, complete body sweats (soaking), fever (spiked to 102F, but would subside quickly), intense body aches and pain, lost taste and smell.  All symptom&#39;s lasted for apprx 3 weeks, except sense and smell, that took  3 &#43; additional weeks to return to almost pre-covid.  I drank pedialyte and cranberry juice, took EmergenC, a daily Multi as well as extra vitamins C and D everyday.  For pain a took 6-800 mg of Ibuprofen as needed.  Did not lose my appetite.

                                                started having intermittent headache on 03/08/2021 which he describes as dull pressure starting in his frontal sinuses and working the way posteriorly on both sides.  They are intermittently present and range from 2?5/10 in severity.  No associated photophobia. He has been taking Tylenol at home which provides moderate amount of relief.  He saw a provider on 3/15 and was prescribed high-dose Augmentin at that time which he has been taking without improvement.  He endorses subjective fevers and chills but his body temperature was 99 F.  Mouth ulcers started a few days ago. With that, it became very difficult for him to eat or drink due to excessive pain.   He became concerned because he was also on immunosuppression for transplant and ended up coming to the ER for further evaluation where he was admitted.   Of note, he was switched from Tacrolimus to Sirolimus 3 days prior to his vaccine  3/20 while inpatient, developed fever of 101. Blood cultures negative. Around time of drug changes and vaccine, patient also had a tooth repair.

I was unable to sleep the whole night so I can recall the ringing (sounded like someone was ringing a small Christmas  bell in my ear) it was intermittent, starting and stopping the whole night. The next day 03/27/2021 it became more and more constant.  Today is 03/28/2021 and it?s constant now and in both ears

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

                                                Patient came in for first dose of Moderna vaccine. He reported no previous allergic reactions in the past. Once the patient received a vaccine, he was instructed to wait for 15 minutes. Close to the 15 minute mark, patient described  his arm and face feeling &#34;hot and a bit heavy&#34; on the side he received the vaccine. Patient reported no swelling of the throat or face area. He had no trouble breathing. Patient did report he was experiencing some dry mouth. I assessed the patient for any rash, redness or hives around his face, arm and chest area. Patient was told to lie down on the floor and we elevated his legs. At this point, pt was still reporting no trouble breathing, but still felt hot around his arm, face, and chest area. An ice pack was placed around his face and neck which helped a bit. Patient kept describing a sensation of tightness and heaviness around his left arm and  fingers . We continued to observe the patient for another 30 minutes till paramedics arrived to take the patient to a nearby hospital.

                                                During 15 wait, after inoculation, I noticed some muffled hearing in my left ear, that I wrote off to head congestion.   Later that evening, I noticed the effect was sustained.  Woke up the next morning, 4/27, with some ringing in my left ear, and muffled hearing.  Worked on computer all day with no improvement, and no noticeable change.  Decided to report what may be a side effect. About 5 years ago, I had Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, with left side of face paralyzed, and very painful aural nerve attack in left ear, and loss of sense of sweet taste.  After about 8 weeks I had recovered 90%, or more.   No problems since then, as my sweet taste slowly returned.

After the first dose I developed high fever, body aches and lethargy on the sixth day and it lasted several days.  On the second dose, it followed the same timeline, but on day 6 my lips and cheeks swelled and kept swelling for 7 hours even though I was admitted to the hospital emergency room within the first hour and they gave me 4 drugs by IV to counteract the swelling.  The doctors told me I was having an allergic reaction, but I had not eaten anything out of the ordinary and I&#39;ve never had an allergic reaction of any kind.  They were reluctant to admit that it was a Covid vaccine reaction, but they couldn&#39;t find any other answer and I knew it was... the timing was too coincidental.  Also, the drugs they gave did nothing and it took several days for my facial swelling to diminish.

This is still ongoing to this day. I let a week go by and it was still there, I reported it to my doctor through a video chat. My doctor suggested to let it go and see what happens and contact him after I had my second vaccine and 2 weeks after that. I got back in touch with him and told him it hadn&#39;t gone away. He examined me and referred me to an audiologist. Audiologist had seen similar symptoms in other patients.  It wasn&#39;t affecting the way I hold my conversations, I can watch TV, it does not get in the way. The audiologist stated there was a possibility it could disappear or never go away.

                                                About eight hours after the injection, I noticed some hearing impairment in my left ear.  Sounds are muffled, almost as if I have water trapped in the ear canal.  I noticed this right before I went to bed, and the hearing loss is still present and similar in magnitude this morning.  There is no pain, and the hearing in my right ear seems to be normal, although I can&#39;t rule out some slight loss on that side.  Aside from a slightly sore arm at the injection site, I&#39;ve had no other side effects (e.g., no fever) from the vaccination.

He went to sleep and thought it would be better.  On Sunday morning he could not stand the sunlight at all, and pain on top of the eye.  He went to the ER and they called the eye doctor in.  He didn&#39;t know what was going on, had blood work done.  He told him to FU with his doctor.  Gave him eye drops, Ibuprofen and eye cream to go into the eye.  He is feeling better today, but when the light hits it a certain way the pain is bad, but it clears.  In the morning he has to get used to the sunlight.  His eye is red.  He is to FU with his PCP.

No productin of saliva was happening making swallowing difficult. Additionally eyes felt dry/itchy. Tongue and lips also felt swollen but didn&#39;t appear swollen. I was able to work up a slight amount of saliva after few minutes and swallow with moderate difficulty. Purchased a bottle of water and had no difficulty swallowing that. Did not seek assistance as my heart rate was normal, no difficulty breathing, no outbreak of hives or swolllen face/extremeities. Departed store at 25 min. as symptoms get worse.  Symptoms gradually abated by 12 hour mark.

                                                Had the Moderna vaccine 4-7 days later experienced Tinnitus. Feels a little pressure and occasionally when popped ears felt like had temporary relief of the pressure and tinnitus. Warm compress and pressure with fingers massaging at base of skull and gave relief until fall asleep. Both the tinnitus and the pressure seemed to improve with the heat and pressure,  It is constant and does not seem to be drowned out by other sounds. Hearing is good.  Tried IBU for a week and did not help much. Was taking 4 doses/day and no improvement, one incidence of standing at the counter and seemed like floor moved. It passed quickly. Other than this no other vertigo or lightheadenes.

                                                About 10 minutes after I received the shot I was sitting in a chair and I started getting very hot, sweaty, and found like I was going to throw up.  Started seeing stars, vision narrowing.  I laid down on the floor, and it seemed like I was having a hard time breathing.  The pharmacist came out and started talking to me. My wife happened to be there and was trying to calm me down.  I felt like I was passing out.  The pharmacist checked my BP and it was like 80 something.  He felt I was having an allergic reaction so gave me a show with an Eppy pen.  They called paramedics.  I started feeling better but paramedics said I should still go to ER so ambulance took me to ER.  They ran blood tests, EKG, and chest Xray.  After a few hours they released me.  They basically said that it was ok for me to get second shot, but obviously I am now extremely concerned out about getting it

The day after I got my first shot (Moderna), the tinnitus was immediately noticeable while waking up that day and has been constant ever since.  It is currently barely tolerable but I&#39;m having second thoughts about getting the second dose.  As best I can tell, there is no treatment available for tinnitus.

                                                Patient woke up the morning of 04/13/21 and explained to his wife that he felt &#34;foggy&#34; mentally. He went about his morning chores on the farm. He came inside to sit in his recliner with his feet elevated for almost an hour.  At approximately 9:40 am, his wife observed that patient suddenly stiffened without warning and cried out. His arms stretched over his head in the chair and his legs stiffened like a board. His body was visibly contracted.  He continued to cry out. His eyes were closed, he was salivating, and his forehead was sweating.  His wife watched him move his arms suddenly to his lap, however, his fists were clenched tight.  She tried to get his attention by calling to him. She noticed his lips were turning blue. She continued shaking him, shouting and then slapped him. Patient did not respond.  She called 911. After 7 minutes, he finally relaxed some and started snoring loudly in the chair. He continued sleeping soundly for about 10 minutes while she waited for EMS to arrive.  The wife did elevate his head , as she was told by 911 to do so.  She was not able to wake him up during this time period. When the EMS arrived, he was just starting to move. They got him up to stand and he was able to verbalize his need to go to the restroom.  They arrived at the hospital at approximately 10:25 am and was released after testing at approximately 2:30 pm.

                                                I personally began developing left eye symptoms (eye pain, redness, decreased vision and seeing halos around lights in my left eye only)  on February 21 and was subsequently diagnosed with pretty severe, acute left eye anterior uveitis on February 23. (Thankfully, it appears to have fully resolved with a course of ocular steroid eyedrops.) I received my initial Moderna vaccine on January 4, with my second dose on January 27.   I have never had anterior uveitis before, and of course I have no idea if it is related to my vaccination. I am at increased risk for anterior uveitis as I have psoriasis and I am HLA B27 positive.

Food that had a strong taste and smell came across as weak or had no taste. I could not smell strong scents around the house ( hand soaps ) unless I held it up to my noise.

I had taken acetaminophen by 18:00 and again at 24:00.  Much to no avail.  At 06:00  the pain was pretty severe yet and acetaminophen was not cutting it.  I had some hydrocodone from a previous injury still in my medicine cabinet, so I took one of them.  It made a big difference.  By 08:00 most of the symptoms had diminished.  I didn&#39;t take anything else until 17:00.  By then my left arm was really hurting.  By 21:00 the pain was all the way down my arm and up into my neck and  jaw.  I took another hydrocodone.  The pain was still pretty severe at 22:30 so I took 2 Ibuprofen.  my pain had diminished enough to get to sleep by 23:30.  When I work up this morning my pain was localized to just around the injection site .

Within 24 hours after receiving Moderna shot, Tinnitus grew markedly worse and has not subsided or returned to the pre-vaccine level. This side effect was NEVER disclosed to the patient. Had patient known this, he would NEVER have gotten the Covid-19 vaccine because living with heightened Tinnitus is unbearable.

The dizziness returns if I move my head too drastically, particularly if I lie down quickly in certain directions. If I am careful through the day I am not dizzy but there&#39;s the lightheadedness. Existing tinnitus also seems aggravated.

After my second shot on April 6, I had minor soreness around the injection site, fatigue which lasted two days and low grade fever which I treated with one 400mg dose of ibuprofen.  I also developed a persistent high pitch &#34;ringing&#34; in my head/ears.  I believe it&#39;s what is know as tinnitus.  The volume on a range of 1(low) to 10(high) is 2/3 to 5/6.  For the first four weeks after my second shot, the ringing was constant and daily.  I noticed beginning week 5 that there would be days where it would completely stop or be barely noticeable.  The quiet periods ranged from a couple of hours to almost an entire day.  The quiet periods are generally begin in the mornings when I first get up. Otherwise they don&#39;t appear to follow a pattern.  I also noticed, if I consume alcohol it lessens or eliminates the ringing.

I also experience the beginnings of a strange metallic taste in my mouth.  Sort of an iron/zinc/copper taste in my mouth that tainted the flavor of the morning cup of coffee and the other things I ate.  I thought it might be something wrong with me -- like some sort of cancer or something, but saw that others had experience the same symptom.  The taste sensation disappeared on 5/10/2021, a month after my second dose of my COVID-19.  I am still am experiencing episodic numbness in the 4th and 5th fingers on my left hand.

                                                Sudden Hearing Loss in Left Ear &amp; Tinnitus- On April 26, 2021, 12 days after my second Moderna vaccine. I woke up with no hearing in my left ear. I had my ear checked and there it was not infected, my primary care physician suspected it could be Allergies to pollen and said to take Fluticoasoe Propionate Nasal spray twice a day and one tab 24 Hr. Claritin D one time a day. After 4 days with no improvement to the hearing in my left ear, I decided to see an ENT. My first appointment was Friday, April 30, 2021, my Audiological Evaluation was 30 (mild) range in right ear and below 96 (profound) in my ear. The doctor prescribed an MRI (which came out normal), and put me on Prednisone 10mg for 12 days. I completed my oral Prednisone 20 mg 12 Day pack as prescribed, on my third visit (05/14/21) to ENT (slight improvement to hearing) he began Steroid injections into my left ear. Thus far I have had four steroid shots 05-18-21, 05-21-21, 05-25-21, each Audiological Evaluation since receiving the steroid injections show steady improvement and my hearing range is mild to moderate to severe. I am scheduled for another steroid injection and hearing test on 06-01-21. ENT also started me on Lipo Flavonoid for Tinnitus 6 pills a day (which has not improved). Last appointment on June 8/2021.

Previously, I have never had TMJ or bruxism issues, both of which have been diagnosed in the past two months and seem to have resulted from the post-vaccine pain. My GP prescribed anti-inflammatory pills that have helped to some extent with the neck pain and helped diminish the clenching. The original post-vax pain continues unabated, now three months later.

                                                My oxygen levels dropped below what they had been previously as I am recovering from Covid infection  tested positive 20 October 2020.  If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

                                                Have had off and on swelling of my lips and face for the past seven days. First time was full face swelling about 51 hours after vaccine and and 20 hours after eating lobster and other shellfish pasts dinner. (63 and never been allergic to shellfish before) on Saturday. First swelling went down slowly and gone within 24 hours. Following Tuesday, woke to swelling/numbness of lower right mouth &amp; lip. Lessened throughout day. Thursday, woke to upper left and upper right lips numb and swollen. Lessened throughout day. Today, woke to lower left lip numb and swollen like I?d been punched in mouth. Wife insisted I go see doctor immediately.

There is a some what dull pain above the left side of my top lip.  I do not get full pressure when spitting and the left side of my mouth does not seem to move when I spit.  It almost feels like it was shot up with Novacaine. I went swimming on March 14 and when I blew air out of my mouth  none came out of the left side.

Used generic &#34;Claratin&#34; at first. 6 days after injection, began prescribed NEO-POLY-DEX eye drops, Fluticasone Prop 50 mcg nose spray, Albuterol inhalations.   8 days after injection got an Albuterol breathing treatment and began prescribed 5-day Prednisone 20 mg treatment. Using over the counter DM cough suppresant since 6 days after injection.  As of 10 days after injection, expect to start prescribed antibiotic (type yet unknown) and Tessalon Perles for cough. Note that I have &#34;Hay Fever&#34;, but this event was notably more severe than have experienced in years.  Also tend toward bronchitis annually.

                                                Unusual (reason for submission):  Blood 02 dropped to 94-96 the day after 2nd COVID vaccination.  I take O2 reading daily (generally).  Always been rock solid at 98 with maybe a 97 every two months.  This is really an outlier event.  Reading taken on six different fingers with one monitor reset.  Returned to 98 following day.  Other expected symptoms:   Temp 99.8  (generally 97.6 - 98.0).  Injection shoulder sore, felt puffy (but no visual difference).  Medium &#34;Brain Fog&#34; (senses seemed disconnected, lack of concentration).  Lethargic legs (not sore or weak, just slow to respond).  Left neck and ear aches.  Slept about 14 hours day after shot.  No symptoms other than sore arm the day of shot.  BP and blood sugars up, but at higher end of my normal ranges.  BP 175/93  (16th).  (at 149/93 on 17th). Blood stick reading 198 (16th).  (at 158 on 17th)

Within 2 more hours (5 from vaccine time), symptoms reduced to only low-level hissing equal across ears, i.e. tinnitus. During the 2 weeks since vaccine, hissing has remained exactly the same 24 hrs per day. Occasional much louder, higher frequency ringing has occured at least twice but only for short durations of 30 seconds.

I received the second shot 04/24/2021 at 1:00 p.m. and it seems to have gotten worse still. I have not sought treatment. Maybe the tinnitus is not related to the vaccine, or this is inconsequential, but I feel I have a responsibility to report it.

                                                A Week after my first dose ~ I had a rash all over my body 14 hours after my second dose.  I awoke to a very painful cramp about an inch below my left rib on my left side that lasted for almost 2 hours.  The more I moved, the worse it became.  I could not go to the bath room  and when I drank water, the cramp intensified.  Worse pain that I had ever experienced.  I sweated profusely.  Felt like I got kicked in the side.  I was not nauseous, a little dizzy for a moment.  My mouth was dry only because of my heavy breathing.     My second episode happened the following Saturday morning,  I don&#39;t think that it was as intense, but it felt like it was only because my left side was sour from Friday mornings episode.     My third and final episode happened again early Sunday morning.  This one was not as intense, but still woke me up and made me struggle.   I did not experience another episode on the 4 the night from my second dose.  At this time, my left side feels bruised internally and I have to change the speed of my walk.  It hurts to walk fast

I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today.

At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

                                                Before the COVID vaccine, I had a very mild case of tinnitus in the left ear. There was no discernible ringing, except occasionally at night in bed when it was quiet. One hour after the 1st COVID vaccine shot on March 2nd, there was extremely loud ringing in the left ear, which scared me terribly. It lasted about a minute. Whille the ringing is not as loud, there is constant ringing which overcomes everyday sound. For instance, when talking to people or watching television, the ringing is still heard. In addition, the ringing is often pulsating, which is a new experience for me.   Clearly, my tinnitus has gotten much worse as a result of the event.   I AM CONCERNED THE 2ND DOSE WILL MAKE THE RINGING WORSE.

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

                                                1.) Strong soreness in lower back and gut area. Hard to bend over. I don&#39;t typically suffer from back pain and didn&#39;t exert or do anything that might have strained muscles. Pain seems muscular in back and deep in lower gut/groin area in front.  2.) More concerning is the tinnitus or ear ringing I am experiencing. Very loud and unrelenting. Feels like ears need to be popped such as when air pressure changes. However, can&#39;t swallow hard or chew hard enough to clear ears. It&#39;s a bit flummoxing as it is unrelenting. Sounds like cicadas in my head.

I used to only be able to hear the ringing if the room was quiet and I actually listened for the tinnitus. Now I hear it all the time. Even so, it is not debilitating and can be ignored if there is extraneous noise and I am busy doing something that distracts me from it. So far it has not affected my sleep.

I would remain still and my vision would come back, first in the right eye and then the left eye.  It always happened the same way.  My left eye would begin to go black from the outside circumference to the middle, losing site, and then the right eye would start to do the same thing.  It hasnt happened again after that first month of reoccurrences, and it never happened before the shots.

                                                About a week after 1st injection an intensely loud ringing in my ears commenced.  The ringing has continued - non-stop - since its onset.  My hearing was considered excellent before the ringing started, as I was a professionally-trained ornithologist who could identify bird species by their vocalization - even very faint or distant calling.   Now, I have to concentrate to discern the identify of singing birds due to confounding din from the tinnitus.  Unfortunately, I did not realize that my recent onset of  tinnitus could be related to the covid-19 vaccine I had a week earlier, and I got my 2nd vaccination shot last Wednesday (4/21).  The ringing has continued unabated, and I am aware of it every waking moment.

He had his 2nd dose on 4/12/21 where he had the common symptoms but continued to have the ringing in the ears.  Today on 5/10/21 a month later he is still having trouble with his left ear.  He says it is completely plugged and  feels like there is water in it.  He will contact his PCP for medical advice.

                                                3 weeks after injection: Sudden onset of hearing loss in one ear, feeling of fullness/congestion in ear. Absolutely not a bacterial ear infection - no soreness/pain, redness, or discharge. Visited an ENT Dr. and inner ear issue confirmed. Hearing test showed significant loss or hearing (loudness) and loss of word discrimination.  Fri, 2-Apr: 1st COVID shot (Moderna). Slightly sore arm, no other symptoms/side-effects, all clear in 24 hrs. Fri, 23-Apr: Relatively rapid (over an hour or so) onset of hearing loss in left ear. Feeling of fullness in left ear, thought it might be congestion.  Sat, 24-Apr: No change/improvement in hearing of feeling of fullness in left ear. Sun, 25-Apr: I started to feel dizzy. I developed vertigo, though I did not get nauseous. Slept it off. Mon, 26-Apr: Awoke with no dizziness or vertigo. No change/improvement in hearing or feeling of fullness in left ear. Dizziness returned after dinner. Vertigo followed, more severe than the previous night. Unable to walk without help. Vomited and the nausea passed. Vertigo abated a bit, though still present. Slept it off. Tue, 27-Apr: Awoke with no dizziness or vertigo. No change/improvement in hearing of feeling of fullness in left ear Wed, 28-Apr: Saw ENT. First hearing test. Test confirmed quite a bit of hearing loss in left ear and some in the right ear. Thu, 29-Apr: 2nd COVID shot (Moderna). No side-effects until evening. Slight body ache, mild headache, maybe a mild fever. Some dizziness after eating. Fri, 30-Apr: Continued mild side-effects from COVID shot. Some dizziness after eating Sat, 1-May: Side-effects from COVID shot completely gone. Left ear noticeably worse. Sounds more attenuated, speech sounded more distorted. Sun, 2-May: No improvement in hearing Mon, 3-May: 2nd hearing test. Test confirmed significantly reduced hearing (volume) and speech recognition in left ear. Agreed to steroid injections to try to clear the suspected fluid retention/swelling. Tue: 4-May: 1st eardrum injection (10 mg dexamethasone) at 11:00 AM. No noticeable effect through bedtime. Wed, 5-May: Woke up with notably improved hearing in left ear (now only 10 or 20% attenuated). However, felt dizzy as soon as I woke up. Dizziness persisted until late afternoon. Thu, 6-May: No dizziness Fri, 7-May: 2nd eardrum injection (10 mg dexamethasone) at 11:30 AM. No noticeable effect through bedtime. Sat, 8-May: No improvement in left ear hearing, mildly dizzy when I woke up, dizziness persisted until late afternoon. Hearing not great in right ear over the course of the day (maybe 20% attenuated) Sun, 9-May: Minimal improvement in left ear hearing, if any. Right ear still partially impaired. A little light headed at times, no real dizziness. Mon, 10-May: Not dizzy when I woke up at 5:30 AM. Made a cup of coffee and ate an oat bran muffin at 6:15. Felt mildly dizzy by 6:30, persisted through the day and started to abate by evening. Tue, 11-May: No dizziness when I woke up. Hearing in left ear marginally improved. 3rd eardrum injection at 4:30 PM. Wed, 12-May: Woke up with improved hearing in left ear, still some attenuation, almost no distortion, still some feeling of fullness in the ear. No dizziness. Thu, 13-May: Woke up with hearing unchanged from Wed (i.e. no back-sliding). No dizziness in AM, though slightly lightheaded. Hearing degraded as the day progressed. Fri: 14-May: Woke up with hearing worse as compared to Thursday. Feeling of congestion/fullness in ears (more on the left than the right). Slightly lightheaded, no dizziness.

                                                17 days post vaccination as the first step in prep for a colonoscopy I experienced a reaction to the laxative Miralax, a 17 gram dose. First sneezing, the a flushed feeling accompanied by tingling and itching in hands and feet, the swelling of the lips, nose and tongue. The flushed feeling turned into a cold sweat and shaking.  These symptoms started within 20-25 minutes from ingesting the Miralax and lasted for about an hour and 30 minutes before they began to subside. The puffiness and some pain continued in my face until after midnight, the Miralax was taken approximately 5:45pm I cannot say for certain whether I have ever taken Miralax before, I think so as prep for another colonoscopy over 10 years ago but not certain on that. I am reporting this per my doctor&#39;s request.

                                                Symptoms are variable but some combination troubles me every day since March 6, excepting the twelve days I was on the Prednisone prescription.  In general, pain increases during sleeping hours, when I grow stiff and less flexible. I wake several times during the night (almost hourly) dry-mouthed. I don&#39;t know if pain wakes me or not. I rise with great difficulty and hobble to the bathroom.  Mornings are the worst part of the day, but I find if I keep moving, I loosen up and the general inflexibility goes away, and to some degree, so does the pain. It is never entirely gone. I also find that the pain seems to generally occur during movement and not at rest, although the pelvic pain and upper leg pain has and does occur while at rest.  The most regularly-occuring pain is hamstring and shoulder (shot locations). Rising from a laying or seated position has always been the most difficult.  Lately, pelvic pain has been rare, and knee pain intermittent.

Earache had intensified to a stabbing pain. Returned to same Urgent care and was diagnosed with shingles in my left ear. Left side of face had started to droop, particularly left side of mouth and jaw was sagging and swelling. Had lost hearing in left ear. This was if most concern since I already have hearing loss and wear hearing aids. Follow up visit with Audiologist revealed no additional hearing loss from previous tests. After changing medications

                                                Dizzy spells.  There have usually been other factors involved (extreme heat, exhaustion, alcohol) so I&#39;ve not worried about it.  However, in the same time frame I have begun to have a constant ringing in the ears.  The dizzy spells are getting worse and today lost me a job.  I mentioned it to one of the doctors when he was treating me for a sprained wrist that I got when a dizzy spell caused me to fall down.  He blamed the ringing on me being exposed to loud noises.  He said the dizzy spells were from drinking and smoking.  This was the first time I&#39;d ever seen this doctor and he gave me those diagnoses without any examination.

I visited my doctor today to ask for a hearing test and I&#39;ve been referred to Head and Neck Dept. I find myself having to use earbuds to listen to white noise during the day to try to drown out the ringing. I have no medication changes, no head injury, no loud noises. I am retired.

                                                Flushing and pressure feeling in my head/face and ringing in my ears increased immediately after injection. Then proceeded to get a slight noticeable increase in heart rate.   After setting for approximately 15 minutes I was released to leave. I mentioned to them that I just lived down the street and told them if I had any further issues or symptoms I would call them.  Approximately 30 minutes later I was having a slight lightning of the throat or airway and some slight tightness in breathing.  This tightness continued for approximately 2 hrs. I called the clinic and was attempting to get there recommendations but the nurse had left. I was told to get the ambulance personnel. As a prior EMT I felt that an ambulance was not needed at this time. I took 2 ea   Benadryl tablets and those symptoms lessened. Some numbness in lips and face, and felt heart beating in lips. That all subsided as well after taking Benadryl.  Still trying to get with a provider that could give me advise moving forward. The doctor was busy with an Emergency.

Dizziness     multiple times a day   Patient who presents to the emergency department today for evaluation of hypertension, head pain, blurry vision, and neck pain. He states about 6 months ago he had open heart surgery. Since that time he states that he has been having intermittent episodes of blurry vision usually lasts a few minutes and resolve on their own. Today however, he notes that the blurry vision lasted for greater than 5 minutes and he started to become concerned. During that time he also began to experience some pain in his neck and a headache in the back of his head. He took his blood pressure at that time and noted that his systolic blood pressure was in the 190s. This alarmed him and so they called EMS. When EMS arrived they rechecked his blood pressure again and his systolic blood pressure was over 200. Upon arrival here to the ER he states that he is feeling much better and his blood pressure appears to be better as well. At this time he states he still having some right shoulder pain and a little bit of right-sided neck pain but he does state that he had his Covid vaccine yesterday in his right arm. Currently patient states he still has a little bit of a posterior headache but it is much improved. He denies any fevers, body aches, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or swelling of the lower extremities. He has no known drug allergies.       ? ED Course: I discussed physical exam finding with patient. Apparently most of his symptoms have already resolved at this time. His blood pressure is back down to 142/98. I still advise since he was having some weird blurry vision I would like to get a CBC, CMP, troponin, EKG, and a chest x-ray. Patient agreeable to this plan of care. We will also continue to monitor his blood pressure to ensure that it does not spike back up.     Patient&#39;s work-up was unremarkable. His blood pressures down to 123/60 and states he is feeling much better. This point time it sounds like what happened was a hypertensive urgency. I advised him he needs to contact his PCP and schedule close follow-up discuss if anything further needs to be done. At this time though he is safe to be discharged home with strict return precautions.

As my fifteens was up , I started getting severe heightened sense of smell and could smell body odors from people all around me. Threw up before exiting building in rest room.Needed to get out of building ASAP fast for fresh air . Breathing-20 degree fresh air maskless helped but still felt weak so wife and medical aids brought me inside to isolated area on a cot to rest and take vitals .  When I was sick with COVID-19 in September 2020 I had same issues with heightened smell and taste before I lost them for three months.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

This presented itself as strong jaw pain like a bad cavity and soreness at the lymph node. I have a sore throat and have not been able to hardly chew or swallow without pain. This is still going on as of 3/3/21 but seems to be easing up a bit. I have a Dr. appointment on 2/9/21 to check it out.

                                                Began feeling very weak with a constant headache that later led to blurry vision on March, 2, 2021.  On the morning of March 4, 2021,  I was still experiencing a right sided headache as well as double vision.  I was no longer able to drive at that point.  I took my blood pressure digitally at the local pharmacy twice where it was 200/104.  I went home to call my physician and also have my wife take my blood pressure manually.  My blood pressure at that time was 214/106.  I went to the hospital where they examined me and then discharged me with a General Headache without a know cause.  I contacted my PCP and he advised me to quadruple my Lisinopril until my BP came down to normal range and see him the morning.  My visit the next day showed an elevated blood pressure, double vision, and a continuing headache.  My meds were adjusted to Lisinopril 10 mg qd and an addition of Norvasc 5 mg qd.  Later that day my blood pressure was down, but still not in the normal range.   The following day, March 6, 2021, I was still having the same issues despite the changes in medication.  I took my blood pressure at 6 pm and it was 199/104.  I immediately went to another hospital where I was admitted as  a &#34;stroke alert&#34; patient in hypertensive emergency.  I am presently being followed as an inpatient in order to get these issues under control.

                                                3 days after second injection of Moderna COVID vaccine my tinnitus increased in volume to a level I could barely hear and never experienced before.  It was difficult to sleep.   By morning the ringing had decreased in volume, more like I normally have.  I thought it might have been a coincidence, however my wife has now had a similar reaction to J&amp;J vaccine and I have seen others reporting the same issue. My prior reaction to the first and second shots were soreness at the injection site which resolved after 4-5 days.

Patient&#39;s wife called back 2 hours later around 12:43pm  and said the patient noticed a metallic taste in his mouth about 15 minutes after his vaccination.  No other adverse issues.  I called patient back around 2:15pm and he was resting with no other issues per consult with wife.    Advised patient&#39;s wife to seek immediate medical attention if any other adverse events developed (rash, swelling, itching, tickle in throat any difficulty breathing,  facial drooping or anything out of the ordinary).    Also advised patients wife to contact us if there were any changes or if the patient had to seek medical treatment.

Have had a high pitched ringing or hissing in ears since receiving the vaccine; did not make the connection to the vaccine because tinnitus was not disclosed as a side effect, and no questions about this side effect were raised in follow up surveys. Yesterday, while reading an article about someone, committing suicide, I saw a reference to tinnitus.  Only now do I see many reports online of this side effect.

The patient&#39;s medical history included COPD, congestive heart disease and chronic problems with his back. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 4 Jan 2021, 17 days prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot batch: 026L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021 the patient had an unexpected reaction. He got up that morning and felt fine, but as the day went on, he noticed that when he spoke, the left side of his mouth was not moving, then he noticed his left eye was not closing and that side of his face was drooping. He was not in any pain at that point. He made an appointment to see his general doctor the next day, 22 Jan 2021, after the exam he was diagnosed him with Bell&#39;s Palsy (BP) and referred him to a neurologist and ophthalmologist. The earliest he could see the ophthalmologist back was next week and he could not get the neuro to call him back. His doctor prescribed him prednisone which he completed after 7 days but said the BP symptoms have not improved. Then on Saturday, 30 Jan 2021, he started feeling extreme pain behind his left ear. Everyday the pain got worse. His pain medications were not helping the pain behind his left ear. He could not see out of his left eye and he could not blink. The event left side of his face was drooping was considered as medically significant.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events left side of his face was drooping, extreme pain behind his left ear, can&#39;t blink, and his left eye was not closing was not provided.   The events left side of his face was drooping, extreme pain behind his left ear, can&#39;t blink, and his left eye was not closing was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Patient is historically very symptomatic with his PVCs. These worsened over the course of a week which lead to worsening substernal chest pain and he presented to the ER on 3/15/2021 and due to his history of CAD, was hospitalized for observation, discharged on 3/16/2021. He had labs, echocardiogram while in the hospital. His metoprolol was increased to help decrease symptomatic PVCs. On 3/9/2021, patient developed chills, difficulty swallowing and the sensation of his throat and tongue being swollen, along with some generalized itching. He presented to the ER 3/9/2021 due to these symptoms and these symptoms resolved without interventions and he was discharged home. He then developed lower lip swelling on 3/15/2021.

                                                Approximately 12 hrs after the vaccine injection I experiences mild flu like symptoms. The flu like symptoms went away around 24 hrs after the injection. The following morning around 3:00 AM I woke up with severe lateral movement. I was not able to walk, experienced severe vertigo and nausea. These symptoms began to reduce 24 hrs later. At this point double vertical vision began and lasted for approximately one week. Currently I have mild vertigo 18 days after the injection. I am able to drive safely and the vertigo symptoms are reducing day by day.

After some research, I learned that Tinnitus is a rare but known side effect primarily for Moderna but also for Pfizer Covid vaccine. The whistling sound is not extremely loud but it&#39;s definitely there and has made sleeping at night difficult. Twelve days later, it still there and it&#39;s quite bothersome. It gives me pause to take the second dose scheduled for April 29.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine on March 11, 2021. Ten days later, on March 21, i noticed the first hives on my legs. By March 23, the hives had spread across my body and the injection site on my left arm was inflamed. I went to the doctor&#39;s office and the prescribed Benadryl and Hydrocortosone cream. Five days later, the hives were still active and my upper lip swelled up. I contacted my doctor&#39;s office via a tele-medical call and they prescribed Allegra and Zyrtec also. By April 5, the swelling of my upper lip had gone down and my injection site was better, but the hives were still all over my body. I went back to the doctor&#39;s office and they precscribed Prednizone  as well. After taking prednizone  for 5 days and other medication for seven days I was able to stop all medications without the return of the hives.

                                                Tinnitus was at a manageable level, like crickits in background, After the shot, a high pitch ringing started and it has not stopped. I will not take the 2nd shot due to not knowing  how worse the tinnitus might elevate. I have had tinnitus for approx 2.5 years ( with some hearing loss ), but I have been able to train my brain to handle this. The tinnitus is 24x7, non stop, only relief is when you actually get to sleep. It&#39;s been a bigger issue to deal with since I took the Moderna shot. Had I known it would have affected tinnitus, I would not have taken the 1st shot. My daughter advised me to google moderna/tinnitus. I did and read all the reports on that. I wish I had read that first. I looked at the list of side effects, tinnitus was not on the list, so it never occurred to me it would be an issue. It is a big issue when you deal with it everyday of your life.

                                                I want to be really clear. Within 6 hours after the 2nd shot, I developed extreme fatigue. By about 9 pm, I experienced chills, moderate muscle cramps and headache. I expected this might happen based on news reports and articles of same. By about 6 pm the next day, these symptoms completely resolved and I felt perfectly fine. Sometime within the next week (I estimated date/time), I developed a high-pitched ringing in my left ear. On May 30th, I saw my primary care doctor who prescribed Montelukast; and told me to continue my OTC Zyrtec and Flonase Sensimist. In addition, he suggested OTC Sudafed, which I have not started as it makes me anxious and disturbs my sleep. I have never before had tinnitus and the onset was sudden.

                                                Site of injection (left shoulder) was slightly sore after about 4 or 5 hours.  Shot was administered at 8:05AM.  Felt fine until about 6:45PM.  Noticed aches and painst beginning in neck, shoulders, and a slight headache which came and went.  at 8PM, was very tired and began to feel somewhat lightheaded.  Went to bed and felt chills.  Awakened six or seven times during the night to urinate.  Was a little dizzy each time I rose from the bed.  Also felt feverish and took my temperature.  It was elevated to 99.3F, which for me is definitely elevated, since it is usually no higher than 98.6 and is often around 97.9F.   Felt very tired the next morning and had continued mild aches and pains and occaisional shingles-like stabbing pains in rotator cuff of left arm , mastoid bone behind right and left ears, and occaisional  random stabbing pains in earl lobes.  The pains were mild to moderate on occaision.  Left arm was a little sore during movement, especially near the shoulder.  Felt very tired throughout the day and went to bed at 8PM the day after the shot.   That evening in to nightime when I would get up to go to the bathroom, I began to feel better and after midnight of the second day, I felt pretty much back to normal.  The lightheadedness, aches and pains, and tiredness all went away by the morning .   I would also report that I ate normally during these effects and did not suffer any nausea or feel like vomiting at any time.

                                                A few hours after my second shot I got a mild headache, tired, and a bit blurry vision. The next day things got worse with high fever, bad headache, and very tired. The bad side effects went away after 4 days but since then I often feel tired with a mild headache and a little chest pain now and then. Before my vaccination, I played tennis 3 times a week, each time I played  about 2 to 3 hours continuously without feeling tired. But after the vaccination, it takes only 15 to 30 minutes for me to run out of breath so I have to slow down to catch my breaths. My stamina is adversely effected after my vaccination . I&#39;m afraid that I have a case of Myocarditis, a condition similar to Pericarditis, which is an inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart, that caused by the vaccine.

I immediately had trouble breathing with the feeling that my throat was closing.  That&#39;s when the EMT&#39;s took me to the ambulance  and gave me an injection and other treatment  that I can not remember and then I was transferred to the hospital.   At the hospital I received more meds and within a short time other then being tired I felt  better.  I went home and went to bed a slept to the next morning.

By March 23, the hives had spread across my body and the injection site on my left arm was inflamed. I went to the doctor&#39;s office and he prescribed Benadryl and Hydrocortosone cream. Five days later, the hives were still active and my upper lip swelled up. I contacted my doctor&#39;s office via a tele-medical call and they prescribed Allegra and Zyrtec also. By April 5, the swelling of my upper lip had gone down and my injection site was better, but the hives were still all over my body. I went back to the doctor&#39;s office and they precscribed Prednizone  as well. After taking prednizone  for 5 days and

Both arms had sparse, red spots on them.  On the side of his left eye he had it was a little red and looked a little swollen. He stated they itched some and his &#34;itch&#34; pills at home did not help (he could not tell me the name of them). He did state that about 3 weeks ago he had taken some steroid pills for poison ivy. He did not fill them at this pharmacy and could not tell me the name of them. He said the spots and the swelling on his eye were worse in the mornings. Told pt I would contact his primary care doctor tomorrow and he said he would as well.

                                                About one hour after the shot I experienced a very mild, but noticeable, tingling sensation on my lips/mouth.  I did not notice any tingling on my tongue or throat, or anywhere else on my body.  The tingling sensation  last about three hours and never recurred.

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

The sensation lasted for about 15 minutes then completely subsided.  About 4 hours later upon retiring to bed before falling asleep, I began to experience a abnormal sound in both my ears.  I covered my ears and the sound remained unchanged.  I do suffer tinnitus and am used to ringing in my ears.  This was more of a rushing metallic sound similar to the rushing water but high pitched and metallic.  This anomaly lasted for around 30 minutes.

                                                I had very severe cf starting in 1996.  It remained severe for approximately 5 years after which it was semi acute for another 5 years.    After that i would have periodic relapses several times a year for varying lengths of time.  For the last 10 years irt has been much better with occasional symptoms.  However i received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine on february 23, 2021 and had a strong flu like response.  I am now experiencing a mild to moderate relapse of my cf.   brain fog, difficulty tracking with my vision, chills, etc.  when i had severe cf i had this symptom where my scalp would feellike it was in a spasm.  That has returned.  I have dealt with tcf long enough to know when it occurs and this is definitely a response to the covid vaccine.

                                                He complained of dizziness the evening of the shot.  He went to bed and when he woke up the next morning he was having double vision.  Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

The pharmacist was called and the patient reported feeling  light headed and dizzy. While talking the pharmacist the patients eyes rolled back in his head. The pharmacist held his shoulders and his hand and continued to speak to the patient. He regained consciousness. The patient was able to move to his knees and then to lie on his back on the floor with his feet elevated. The injection site was clear and smooth. He had no fever. After resting 15 minutes his color improved and was conversing well. He was able to sit up and his blood pressure was taken. His blood pressure was within normal range. He sat for another 15 min and drank some juice. He was feeling well enough to go home in the care of his wife.

I assumed these were  some of the symptoms as a result of the vaccine. I monitored my fever for several hours. The cough persisted for the next 9 plus days and I didn&#39;t have any desire to eat or drink liquids. I lost my taste and smell during this 9 day period. On February 25 my wife and I took a Covid-19 self test at pharmacy. Also on this same date I went to urgent care My wife was concerned about my labored breathing.  My vitals were checked and I requested a chest xray. I was given 2 prescriptions. 1 for Prednisone 20mg and Ventolin.

I hit the ground on the right side of my head which effected my left ear and a lot of hearing loss.

While in transit he did require an additional dose of Epi. Once in the ER he was treated with steroids and Benadryl and was discharged later that same day.

                                                I developed severe tinnitus after receiving the second Moderna vaccine and it has not subsided. It&#39;s interfering with my daily life and has adversely affected the quality of my life. Today I&#39;m going to see an ENT doctor for evaluation. Now I see and hear that many people are experiencing the same loud ringing tinnitus after receiving the Moderna vaccine.  I can only make the correlation that the loud ringing that goes on 24/7 began after getting the vaccinations.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (10 day hospitalization and administration of oxygen therapy) on 01-Nov-2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension and Diabetes mellitus.    On 02-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). In March 2021, the patient experienced BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to AGEUSIA, CONSTIPATION, DYSSTASIA, GAIT DISTURBANCE and POLLAKIURIA, and then from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to ASTHENIA. On 06-Mar-2021, GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) had resolved. On 24-Mar-2021, ASTHENIA (weakness), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) and AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) had resolved. At the time of the report, POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination), BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter. Treatment History includes ER visit, hospitalization, IV fluids, IV medications, &#34;injections for blood sugar&#34;, EKG, scope to check for blood clots, physical therapy.

                                                Increased ringing of the ears (tinnitus) and flare up of fibromyalgia. Approximately 2 ½ hours after vaccine dose was administered. For the next couple of days, I am monitoring to see if the flare up will subside. This was my first dose of the vaccine.

                                                He got his vaccine, within 24 hours later he had hives, his lips and face swelled up, he had a low grade temp of 99.8 having chills and wanting to stay warm and lay in bed with multiple  blankets.  After his daughter noticed it about 2 hours later they went to the ER, and they gave him a steroid, Benadryl and a steroid and gave him IV Pepcid until the swelling went down and he felt better.   They gave him 6 days worth of Benadryl, and steroids which he did take for that.  After 6 days and after 24 hours he broke again in the same manner and they told him that it was okay as long as he was breathing well.  He then went to the UC and he bought OTC Benadryl which he continued.  Then exactly 30 days after he went to the ER on 4/24/21 he broke again with the lips swelling, hives, temperature was normal but feeling achy and the same symptoms he had from the beginning.  He went to his PCP and he has him now on steroids, Benadryl and the Pepcid when needed as well.  He takes the Benadryl as needed and then the symptoms subside and the reaction comes back.   If he does not do the Benadryl until later this evening then his lips will start tightening and then swell.

                                                MY tinnitus had been an afterthought after a few years when it first occurred in 2004.  Soon after the 2nd moderna vaccine, it has gotten progressively worse.  Met with my ENT a few days ago and he informed me he has had numerous patients complain about tinnitus after receiving a COVID vaccine.  Some of my friends and relatives have also mentioned the same thing.  The ringing in left ear is constant and is getting worse.  Since a hearing test on 5/26 showed I have &#34;Asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss, unilateraL, with restricted hearing on contralateral side&#34;, he has ordered a &#34;MRI BRAIN&#43;INTERNAL AUDITORY CANAL, W/WO CONTRAST.  My MRI appt is 6/3.

Altered sensation was bilateral and described as his tongue and lips felt heavy and swollen. Did not see any swelling, however. Had difficulty talking, eating and drinking and compared it to having the face numb after having dental work done. This altered sensation resolved by the next day and pt. reports back to 100% of normal. He has always had tinnitus but states his ears have been ringing a lot more since his first Covid vaccine.

There was hyperacusis with tinnitus.  The tinnitus has continued for 3 months. Also the vaccine has caused my wife to mumble. I can hear her speaking, but have to ask her to repeat herself - this is a daily occurrence.  Previously I had mild tinnitus that was only audible in quiet situations when I was inactive (laying in bed before falling asleep. It is now constant.

                                                About six minutes after the vaccination, while sitting in the clinic, I experienced a feeling like I was about to lose consciousness, together with salivary gland activation and heavier breathing.  This lasted about one minute and I did not pass out.  But about 25 minutes later, while driving home (alone), I experienced the same thing but for about 5 or 6 minutes.  Fortunately I didn&#39;t pass out.  About an hour after the shot I felt sort of back to normal.

No, I have never had lip fillers, botox or other lip injections. My care provider prescribed a 6 day steroid pack. The swelling stopped  and reversed shortly after the first dose was taken. My inner lip skin healed and was normal after 5 days. I would like to know if your recommendation as to whether I should get the second shot or not?

When I finally opened them everything looked crystallized, I couldn?t see the tv which was on but it was brighter in that area, I couldn?t make out anything. I closed my eyes for a few minutes and opened them with the same results. I closed my eyes about 4 times and then finally I could make out everything .  The only thing different that I took was the vaccine and a packet of Thera Flu.    Nothing else has happened since except a sore arm which lasted 4 days

Took another 24 hours for headache to go away. Cough still exists. Still little appetite. Things that I normally would like, I don&#39;t want or don&#39;t taste just right. Having to force myself to eat. It was worse than when I actually had Covid-19 in March 2020.

                                                Significant increase in tinnitus starting about 10 days after the injection. First observed in right ear and then in the left ear. This is a long time 20 year sufferer of tinnitus. The observation is a very significant change in the level experienced.  Concerned about having the second injection and impact it would have on quality of life if this does not subside.

He wasn&#39;t able to speak for 3 days.  On 2/17/2021 he went to the hospital.  They thought he may have Bell&#39;s Palsy so the they did a XRAY and CT.  They were not able to find anything other than facial swelling so he was discharged and told to come back if he did not get better and they would make him an appt w/ an ENT.  He started taking Aleve.  He no longer has constant pain but his mouth still hurts when he opens it.  He will contact his PCP to let her know what happened and to let her know that he will not be taking his 2nd covid vax dose.

                                                Narrative:  67 year-old male received his 1st COVID vaccine dose at a clinic on 2/25/21 at ~ 11:45am. No known prior COVID infection. No history of vaccine allergies or allergies to any component of the COVID vaccine. Does have history of allergic reactions including hives, angioedema or anaphylaxis to some medications (neomycin, Neosporin, bacitracin) and environmental allergens (yellow jackets, fir trees). Patient reported previously daily use of diphenhydramine (2 caps every morning) and kept an epi-pen on hand. The afternoon of 2/26/21, patient presented to his neighbor&#39;s house requesting assistance with an epi-pen. Neighbor reported significant swelling around tongue and lips, and ability to faintly speak. Neighbor administered epi-pen, but unsure if it worked, so administered a 2nd epi-pen. Within a minute or two after the 2nd dose, patient slumped over and became non-responsive. EMS was called and neighbor began CPR. EMS reported that patient was non-responsive upon arrival. A King airway was placed and a Lucas device used for chest compressions. Three rounds of epinephrine were administered during transport to the local emergency room. Patient remained unresponsive with evidence of PEA during transport. Arrival at the ER occurred ~ 4:25pm. On arrival patient noted to be unresponsive with CPR in progress. Dose of epinephrine administered ~ 3 minutes after arrival in ER. No femoral pulse palpable, cardiac monitor did show some electrical activity. Evaluation of oral cavity showed significant swelling of tongue. Additional dose of epinephrine given. Patient remained with no palpable central pulse and showed continued evidence of PEA. Patient was estimated to have been down &gt; 45 minutes. Patient pronounced deceased at 4:59pm.

                                                12 days after his second Moderna COVID vaccine, my father developed Shingles. His left eyelid is incredibly swollen and his right eyelid began to swell today. That is his only symptom. He?s on an antiviral and gabapentin. He had received both doses of his shingles vaccines about 3 years prior. We have no idea if related to COVID vaccine but wanted to make you all aware.

Headache, right side only, started same day at 7:30 PM, sore shoulder at vaccine site about 10:30 PM same day.  Both were gone the next morning.  I recd the second dose of the moderna vaccine 3-13-2021 at 11 AM.  By 2 PM I had a ranging head ache, again right side only.  I drove four hours to the vaccination site, hospital.  I was driving home when this started.  I stopped to purchase Tylenol about 3 pm which it turns out had no effect.  I was driving west into a setting sun, as the headache got worse, my eyes became more and more sensitive to the sun, I stopped a second time to purchase a second pair of sunglasses that I could wear over the first pair, that didn?t help, I ended up stopping at a rest area until the sun set.  I got to my house at about 6 PM, by then I could no longer wear my prescription glasses, besides the headache I was now very dizzy.  At about 9 PM the pain started, between my shoulder blades first, never at the injection site.  From that time on, including today, the pain has constantly moved around my body, the worst pain is associated with areas that arthritis affects me, hips, knees, hands, ankles.  I have had a mild fever, ranging from 100.9 Saturday night to 100.3 now at11 AM 3-15-2021.  Yesterday, 3-14, my head was swearing, my feet were ice cold.  I had an electric blanket from my waist down and an ice pack on head.  If I have ever felt worse in my life I don?t remember when that would have been.  The pain has moderated today, I expect the worst is now over.    If as the health specialists are suggesting a booster will be required this fall I will undoubtedly have incredibly significant reservations with this vaccine.

About one week after the second dose I noticed that the ringing in my ears is much louder, probably a four or five. I can think of no other reason other than the vaccine for this to occur.   The increased volume has not subsided over the past four days.  I have not required medical attention for this event.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                Started getting ringing in my ears about 5 or 6 days after getting my second injection of the Moderna vaccine on March 7th. I received the first injection on February 7th. I didn&#39;t notice any side effects  from the first shot other than minor soreness in the injection site of my left arm. I had minor soreness with the second shot as well but it was less than the first. I did take two 400 mg Anacin plus caffeine (32mg) 3 days before my second shot for a sinus headache I  had at the time. I am going to see my ear, nose and throat doctor this Friday 3/26 to have him check me out and maybe get a hearing test if he thinks it&#39;s necessary.

                                                My first Covid-19 vaccination was on February 2, 2021. I had little or no side effects with pain at  the exception of pain at the injection site, and minor body aches for two days.  My second Covid-19 vaccination was on March 5, 2021. I experienced a terrible headache, nausea, bodyaches, slight fever, and chills. These symptoms lasted for 3-4 days.  A couple days later I began to hear a hissing sound in my right ear. There is nothing I can do to eliminate  it, and it continues today.  Sometimes it?s soft, and sometimes it?s very loud, but always constant. I reported it to my family doctor on March 23, 2021.

The reaction lasted for 2-3 days after the first injection.   After the second shot the tinnitus started about the same time after the shot but was louder, pulsating, and has not let up at all.  I am still suffering from this now.  The current outcome is that I will be seaking additional medical care if this does not improve.

Intermittent urinary discomfort, which improved briefly then returned and culminated in passage of a small amount of blood. Was seen in ED for that, and confirmed to have RBC in urine, but CT abd/pelvis negative, CBC normal. Was told evaluation normal but may need to see urology. He thinks may have passed small kidney stone.  Ten days later, continues with fevers (subjective - has no thermometer), chills, body aches, joint pain, headaches.  Axillary swelling has decreased in size but he feels a pain deeper inside at that area. Pain &amp; fever improve with tylenol but both return when it wears off. No further urinary symptoms.  No rashes No recent travel Feels a little pressure in his chest to breathe, but no difficulty breathing.  Never had cough No contact with COVID positive (or suspected positive) person - has only been at home.  Was offered COVID test in ED but declined due to did not feel he was at risk of having come in contact with it.

                                                Patient started to get a twitching of the eye and some mouth tightening and loosening two days after vaccine.  He went in and was seen by the physician twice.  The first time was for a CT and other blood tests to ensure he didn&#39;t have a stroke.  The second appointment was to tell him that it wasn&#39;t a stroke and nothing else was wrong, so they assumed it was the vaccine.  He also went to the eye doctor during this time to ensure that it wasn&#39;t going to affect his stigmatism due to the fact that he couldn&#39;t wear his contacts only his glasses and his stigmatism is so bad he has to wear hard contacts.  Due to the twitching he couldn&#39;t wear the contacts.  It was reported to us on 04/08/2021 and he was still have some eye twitching, but not bad and his mouth symptoms had pretty much resolved.

                                                He got the vaccine, when she gave him the shot if felt like liquid fire going in, it was then fine.  Two hours later the arm started swelling up and got so swollen he could hardly move the shoulder.  Then it started moving into the shoulder quadrant, as far as your fingers can spread, all the way back onto the back itself.  It then traveled up to the neck, to the spine to the ear in that quadrant and stops at the knot behind the ear.  The pain is so bad that you press on the knot behind the ear the headache will go away.  The headache is so intense  it feels like it&#39;s going to blow off and takes migraine headache medicine which does not help it.  It now has caused vision issues, he cannot read/blurry vision with large print things close up.  He can see fine 5&#39; or further with no problems, but nothing up close and he can&#39;t drive due to this or use the computer as he can&#39;t see the keyboard to type.  The pain has continued even up until today, 4/14/21.   The shot area is fine now.   Originally when the symptoms started he could not turn his head as it hurt so bad, and has taken all this amount of time to actually turn his head some, but cannot turn it to the left much.  He can gently and slowly turn his head but it is painful.  He has gone to his doctor and went to the COVID clinic with the first vaccine who want to see him to a neurologist.

This is my right arm, not the left arm where I received the second dose. I was having trouble sleeping at night and I was having a stabbing sensation in my ear. I had a toothache in my mouth on the right side. They gave me amoxicillin. The tooth pain went away, and my ear did to a few days later. The pain in my arm did not go away. I went to the ER and they told me I might have carpal tunnel syndrome. They gave me steroids.  I also have a tingling sensation in my fingers. My normal doctor told me I had the symptoms of a pinched nerve, but they didn&#39;t think it was a pinched nerve, but nerve damage. I went to a neurologist. I was having so much pain in my arm that I was having trouble sleeping. The neurologist said they would have to run tests.

                                                Felt fine after injection, walked 5 miles home &amp; assured loved ones before going to bed that vaccination went fine with no side effects. After midnight I woke in the dark with many of the same symptoms as when I had COVID in March/April 2020: extreme allover body aches, terrible thirst, extreme weakness.  Next day (Wednesday) symptoms continued; too weak &amp; achy to watch all but the core parts of the inauguration; too uncomfortable to read or to concentrate on music or anything else.  Absolutely no appetite so I didn&#39;t eat.  Wednesday night I tossed &amp; turned all night with a chill that I couldn&#39;t lose even with the heaviest down comforter &amp; supplementary blankets.  That night &amp; the following day I also noticed a distorted sense of time, where hours seem to pass v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y.  On Thursday night two more symptoms appeared: a tremendous cough that I couldn&#39;t stop or assuage with the normal remedies (e.g., lozenges, tea with honey), and that kept me from falling asleep till dawn; and diarrhea (which was limited because I hadn&#39;t eaten since Monday dinner so I didn&#39;t have much food in my system).  The cough felt like it might develop into a sore throat (which had been my first symptom when I had COVID) but it never did.  Yesterday (Friday) I felt as if my symptoms (other than residual weakness) were abating, and Friday night I got a full night of unbroken sleep.  I awoke on Saturday morning with no symptoms, and felt well enough to challenge myself by attempting my usual 90-minute yoga/stretch workout, which proved to be no problem.  Now, at 4 pm on Saturday--about 100 hours after my shot--I feel fairly normal &amp; seem to have no further symptoms.  I do plan to lie low &amp; take things easy, and to have as little outside contact as possible between now and my second shot (scheduled for 2/16) in order to minimize the possibility of re-infection.

HCP approached vehicle where a 68yo white male was sitting in his vehicle on the driver side. Quick assessment revealed erythema of the face and angioedema. Pt was able to speak clearly, was CTA and had RRR. 911 was called. BP 160/90.  EpiPen dose 1 was injected into right vastus lateralis and pt reported improvement at 1057.  HCP asked for injectable diphenhydramine. HCP continued to monitor pt with RRR and CTA but erythema and angioedema began again along with swollen tongue so EpiPen dose 2 was injected into right vastus lateralis. 50mg IM diphenhydramine was injected into the right deltoid while fire rescue began to arrive on scene. Pt did not report difficulty breathing. Pt did report previous anaphylaxis to fire ant bites/stings and did report being allergic to bee stings. Fire rescue transported patient without difficulty. HCP called pt later that night at 2030 who reported doing better but still having tongue swelling.

                                                Neck pain near the top of the neck at the base of the skull slightly to the right of the center began around Feb 1. Began taking Ibuprofin, but it did not go away.  Thought I had muscle strain, but surprisingly there was no stiffness or loss of motion. Tried massage, heat, and cold packs with limited relief. Began interfering with sleep over the next few days. On the evening of Feb 4, I noticed a strange sensation on the right side of my tongue as if I was losing taste or feeling there. At 3 AM got out o bed due to neck pain and noticed right eye felt strange and was drooping. When I got up at 8 AM I saw eye droop and smile was only on one side of mouth. Called my doctor and was directed to an advice nurse who told me to go to the ER right away, since this could be a stroke or Bell&#39;s Palsy. Went to ER and was diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy after blood tests, EKG, CT scan, and tests of limbs. Given medications and and released with prescriptions sent to CVS for prednisone and valacyclovir.

                                                Beginning about 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I started having really bad headaches, behind my eyes radiating to the back of the head. At about   15 hours post vaccine I had chills, fever. The chills and fever were bad enough that in addition to sleeping under two blankets I had to put on a thick fleece ?hoodie? and pulled the hoodie over my head. I developed about 48 hrs of nasal congestion, and some retrosternal chest pain. I had one episode of nausea with vomiting about 8:00 am the next morning. I had to take two 325 mg Tylenol every 4-6 hrs to deal with the headache and fever. The most severe symptoms of  headache and fever subsided in about 24 to 36 hrs after the vaccine was administered. I had a lot of fatigue for several days, along with aches and pains. It took me about 5 days to really start feeling normal again, but the fatigue lingered for a few more days.

Patient called around 3:30 PM to state he may be experiencing &#34;itchy tongue&#34; and &#34;scratchy throat&#34;, which started about 15 minutes after he left the store (~30 min post vaccine).  He reported no other signs/sx at the time. He was advised to seek immediate medical attention since wife was with him, he&#39;s ~5 min from local hospital, and no other severe sx were currently present. However, he was advised to contact 911 if any severe reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, passing out, etc.) appears. Pt said he would discuss this with his wife, and we discussed that an allergic reaction can progress quickly. He said he has benadryl on hand, but we discussed that benadryl will not be enough if patient does develop a severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis. Patient was advised to contact his on-call Dr. for a second opinion at the very least if he does not go to the ED and to continue monitoring for additional signs/sx of allergic reaction. Patient was advised to follow up with us in a few days for update.

Felt like I blacked out for 2 seconds and was drolling.  This is the only time that I have experienced this.

Symptoms were not severe.  I just wanted to make you aware of them, since I understand that it is rare to have symptoms after the first dose (which this was).   I was not in any place or around any people to be exposed to a oold or flu virus.

But his memory was a bit off for the next 6 hours. It took him 3 tries to get his wife&#39;s name correct. Briefly he didn&#39;t know where he was and did not recognize his cat. So he went to the ER.

I quickly took Benadryl and a few hours later it started to get back to normal. It did not hurt or anything but slowly got back to normal. The next day 02/112/2021 I was itching on the right side of my stomach and had a big red bump. I kept taking Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for the next 7 days because otherwise as soon as i stopped taking the medicine I would have itching and bumps in my arms and side of my stomach. I had my lips swollen, my right eye lid droop. I still have episodes of itching and bumps  16 days after vaccine

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

He chose not to take medication to treat. He did lose approximately 4 lbs which he has regained.   I didn&#39;t connect the two immediately but a close friend of mine who is a nurse - her sister had also had a similar event in close relation to having received the moderna vaccine - I&#39;ve encouraged her to report as well.   I hope this information is helpful.

                                                Pt has a history of CVA and aspiration pneumonia in Feb 2021. Pt had been on olanzapine since 2/24 at Institute.  He was given his second Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on 03/10/21. Per note on 3/12, pt had seizure like symptoms at 0545 for approx. 45 seconds (eye rolling, lack of response, increased confusion)  Per staff, there was no flexing of limbs or loss of bowel or bladder control.  No noted stroke like symptoms but he appeared more confused at neuro check.  Pt was back to baseline at 15 min neuro check.  Pt reported to have had additional seizure, of approx. 4 minutes duration, during morning report that day-but when MD got to his room, he appeared ?post ictal with a mildly agitated restless delirium? rolling back and forth on the floor, moaning, and not making eye contact.  Pt did lose control of his bladder. Olanzapine was discontinued on 3/12, due to potential to lower the seizure threshold.  Divalproex was initiated for seizures.  Per note 3/22-no additional seizure type symptoms have occurred.

                                                A couple of weeks after getting the 2nd Moderna vaccine I started noticing a strange uncommon smell. it did not smell like anything I had smelled before. For a while I thought it was something in the house  like a pest that died in the wall, or liquid spill that i wasn&#39;t aware of. Eventually I realized that certain things around the house would intensify the smell such as coffee or liquid hand soap. The smell of these items was being altered to smell like something else. As of this date I still have this symptom, although it  varies from day to day. My taste seems ok.

A diagnosis of sudden severe sensorineural hearing loss was confirmed by both audiologist and MD ENT specialist. Hearing aid is no longer of benefit and treatment plan includes a future unilateral cochlear implant for my right ear.

Then some 4 hours latter, dramatically reduced stamina, with onset of fatigue which lead to sleeping the next 72 to 84 hours and only being able to get up out of bed to urinate.  Body aches and sore injection arm during this time about 2 days total.  Used a Far Infrared heating pad to help mitigate the symptoms; unsure if it helped.  In the first 5 days, very weak and feeble feeling, physically and mentally (cognitively speaking).  Saw my doctor after that.

                                                Took the shot, after waiting the allotted time my left eye began to feel abnormal and then I began seeing black wavy lines, the situation continued about 10 minutes, then my eye seemed alright but as my vision adjusted everything was blurry and distorted.  The following morning I realized I also had a floater in my eyesight.   Over the next several days I realized my central vision was distorted and was having a hard time reading.  I made an appt. with the Eye Glass Doctor thinking new glasses were needed, after seeing him he made an appt with the Opthamologist.  I saw him and he explained I had cataracts and that I needed to see a retina specialist, which I did, he thought my eye under the macula was swollen and sent me to a surgeon, after several test from these doctors they have all agreed there is a hole in my macula that was not there prior to the shot.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                Patient reported hand tingling shortly after his vaccination. Patient has a history of colorectal cancer has has reported previous incidents with this same sensation, mostly after his chemo infusions. He states that the sensations start in his hands and eventually progress to other limbs and even his head. Patient states that currently he is having tingly feeling on both hands and on his head, at the same time. Patient denies tongue swelling, trouble swallowing, trouble speaking or trouble breathing. He has never had a vaccine reaction or an anaphylactic reaction before. Patient appeared diaphoretic upon interview and vasovagal. He was instructed to remove his jacked and denied a cool compress.  Patient waited an extra 15 minutes (30 total) and was still experiencing symptoms. Patient instructed to utilize Benadryl if symptoms continued and to call 911 and/or go to the ER if he experienced any trouble breathing. Patient explained that the tingly feelings progressed to the sides of his tongue, however he still denied trouble speaking, trouble swallowing, trouble breathing, swelling, and salivation.  Patient was offered an ambulance but refused. Wife was accompanying patient and stated that she would continue to monitor him and would be able to drive him to the ER if necessary. Patient&#39;s symptoms seemed to be improving as well. Ultimately, patient was counseled to f/u with primary care for questions regarding second dose and was advised to go to the ER if symptoms progressed or worsened.

                                                After 2 days of shaking chills, sweats, fever to 103, and myalgia, I had an acute and devastating flare of trigeminal neuralgia that left me unable to speak or swallow (due to pain) and with me dripping in sweat (again, due to the unbearable pain of the feeling of a razor blade slicing the underside and left side of my tongue) for 12 hours.  I got things under control by increasing the TEGRETOL dosage and adding gabapentin.  BP 125/75 P69 T99.0.  I have controlled this disease for 20 years and I never have had an event like this. I can only assume the inflammatory component of the reaction to the vaccine activated the neuralgia.

The burning sensation was more intense after the second injection compared to the first.

On Tuesday March 16 I awoke and could not focus my eyes: I was seeing double.  This got better during the course of the day but I could not work on my computer.  On Wednesday March 17, I woke with double vision again.  During the day I gradually became able to focus if I looked at an object, but as soon as I move my eyes, it was back to double vision.  I felt much better physically that day.

                                                Have had tinnitus for a number of years, but the volume has always been at a reasonable level such that it was never disabling.  I was awakened on the morning of March 24th by considerably louder tinnitus ringing in both ears and was unable to sleep thereafter.  This condition persisted throughout the day, causing significant stress and anxiety and making normal function extremely difficult.  That night, I was unable to sleep at all.  Though the volume has diminished somewhat, it is still close to being at a debilitating level, making normal function exceedingly difficult.  Receiving the vaccine was the only change in my normal routine, so I am attributing this condition to that.At this point, I have determined not to get the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                I developed tinnitus shortly after first vaccination.  The exact date of it starting is approximate as I didn&#39;t connect the problem initially with the vaccination - but it was definitely before my second vaccination.  My guess is that it&#39;s in both ears as one&#39;s not more apparent that another.  It&#39;s pretty constant, though some days are worse than others.

                                                At ~ 5:30 pm, while driving my vision suddenly went, for lack of a better term, haywire.  Perhaps ?Vertigo?.  Vision was such that I had to pull over so as not to cause an accident.  It was as if each eye was looking at the same view differently and all jumbles.  Perhaps like looking through a prism and seeing multiple views of the same image ,  Able to stabilize it by covering one eye and viewing with the other, and vice versa.  Was able to drive again approximately 2-3 minutes away by keeping left eye closed; and able to see ok with one eve.  When stopped and opened other eye the incident stabilized and went away.  Was able to get out of vehicle and walk ok. The following day, experienced feverish symptoms throughout the day and had 101 degree fever by 9:30 pm.  Temperature settled down to 99 by 11 pm after resting.  That is the extent of the symptoms other that a slightly sore arm at the injection site which was fine by the next day.

I will not follow guidelines that are against my best judgment for right or wrong.   I knew better then to get the second vaccine so quickly.  There was no research that indicated this was the optimum time frame.   The only justification was what was done during the trials, which was to rush it to market and garner the highest efficacy numbers.   As seen here, the outcome was anything but mild side effects and they continue.

These symptoms began to subside the next day lasting four and a half days except shortness of breath that lingered for two weeks and still is not fully restored. As you can see  by the dates these reactions happened at two different dates.

I CONTINUE TO HAVE A MUFFLED HEARING IN BOTH EARS BUT THE RIGHT EAR IS MUCH WORSE THAN THE LEFT.

                                                Took 600mg of Ibuprofen (200mg x3) orally at 7:45AM, 30 minutes later while viewing a medical webinar at my desk at home, I suddenly noticed significant itching of my entire hands which quickly became reddened and progressively swollen as the itching sensation become more generalized within 10-15 minutes. I got up from my chair to go tell my wife but as I walked a few paces, I became extremely weak with visual &#39;closing in&#39; as I barely prevented myself from collapsing to the floor / losing consciousness. At the same time my tongue was now thickened and malfunctioning making my spoken words to my wife almost unintelligible - all consistent with a CLASSIC ANAPHYLAXIS REACTION.  My wife helped me to the couch to recline where I carefully swallowed CHLORPHENIRAMINE 8MG, FAMOTIDINE 20MG; and 15 minutes later DIPHENHYDRAMINE 50MG (I did not have any Epinephrine available from prior &#39;bee sting kits&#39;). At no time was my breathing impaired nor was there any audible wheezing or dyspnea. After ~45 minutes I was improving noticeably, and after ~2-3 hours I had made a 100% recovery with no sequelae thereafter. Although I had taken my routine morning medications several HOURS PRIOR, nevertheless, (after purchasing several vials of Epinephrine 1mg/1mL for protection in case of another reaction), after this event and over the succeeding days I re-added each of those medications separately / one-at-a-time to ensure that NONE of those was the offending agent - NO problems ensued. For obvious reasons, I have 100% AVOIDED ingesting Ibuprofen or other typical NSAIDs since this episode (although my routine single daily aspirin tablet has presented no problems). BOTTOM LINE: DESPITE HAVING USED IBUPROFEN 400MG OR 600MG PERHAPS 1-2 TIMES WEEKLY AS NEEDED FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT OVER MANY YEARS, NEVER UNTIL THIS ANAPHYLACTIC EPISODE 11 DAYS AFTER MY SECOND DOSE OF MODERNA&#39;S COVID-19 VACCINE HAD THERE EVER BEEN ANY TYPE OF ADVERSE REACTION TO IBUPROFEN WHATSOEVER.

                                                Question:   I received the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine first shot on February 26, 2021, then I got the second shot on March 28.  Then on May 5 I developed shingles on the left side of my fact from my left teeth gums, left jaw, with shooting pain up to my left ear.  I never had chicken pox.    I went to a Doctor on May 8.  He gave me an Rx for the shingles pills and an anti-biotic pill.  I must take them 3 times per day.  I also received the Shingrix first shot  and will get the second shot in July.  I still have pain in my lower left jaw, left face up to ear and my left ear feels as if it is full of water like after swimming my ears fill with water and then shaking my head it drains out.  But not there is no water in the ear and no drainage.  I want to know if you have medical evidence that the MODERNA vaccine can cause my Shingles?  Is this one of the side effects?  Will I get more shingles in the future and will Shingrix vaccine prevent getting the shingles?  Did MODERNA cause the Shingles as a side effect?  Please answer these questions and email me any medical journals or articles or studies which show that the Covid-19 pandemic can Shingles or did the Moderna vaccine cause the Shingles.  Thank you for your consideration and diligent work on the research for the vaccines to stop the Covid-19 pandemic.

                                                Late afternoon on February 18 I developed a rash on my upper arms.  The rash is worse on the upper right arm.  Over the course of the evening and night the rash spread over most of my body including wrists, upper and lower legs, ankles and butt.  In addition, my lips are swollen and the taste on my lips is salty. This morning I applied topical Benadryl to the affected areas and took two Benadryl (Allergy) tablets (25 mg).  This seems to relieve the itching which is not severe and my swollen lips may be receding.   I plan to continue with this treatment and hopefully the rash and swollen lips will subside in a day or two.

Dateline and symptoms:  03/01 Received first Moderna Covid Vaccination at 3:45 p.m... 03/02 No symptoms until 6 p.m. When blood pressure started to go up from my normal level of 116/68 to 179/82 by 10 p.m..  During this time I had what felt like mild electric currents from the left side of my chest down my left arm and into my hand.  These systems subsided around 11 p.m. and by midnight my blood pressure was almost back to normal. 03/03 Felt sluggish all day but no blood pressure problems. 03/04 Felt great all day then around 6 p.m. my blood pressure started to rise, by 9:30 p.m. it was 190/90.  At this time I started to feel like my body was shutting down, my face felt flush, and experiencing long distant vision problems, so I had my wife take me to the emergency room. At 10:00 p.m. I went to the emergency room  EKG  showed no heart problems, the blood test showed no heart problems, and after 11:30 p.m. my blood pressure started going down and I was released at 1:30 a.m..  Blood test did show high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen 26.0, Bun/Creatinine Ratio 33.0, Aspartate Amino Tranf (AST/SGOT) 43, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) 59 and Alkaline Phosphatase 189, all of which are higher than my last blood test on 10/22/20. 03/05  As of 10:30 a.m. my blood pressure is 126/62.  I feel fine except I&#39;m very tired from not much sleep last night.  1p.m. Starting to feel some more chest and arm symptoms as described before, blood pressure now 146/66.

                                                On 3/24 by 9:25 PM I had mild shakes. At about 10:00 PM my lips stared to tingle and become numb. Subsequently I began to have difficulty swallowing as well as experiencing some sub sternal pain. Went to get my Epipen and put it beside me in bed. Difficulty swallowing got a bit worse but as I was not experiencing shortness of breath I held off the Epinephrine injection. (What on earth was I thinking?!)The &#34;semi anaphylaxis&#34; was self limiting and by 11:00 PM symptoms had subsided completely. But by approximately 11:30 MP I had severe rigors lasting about 3 - 5 minutes. On 3/25 I developed a severe headache and a low grade T (T-max 99.9). Took Tylenol 825mg with good effect. The following night I had severe night sweats, drenching 3 sets of pajamas. Today, on 3/26 I have been experiencing several cold sweats and I am altogether feeling &#34;strange&#34; (can&#39;t put my finger on it - maybe dehydration?). Have vegan to aggressively hydrate. Notified my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office. Agreed to &#34;ride it out&#34; for now. Shall see my PPP on

                                                I got my 2nd Covid shot Friday.  Attached is the copy of the white card. This second shot was a real hum dinger.  Started feeling headachey Friday evening, then fever of 101, chills and sick feeling through the night and most of Saturday.  Back to normal on Sunday morning.  I guess this is pretty typical of reactions to Moderna #2.  It calmed down yesterday and I was back to normal.  Still had a little fever, but nothing I could feel.   We did our standard 4 mile hike yesterday.  If wind would calm down we would go snorkeling.A couple of lesser known side effects I noted:  1. Both (name) and I got sensitive gums..discomfort with cold water, etc.  lasted one day.   2.  Peeing was strained for me for about 30 hours, then back to normal.

I never had hives before.  On Thursday morning I went to an urgent care clinic.  Doctor prescribed prednisone and a anti-histamines.  I am taking the prednisone and Benadryl. It seems like the Benadryl really helps after it kicks in.

All these symptoms continued for up to 2-3 days as heavy as, then gradually moved to my &#34;normal health&#34; after almost 7-days. During this period I took only Cetamol tablets based on the advice of my primary care physician on phone mesaging. Nowadays, I witness symptoms of tinnitus which appeared directly after the 2nd vaccine. The tinnitus was a wavy (up-down) case but it now a serious and continuous issue. This is something I did not witness or suffer from in the past. The tinnitus is impacting me a lot, and sometimes I can&#39;t sleep well.

                                                cranial nerve deficit  4, 6,9, 10, 11, 12; tongue deviation to right; double vision; tongue biting; difficulty swallowing; This spontaneous case was reported by a physician (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES MULTIPLE (cranial nerve deficit  4, 6,9, 10, 11, 12) and TONGUE PARALYSIS (tongue deviation to right) in a 70-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 025L20A and 021L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history was not provided.  Concomitant products included ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM (LIPITOR), LISINOPRIL, ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE GEL, DRIED, MAGNESIUM CARBONATE (PEPCID [ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE GEL, DRIED;MAGNESIUM CARBONATE]), OMEPRAZOLE, NEBIVOLOL HYDROCHLORIDE (BYSTOLIC) and COENZYME Q10 [UBIDECARENONE] for an unknown indication.   On 06-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form.  On 03-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form.   On an unknown date, the patient experienced deficit in the cranial nerves 4, 6, 9, 10, 11,12 after been vaccinated with 1st dose of Moderna Vaccine and difficulty with mouth which resulted in him biting his tongue. The patient&#39;s tongue deviates to the right, double vision, difficulty swallowing (swallow test was negative). Physical Exam, CTA to rule dissection (result was negative), Stroke tests were negative. MRI with/without contrast of the brain &amp; upper spinal cord which was conducted twice and the results were normal. the patient is undergoing a neurophysiology count (result is pending)  The patient experienced CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES MULTIPLE (cranial nerve deficit  4, 6,9, 10, 11, 12) (seriousness criterion medically significant), TONGUE PARALYSIS (tongue deviation to right) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIPLOPIA (double vision), TONGUE BITING (tongue biting) and DYSPHAGIA (difficulty swallowing). At the time of the report, CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES MULTIPLE (cranial nerve deficit  4, 6,9, 10, 11, 12), TONGUE PARALYSIS (tongue deviation to right), DIPLOPIA (double vision), TONGUE BITING (tongue biting) and DYSPHAGIA (difficulty swallowing) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Computerised tomogram: negative (Negative) Negative. On an unknown date, Magnetic resonance imaging brain: normal (normal) Normal. On an unknown date, Magnetic resonance imaging spinal: normal (normal) Normal. On an unknown date, Physical examination: negative (Negative) Negative.    For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient had difficulty swallowing (swallow test was negative), stroke tests were negative. His Neuro-physiologist is doing a neurophysiology count (result is pending).  No treatment information was provided.   Reporter did not allow further contact; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a causal association between the reported event and cranial nerves deficit is assessed as unlikely based on diagnostic test.  However, based on temporality, causality with the other reported events of dysphagia, tongue biting and deviation and double vision cannot be excluded.

There is little or no discomfort, but speaking is difficult and my voice is severely restricted in volume, tone and clarity. I have had no  throat ailments for the past  several years. I have not experienced symptoms like this ever before, other than an occasional sore throat associated with colds or flu.

After my second Moderna shot on 03/25/2021 against Lot # 040A21A I started experiencing double vision ( 4th Cranial Nerve Palsy) on 03/27/2021. Dr is treating me for the double vision and installed a prism film in the left eye of my glasses. I had a #10 prism installed on 04/08/2021 and it was reduced to a #6 prism on 05/21/2021. It is improving.I have another appointment with Dr.  on 07/23/2021.

Evaluated by myself 5/21/21.  Pt reported to me that although he was able to see in February he noted increased foggy vision that gradually progressed over several weeks until it stabilized.  Sx may have started in March.  Patient did not correlate to either vaccination.  He had an asymptomatic COVID&#43; test 8/26/20.   He was diagnosed with bilateral optic neuropathy on 3/26/21 and had nerve pallor.  Lab/imaging noncontributory.  Patient sought evaluation with me for add&#39;l work up recs.  He reported to me 30# weight loss but reported to Dr 100# weight loss.  No work up for weight loss or anemia as of yet.  Referred back to Primary for this.  Had previously declined colonoscpy.  Anemia felt to be 2nd to COPD.  Also tobacco use report was variable.  Rare to me.  Etiologies include post vaccination/ post covid/nutritional/anemia/idiopathic

The patient&#39;s medical history included a kidney transplant. Concomitant product use was not provided.   On 19 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 029L20A) in the left arm for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.   The patient had some mild soreness at the site of the injection which lasted one to two days. On 21 Jan 2021, he experienced some ear ringing in his right ear which was followed by hearing loss that lasted six hours. Both the ear ringing and hearing loss resolved by the next morning.   On 24 Jan 2021, the patient had ringing in his left ear, but it was not associated with hearing loss. The patient stated he thinks the tromethamine hydrochloride in the vaccine may have induced his hearing loss. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, hearing loss in right ear and ear ringing in right ear, were considered resolved on 22 Jan 2021. The event, mild soreness at the site of injection, was considered resolved on an unknown date Jan 2021. The outcome for the event, ringing in left ear, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71- year old male patient who experienced hearing loss in right ear/deafness unilateral, ear ringing in right ear/tinnitus, ringing in left ear/tinnitus, and mild soreness at the site of injection/injection site pain, all within 4 days after administration of Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273). Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Slept extra overnight and felt pretty normal the next morning. Was okay yesterday although maybe was a little weaker than normal. Feel fine today.

It improved over next week only to reappear after second vaccine and in this case took 6 weeks to disappear. It was painful and verified by two dentists who saw lesion.  I also develop three days after second vaccine, pain in right calf region and numbness in my right foot involving lateral toes and heel region. the pain disappeared within hours but the numbness has remained, now 6 weeks ater though is less than initially,   After both the first and second vaccinations, I had hemorrhagic sinusitis that lasted at least two weeks with significant drainage resulting in cough.   I had two negative Covid tests after first vaccine to confirm this was vaccine related and I had not contracted Covid.

It has been about three weeks since the shot, and it hasn?t gotten any better. Every night it?s the same thing. I am only able to sleep about three hours before it wakes me up.  The tinnitus screams at me 24 hours a day. During the day there  are other noises,  so I can function. During the night it drives me crazy.

                                                I developed facial stroke like symptoms starting on 4/16/2021 with a metallic taste in my mouth.  On 4/18/2021 I noticed some difficulty eating experiencing some mouth numbness.  The right side of my face was drooping and right eye would not close completely.  I went to the  Hospital Emergency Room mid day on the 18th.  I was examined and after some tests it was determined that I was not experiencing a stroke, but Bell&#39;s Palsy.  This was determined by the tests outlined below.  I was admitted overnight for observation and discharged the next day. I have no idea if this is related to my Covid vaccination but report this only out of an abundance of caution.

                                                Five days after receiving the vaccine I developed a ringing in the ears.  The ringing has been getting  worse each day that passes.  I have seen by GP and he is referring me to a specialist.  In the past, when I have had the flue, I have experienced such ringing in the ears.  After recovering  from such an infection, the  ringing has stopped.  This episode is more severe with additional  pressure pain that is a new symptom.  I am extremely hesitant to take the second shot of the Moderna vaccine.  If your have a recommendation , such as taking a different vaccine at a later date, please let me know.

                                                HPI: Patient is a 71 y.o male with a history of postviral herpesvirus reactivation, B12 deficiency, and recent COVID vaccination who presents with tingling sensations bilaterally in the thigh of 2.5 weeks duration. Patient received 2nd dose of COVID (Moderna) vaccine on 3/20, and afterwards reported feeling lower back pain, tingling sensations mostly in the lateral thigh down through the lower leg and dorsum of feet. As of one week ago, these symptoms have receded somewhat, and the patient now reports tingling localized to the thigh only, bilaterally, circumferentially. He describes the tingling/numbness as similar to a sunburn, and that it bothers him when walking due to friction between his skin and pant legs. Of note, the patient denies any diplopia, and notes only very minor numbness in the jaw, both of which he has experienced during episodes of his postviral reaction. Furthermore, patient did report a worsening of his tinnitus, but states that it has improved in the past 3-4 days, almost back to baseline. Patient was taking 3x 200 mg ibuprofen to little effect, and reported similar lack of relief with naproxen. Patient notes inconsistent use of B12 supplements.  Diagnosis: Immune/inflammatory response to COVID vaccine. This is the most likely etiology of the patient&#39;s symptoms given the timing of events and his history of postviral herpetic reactions. His symptoms of tingling/numbness began soon after his 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine, and due to this rapid onset and temporal association, it appears likely that his current symptoms may be related. While the symptoms described by the patient and their duration are not typical of COVID vaccine side effects, these neurological symptoms are similar to previous episodes (albeit in a different location) experienced by the patient, which responded to antivirals. As the COVID vaccine is immunogenic, and given these prior episodes of similar symptoms, the patient&#39;s current presentation is likely a reaction to the vaccine.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

(I tested positive on 12/22/20 with symptoms  starting 12/19/2020 and quarantined with a back-to-work date of 12/29/20.  The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

                                                Patient went to bed totally fine and woke up saying he could not see in one eye. I rushed him to the emergency hospital they ran cat scans, MRI, heart tests etc. He stayed overnight while they checked. The next day we went to eye doctor who told him he had a eye stroke. He would regain some of his site not all of it. Something to do with blood clot or loss of blood to the eye. I was not satisfied with that so made another drs appointment for the next day with a different eye doctor. The first eye doctor gave us some blood test to do so we did it then. Later that evening we got an emergency call form the first eye doctor to get back to the hospital right away he could lose sight in the other eye.. They found some high c-reactive protein. Normal is 8 his was over 40. They put him on heavy steroids and did biopsy on both temples of his eyes. This started last Wednesday morning. He was released from the hospital Monday Morning to see his regular doctor that afternoon. Test results for the eye would be Tuesday and all other vital tests came back fine thank goodness. On Tuesday the biopsy tests also came back negative so they are stopping steroids. I think they were looking for auto immune issues. Today we are going to Rheumatologist

                                                Almost exactly 48 hours after the injection, I felt pain behind my left ear, extending down my neck to my jaw and up to the side and back of my head.   The pain was so severe (maybe 3 or 4 on a 10 scale) that I was unable to sleep much for two nights.   It has now been 4 days since the injection, and my jaw area aches.  The paid behind my ear has subsided somewhat and I was able to sleep some during the day today.   My wife received her second injection at the same time as mine.  She experienced pain behind both her ears on the second day but it went away after 24 hours and she now has no symptoms. If this discomfort continues for another day or two, I wonder if I should go to a medical clinic or emergency room.

After a couple of days my mouth improved. My mouth was almost well by Feb16. On Feb 10 I received the Moderna covid boster vaccine.  On Feb 17 my mouth again became numb and swollen. As of this date 2/22/2021 my mouth is again improving and is nearly well. I visited my Primary Care Doctor on Feb 19, 2021. We decided to wait and see if this gets better on its own. If not I will see an Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist.

                                                2/26/2021 woke up with swelling of left eye after shot. Contacted cancer center to report this. Used cold compress,  2 Benadryl followed 45 minutes later with one decadron. Swelling went down and contacted cancer center to let them know. I have had a few reactions when I was getting  chemo ,vidaza, and after getting platelets. The have used the same treatment I did today.

                                                Got the vaccine and had soreness in the arm and felt great, and on Saturday 3/6/21 late afternoon his head hurt to touch his hair.  He knew what it was from previous experience.  Was on the top of his head to the right rear predominantly, probably 4&#34; or so.  It was painful and tied into his right eye as he was photophobic with this as well and sunlight would affect that and would get a spasm of pain/2 second or so in the top of his head.  These events continued intermittently until Tuesday 3/9/21 when it was gone, but on his right tricep has a scraping sore feeling on it, which still continues as of today 3/16/21, but only faintly.

On 16th March at 7:30 am I started to feel dizzy and out of balance and then suddenly my hearing in my right ear went and I had a sort of wind noise in my ear but no hearing. At approximately 1:00pmmy wife called our Doctor and he said that this could be a rare side effect of the Covid Vaccine and to allow up to 24 hours for the effect to resolve itself. By 4:00pm.the effect did resolve itself but returned at 10:00amon 18th March and lasted for 4 hours. Since then I have been OK with no further effects.

                                                Numbness in lower lip and numbness and slight trembling in right side of face (similar to Bells Palsy?) after four days of being administered the first shot in the right arm. After a video consult with my PCP it was recommended that I go to the hospital and get a CT scan to rule out a possible minor stroke. The CT scan was negative. The numbness became better after two weeks but has not subsided.  After consultation with the doctor in charge of the vaccine operation for the site it was decided that I go ahead and take the second shot but instead of the right arm I should take it in either the left arm or the left thigh. The second shot was administered in the left thigh. I experienced the typical symptoms on the second day - fever, chills and aches and pain but they went away towards the end of the second day. However, exactly on the fourth day I experienced increased numbness in my lower lip and on the right side of my face. Today is the fifth day and it is still there. I expect that this numbness will continue for several weeks as it did with the first shot and so far it has not subsided after the first shot and has now increased after the second shot. I am totally convinced that this is a direct result of the vaccine.

After 1st dose I had slight headaches; after 2nd dose I have significant hearing loss, like someone put sound attenuating ear muffs over my ears, this occured about 4 hours after the 2nd dose (March 29). This feeling went away but now I have constant buzzing in both ears, constantly.  Did not have these problems before the vaccine.

                                                Loss of hearing in his right ear; A spontaneous report was received from a 73-year-old, male, patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced hearing loss in right ear.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt in his head. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 12 Jan 2021, approximately two days prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, the patient had dental work done where four crowns were prepped and temporaries were put in, he then lost hearing in his right ear. Treatment information was not provided. He thinks that the loss of hearing might be due to this dental procedure as they were drilling for hours. He states that he has a VP shunt in this head which needs readjustments occasionally. He is seeing his neurosurgeon for the readjustment.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event, hearing loss in right ear, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73 year-old, male patient with history of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt in his head, who experienced event of hearing loss in right ear. The event occurred 2 days after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event is assessed as possibly related.  However, on the same day and prior to the onset of the event, the patient had extensive dental procedures done which may provide an alternative explanation for the event.

I was tired the rest of the day from the fever but otherwise OK.  No further problems until today (Monday, Feb. 15). I have a ringing in my left ear but I have no reason to believe that is related to the vaccine. You might but I don&#39;t.

I&#39;ve had tinnitus before this for a couple years, but it was at a minimum very tolerable level until the covid shot.  It&#39;s been 2 weeks and it&#39;s very difficult to sleep because of the unbearable increase in loudness in my tinnitus since the 2nd day of my shot.  I got a hearing test this week (Friday Feb 19th) and my audiologist said I had NO loss of hearing from the shot.

                                                I first noticed a buzzing in my ears on February 28th driving home from out of town.  My wife said she had static-like noises and asked me if I heard it too.  She thought there might be something wrong with our car radio.  I said I did, so she turned off the radio to see if it would go away, but we both still heard it.  We have both had this symptom several times since then, often at the same time but not always.

                                                Received the vaccine on Thursday 3/11 3:15PM.  Around 2PM on Friday 3/12, noticed that my right jaw was feeling sore when I chewed on things.  Didn&#39;t think much of it until dinner time when my jaw hurt everytime I took a bite of food.  Couldn&#39;t think of anything I did to cause it, and assumed it would get better soon. On Saturday, my jaw was still sore when I had lunch, but maybe a little better.  But then at dinner time it was back to hurting again.  Sunday it was still sore when  I had lunch.  By then I was starting to attribute it to possibly being the vaccine I received on 3/11, even though there was no mention of this as a side effect on any of the sheets I received when I got my vaccine.  I then signed-up to v-safe to see what they might offer. Then I called the on-call nurseline (where I got the shot).  An RN called back and we went over everything, and at the end she recommended I go into an Emergency room to get checked out because jaw paint can possibly mean heart issues or other things to be concerned about.  I was very surprised about her recommendation, but decided to take her advice.  Went to an emergency clinic.   While I was in the waiting room, a woman who was also waiting said she heard me talking about the reason I was in and said her husband had experienced the same symptoms after his Covid vaccine that I did!  He had a Moderna shot on 2/27 and then several days later his right jaw got sore.  He went to the doctor on 3/8 and they said he had TMJ, but the next day his pain went away and he has been ok since.  They examined me, took blood for Troponin, did an EKG.  All looked OK.  I told them about the person in the waiting room and her husband and they said they weren&#39;t aware that this was an issue with this vaccine.  They sent me home and said to monitor and follow-up with my family doctor if it persists.  As of today,  I am still having the pain in my right jaw.  It has stayed the same since it started - no better/no worse.  I suspect of there are 2 of us with this symptom, there are probably many others.

                                                I have a history of visual floaters. Eight hours after the shot, simultaneous with the initiation of soreness at the vaccination site, these increased, while they are usually minor. Also, i experienced a new phenomenon: a translucent paramecium-shaped image in both eyes: lower left of left eye and lower right of right eye. All these symptoms disappeared after 20 minutes or so and did not recur. Yesterday, I visited my optometrist, who did a dilation to check the retina and found nothing amiss. But she thought my experience should be reported.

                                                Left ear pain: started after second dose of Moderna vaccine on 3/12. Patient describes the pain as a throbbing sensation that occurs in the upper earlobe.  It interferes with his sleep. Improves with heat, aspirin/ibuprofen/Tylenol. Aggravated by swallowing.Gradually this has improved over the weekend and until today.  He has not needed any ibuprofen over the past week.  He does endorse having other side effects associated with the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, including back pain and myalgias; these completely resolved within several days. Patient denies any associated headache.  He denies any jaw claudication symptoms.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

                                                On 26 Feb R eye became clouded.  By the 28th, I had lost all sight in R eye.  Suspected I had a torn retina, as I had in L eye several years earlier, I made an appointment on the 26th to see my optometrist.  I saw him on 3 March where he diagnosed that I had a more serious problem.  At that time some of my R eye sight had returned but I could only see the top line in the chart.  He made an appointment that day for me to see an ophthalmologist.  She checked me out.  I had a severely inflamed optic nerve in the R eye and my L eye optic nerve was inflamed but not to the extent of the Right one.  I was sent to get an echo cardiogram and a carotid artery ultrasound.  I was referred to a neurologist ophthalmologist but couldn&#39;t get in until March 12.  On March 10th I was told to go to the ER room for a workup prior to my 12 March appointment.  I got an MRI CAT scan, lots of blood work, etc.  I&#39;m running out of time to finish this.

They thought cleaning the ears would do.  Not so.  To schedule next apt on 3/6/21 was harder to get apt.  Iwas put on 50mg of Prednisone daily for 10 days.  I saw the doctor again today and he gave me a second type of steroid which was thru the ear drum into the nerve. I go back on 4/27/21.  I have got back hearing in the left ear but Iam only 30% in the right ear.

                                                After receiving my first Moderna Covid vaccination I started experiencing tinnitus.  I asked the nurse when receiving my second vaccination, if they&#39;d received any other complaints and was told no.  Subsequently, I have googled and discovered that, indeed, others have experienced tinnitus after their first vaccination.  The long and short is that I now have constant ringing in my head with no relief in sight.  It has been over a month since its onset.

He was airlifted to another Hospital and was there until 3-13-21 while there he received a feeding tube because he couldn&#39;t eat because he lost the ability to swallow without it going to his lungs. he was then sent to a rehab facility till 4-6-21. with a total hospitals and rehab stay of a month and 2 days. he is extremely weak on his right side unable to stand and walk on his own, he has vertigo and severe balance issues, he also still is unable to see having double vision and other issues escalating the dizziness. still on multiple medications for issues from this. he was a very strong independent hard working man, working more then half the people half his age, this has greatly effected his life and we are lucky to still have him because the stroke was bad enough that we know that they saved his life only by the quick action of the hospital

                                                After the first vaccination, I was tired for 24 hours. However, with the second vaccination, I began experiencing more serious symptoms or reactions. Serious shortness of breath, as if unable to get sufficient oxygen. Extremely tired. Headaches behind my eyes. It is normally very unusual for me to get headaches. Dizziness and loss of balance. Weak and impaired vision. Eyes very sensitive to sunlight. Changes in ability to taste foods and sometimes foods taste very different. Pain spikes - various muscle and joint pain spikes. These symptoms have lasted for the past 8 weeks. I feel like most of the symptoms are gradually subsiding, but the time period is too short to be sure (as some symptoms come and go). I am anxiously expecting them to subside in the near future. I am sending this information to you for the purposes of records and statistics. I really do not have a choice in accepting the vaccinations because I am in my 70s. My son developed cancer; so, I had to make sure I do not expose him.

                                                Serious skin rash over much of my body: face, trunk, arms, scalp, groin and neck. The most serious and troubling area is around the neck where t-shirt collar contacts the skin. Some areas don&#39;t itch, but the head and neck do. Facial areas that are normally oily are now very dry, scaling and itching. Pre-existing skin problems are now heavily exaggerated. Dry areas on the fingers are worse. Dandruff is much worse. First noticed as an irritation around the eyes. Tears were burning my face, as if acidified. Then I noticed the rash on my arms. Further inspection revealed it on my face, neck, trunk and groin area. There is dryness, scaling and flaking around the eyes, nose, mouth and ears. The neck is most troubling with heat, itching and burning causing lack of sleep. It is not abating and appears to be getting worse. I will be seeking medical attention for the first time this week. If this is related to the vaccine, I want to make that known. I had the second of two shots on the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (lot #047B21A), on May 07 at noon, meaning I was fully antibody protected on 05-21, immediately before the rash was noticed. A bad body rash is associated with this vaccine, but I find no documentation that it has been observed this long after vaccination. Just the same, I am reporting this today in part because I want this to be documented as a possible reaction to the vaccine. Other possible causes have been ruled out. Currently taking Benadryl, NSAIDS, moisturizing cream, and hydrocortisone cream.

Wednesday 1/6/21 swelling had spread significantly to inside the right side of mouth and tongue also affecting right jaw. By 3 Pm that day my tongue was numb and swollen on the right side as well as the right side of my mouth and jaw. I could only chew, eat, and swallow effectively on the left side of my mouth using the left side of my tongue to negotiate eating.  I could only this with small amounts of food. By that evening about 4 hours later I could eat , chew etc. pretty good but the swelling &amp; discomfort remained but reduced to a functional level.  Today, Thursday 1/7/21, the soreness and discomfort remains inside throat, mouth, tongue and jaw all on the right side.

I am a board crtified family physician. Beginning about 12 hours after the Moderna vaccine, I became fatigued, feverish (99.1) , ached in the thighs and calves, and had a 2-3 hour salty taste triggering thirst. The injection site became very tender but there was no inflammation nor rash.   All symptoms resolved on awakening 9:00 am 1/8/21.

Patient called on 2/5/2021 stating he had some tongue numbness and eye swelling about 30 minutes after the injection.  He did not seek emergency care, did not take any OTC medications. Phone call to patient 2/8/2021 he states on his ride home after the first injection he noticed that the top of his tongue became numb and he developed some swelling around the edge of my eyes and the back of my tongue felt thick.  He went home and took a nap. When he woke up, he felt great.  No swelling around eyes, tongue was not numb nor did it feel thick any longer.  Patient tells me he has had a reaction like this before to a chemo enhancing medication, he does not remember the name. Patient states he still wants to receive the second dose.

                                                Began developing a fuzzy eye sight in right eye; progressively worse, unable to focus. On Wednesday 2/3/2021 I noticed a large amount of long and moving floaters in the ight eye, swirling, growing and then fading - like someone poured a stream of ink in water. By Friday 2/4/2021 unable to focus from right eye and went to Ophthalmologist for eye exam; He made arrangements to send me to a clinic in and I will see them on Wednesday 2/10/2021. I don&#39;t know whether or not this is related to the COVID vaccine but it is the only unusual event that has occurred in the last 45 days.

                                                Extreme sensitivity / intolerance to  loud sounds.  During the cleaning of  my house by people who have been doing it for years I found that the sounds of a vacuum cleaner working and normal conversations between the cleaners and my wife and daughter became almost intolerable.  I was unable to concentrate on work I was doing and had to go to a room where those sounds were significantly less.  I have never before experience this intolerance to customary sound levels.  The intolerance passed within about three hours of when I noticed it.

It took 2 calls to 911 before I could convince him to go the the ER. While there, he suffered 2 grand mal seizures and he was transferred to another hospital for further treatment.

                                                The day following the first dose of the vaccine I felt a slight itch at site of injection. Then on 2/22 at 3:00am I was woken up with swelling on both upper and lower lips. In the morning I observed a large red rash below the injection site, approximately 2 inches round. Later that day I observed welts or hives on both arms, my back, both upper and lower. They were very itchy.  I took 2 capsules (25mg each) of  Allergy Relief (diphenhydramine HCL) twice a day for 4 days and applied  Pain Relief Cream (4% lidocaine) to all itchy areas after showering and before retiring at night to relieve the itching.  The swelling in my lips receded and the rash on my right arm faded. I stopped taking the pills for the next 2 days, but the itch remained so I took the pills at the same dosage and applied the cream as described above for 3 more days and now all symptoms have resolved except for some mild periodic itching on my upper back.

It was 102. that evening I was dizzy and vomiting and I was shaking terribly. My temp went up as high as 103.2. It eased with 2 tylenol  I run a temperature for 3 days. I lost my sense of smell and taste. I had not been anywhere where I could have had contact with someone who had covid to my knowledge. My sense of smell has come back but my taste of food has slowly coming back. I would rather report it here then to say anything in public. My partner can tell I was bedridden for several days and still get and stay very tired.I did not go to emergency room only called them

I had a regularly scheduled eye doctor appointment the following Monday  1/25 and I waited until then to get checked out.  My eye pressure in my right eye was 18, a few ticks above what it has been running.  The eye pressure in my left eye was 45, extremely high.  My eye doctor prescribed some steroids&#39;  and other eye pressure drops and he wanted to see me the next morning.  By then I had three does of these new drops.  The next morning my right eye pressure dropped to 16 and my left eye, the problem eye dropped to 10.  We kept eye drop regiment for two weeks and set another appointment following my second vaccine shot to see if there was a reaction.  It turns out that my left eye pressure was 11.  Now we don&#39;t knw if virus vaccine was responsible or not.  However the vaccine shots were the only new events in my life, so it became highly suspicious.

                                                I vaccinated the pt who stated he only had a sore arm with the first vaccine and no other reaction and that he had never had any kind of severe reaction to drugs, vaccines, or foods.  Approximately 5-10 minutes after vaccinating Client, I was informed that his top lip was swelling as he sat in our Waiting Area.  I immediately went to check on him and observed visible swelling of the middle of his top lip.  I asked if he had noticed any other swelling, trouble swallowing, or breathing, to which he replied he did not.  I then when to check with the pharmacist running the clinic to verify the best way to proceed.  I was prepared with an Epipen a few feet away from pt to use if needed. Another pharmacist, brought over an ice pack. Pharmacist again questioned the pt who affirmed he had no other symptoms and that the swelling did not appear to be spreading.  We offered to call 911 and the pt declined, insisting that we not make a fuss.  We insisted that we wanted to make sure he did not have any trouble breathing or any other reaction and to sit for 30 minutes of observation.  Pt accepted the ice pack and reluctantly agreed to sit for &#34;a while&#34;.  I sat with the pt monitoring him closely for about 30 minutes and engaged him in conversation.  Pt had no issues breathing or speaking and repeatedly stated that it was not itchy or painful and the swelling had receded minimally after 30 minutes.  He experienced no other symptoms, but was tired and wanted to go home,  He explained that he had his colon removed this past Monday and was in some discomfort and was very tired.  The patient was eager to leave and again declined further medical treatment.  I provided the patient with generic benadryl tablets since he he did not have any at home.  I instructed him to go home, take 2 tablets with a big glass of water, and take his nap. I asked if I could call him later this afternoon to follow-up with him and he approved.  I told him that I would report the incident here.  I also told him that if his symptoms worsened and if he had any trouble breathing to call 911.  The patient then left the Waiting Area.

Unable to sleep further. at about 4:00 AM got up for bathroom break and      My eyesight was unfocused (and remained so until the afternoon)      I had trouble moving my eyes; stiff; strange      My equilibrium was very poor and unsteady. Had to touch walls, etc      I was generally very weak and had trouble walking and sitting down, and then getting up At about 7-8AM, wrote my new PCP and as I was writing, I started to get intensley hot, sweat like I had malaria (I&#39;ve never had), my heart was REALLY racing, and my skin under my t-shirt became so sensitive I felt like the t was pricking me. Very strange. Started to minimize reactions about 6-8 hours after waking up. I was unable to do my morning PT because of the weakness. I typically go to bed around 23:30, but on the 26th I went to bed at 21:00 and fell right to sleep. Next day (today) was back to 99.9999% normal. Did my morning PT (about 20 minutes plus 10 minutes on the bike). What I have is still soreness in knees. Luckily my pacemaker/defib didn&#39;t get set off by my heart incident. Feel free to call me, if you want.

                                                Patient received vaccination at clinic and was in the waiting area for the 15 minute monitoring time. About 5 minutes into the waiting time, patient said he was getting light headed. It was noticed he was taking deep, sharp breaths causing his mask to go in his mouth. We switched him to a chair with arms and asked him to remove his jacket and called 911 as a precautionary as the breathing pattern was not improving.  EMS arrived to ask the patient how he was feeling and he said he had a dry mouth and was thirsty. At this time, it was aout 15 minutes after the vaccination. Patient refused transport and asked for water. I asked EMS if that was advisable now that he declined transport and it was beyond the 15 minutes. EMS was still near the patient. Patient was provided water and was able to remove his mask to drink and was much more coherent afterwards. He stayed in the pharmacy area about 20 minutes. He was asked to have his wife drive, which he refused.

At the night progressed he had muscle weakness, lip tingling, eyelid droop, loss of bowel and bladder function, moreso bladder.  He was slow in his responses, and his wife noticed that was getting weaker and could not get up from the bathroom.  She feels it was more muscle weakness than anything.    On 1/29/21 he was bad most of the day  1/30/21 he started to come out of it little and knew what she was saying.   Now today 2/8/21 he is about 93% back to his baseline.  Nothing taken, but did speak to the doctor and he at that time told him not to take the 2nd vaccine.
