                                                I woke up at approximately 4:00 am with an extremely dry mouth. I went into the bathroom and took a drink of water. I returned to bed. I noticed that my breathing was becoming more rapid. I had trouble catching my breath. I sat up on the side of the bed. My heart was pounding and quick. My breathing was difficult. I woke up my wife. After about 5 minutes my symptoms improved. She took my pulse which was now at 62ppm.  I laid back down in a reclined position. My symptoms of difficulty breathing and elevated heart rate quickly returned. My pulse was now up to 98 ppm.  I sat up again. My symptoms gradually improved. Being unsure of what was going on my wife called 911.  The ambulance arrived in about 8 minutes.  I was about 60% better. Vitals were improving other than my blood pressure which was 180/100 Being unsure of what was happening, I was transported to Hospital.   I  had a chest x-ray, a chest CT scan with contrast to rule out a blood clot, blood work including tests to rule out MI x2. All test were negative.  By about 6:30 am I was feeling at least 80% better. My breathing I felt had returned to normal. My pulse was down into the 50&#34;s which is my normal range.

                                                About eight hours after the injection, I noticed some hearing impairment in my left ear.  Sounds are muffled, almost as if I have water trapped in the ear canal.  I noticed this right before I went to bed, and the hearing loss is still present and similar in magnitude this morning.  There is no pain, and the hearing in my right ear seems to be normal, although I can&#39;t rule out some slight loss on that side.  Aside from a slightly sore arm at the injection site, I&#39;ve had no other side effects (e.g., no fever) from the vaccination.

I did not fall. I stumbled into the bathroom, still unsteady. I urinated sitting down, still feeling unsteady, head spinning. I took my blood pressure 130/70, which is normal. Was feeling steadier. Was able to walk down stairs to ground floor of home. Still not felling normal, but steady on my feet. After eating breakfast, no additional symptoms through day. I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages over the past week. When I went to bed Sat night, lying in bed I was light headed. Sunday morning same problems. I performed some vehicle maintenance and would get down on the ground. Head would start spinning, everything would return to normal once standing. At bedtime same feelings when lying down in bed. Monday morning (today) same problems.

                                                Began feeling very weak with a constant headache that later led to blurry vision on March, 2, 2021.  On the morning of March 4, 2021,  I was still experiencing a right sided headache as well as double vision.  I was no longer able to drive at that point.  I took my blood pressure digitally at the local pharmacy twice where it was 200/104.  I went home to call my physician and also have my wife take my blood pressure manually.  My blood pressure at that time was 214/106.  I went to the hospital where they examined me and then discharged me with a General Headache without a know cause.  I contacted my PCP and he advised me to quadruple my Lisinopril until my BP came down to normal range and see him the morning.  My visit the next day showed an elevated blood pressure, double vision, and a continuing headache.  My meds were adjusted to Lisinopril 10 mg qd and an addition of Norvasc 5 mg qd.  Later that day my blood pressure was down, but still not in the normal range.   The following day, March 6, 2021, I was still having the same issues despite the changes in medication.  I took my blood pressure at 6 pm and it was 199/104.  I immediately went to another hospital where I was admitted as  a &#34;stroke alert&#34; patient in hypertensive emergency.  I am presently being followed as an inpatient in order to get these issues under control.

Have had a high pitched ringing or hissing in ears since receiving the vaccine; did not make the connection to the vaccine because tinnitus was not disclosed as a side effect, and no questions about this side effect were raised in follow up surveys. Yesterday, while reading an article about someone, committing suicide, I saw a reference to tinnitus.  Only now do I see many reports online of this side effect.

                                                Significant increase in tinnitus starting about 10 days after the injection. First observed in right ear and then in the left ear. This is a long time 20 year sufferer of tinnitus. The observation is a very significant change in the level experienced.  Concerned about having the second injection and impact it would have on quality of life if this does not subside.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there. Pt woke up this morning and went from his bed to his chair and since then pt was not able to get up from the chair.

                                                Patient received vaccination at clinic and was in the waiting area for the 15 minute monitoring time. About 5 minutes into the waiting time, patient said he was getting light headed. It was noticed he was taking deep, sharp breaths causing his mask to go in his mouth. We switched him to a chair with arms and asked him to remove his jacket and called 911 as a precautionary as the breathing pattern was not improving.  EMS arrived to ask the patient how he was feeling and he said he had a dry mouth and was thirsty. At this time, it was aout 15 minutes after the vaccination. Patient refused transport and asked for water. I asked EMS if that was advisable now that he declined transport and it was beyond the 15 minutes. EMS was still near the patient. Patient was provided water and was able to remove his mask to drink and was much more coherent afterwards. He stayed in the pharmacy area about 20 minutes. He was asked to have his wife drive, which he refused.
