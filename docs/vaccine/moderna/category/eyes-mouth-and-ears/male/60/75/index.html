                                                I woke up at approximately 4:00 am with an extremely dry mouth. I went into the bathroom and took a drink of water. I returned to bed. I noticed that my breathing was becoming more rapid. I had trouble catching my breath. I sat up on the side of the bed. My heart was pounding and quick. My breathing was difficult. I woke up my wife. After about 5 minutes my symptoms improved. She took my pulse which was now at 62ppm.  I laid back down in a reclined position. My symptoms of difficulty breathing and elevated heart rate quickly returned. My pulse was now up to 98 ppm.  I sat up again. My symptoms gradually improved. Being unsure of what was going on my wife called 911.  The ambulance arrived in about 8 minutes.  I was about 60% better. Vitals were improving other than my blood pressure which was 180/100 Being unsure of what was happening, I was transported to Hospital.   I  had a chest x-ray, a chest CT scan with contrast to rule out a blood clot, blood work including tests to rule out MI x2. All test were negative.  By about 6:30 am I was feeling at least 80% better. My breathing I felt had returned to normal. My pulse was down into the 50&#34;s which is my normal range.

At 7:06 am I noticed  left side facial swelling and slightly obstructed throat.  Swelling worsened only slightly from 7am to 9am. At 9am I took 100mg Benadryl and withing 45 minutes swelling was subsiding and breathing was normal. Arrived at ER at around 11:am. Was treated with EPINEPHrine, methylPREDNISolone and saline IV. Released after a few hours

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

                                                About 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient experienced burning and tingling on his tongue and hands. Patient took 2 Benadryl 25mg capsules and was monitored for 15 minutes. Stated he was feeling much better and it was going home. I followed up with him this evening at 8pm and he was stating he felt fine now and just drowsy from Benadryl.

                                                Patient received their vaccine and sat in a chair, within approx. two minutes the patient told another patient they felt hot, I was already walking to the patient to check on them,. The patient&#39;s eyes were glazed, Almost immediately the patients eyes rolled back in his head. I shook his arm and shouted to him , he was unresponsive with agonal breaths.. I shouted for help from the other nurses. RNs came immediately. We moved him to the floor, called for an epinephrine injection to be prepared, I began to prepare the site for epinephrine injection to his thigh, nurse checked for pulse... at this time the patient was still unresponsive with agonal breaths... no pulse was felt so compressions were commenced by RN. Nurse gave approx. 15 compressions to the patients chest ,  the patient spontaneously  began to recover. Carotid and radial pulses were felt at this time. Breathing returned to normal. While this was occurring, we called a code blue and 911 was activated. By the time 911 responded the patient was fully conscious , alert and responsive. He could tell us his name and how he felt prior to this incident. The patient was transferred via a  stretcher by EMS 911 and RN accompanied him to the ER to give a report. The timeframe for being pulseless and having agonal breaths lasted no more than 30-40 seconds. Patient denied any history of a seizure disorder. No  epinephrine or IM Benadryl were administered at the incident site by the responding staff due to the spontaneous recovery.

                                                Received the first COVID vaccine on March 18 and two days later I suddenly lost hearing in my left ear. This was near total hearing loss. I could only hear a slight buzz when putting a phone to my ear and listening for the dial tone. Went to my health care provider a couple of days later. They cleaned both ears and examined for any obvious problems. This seemed to improve the hearing in the ear slightly. Physician&#39;s Assistant said the hearing loss was most likely a reaction to the vaccine and advised giving it two weeks to see if it improves. Hearing didn&#39;t improve much (if at all) throughout the remainder of the week. Over the weekend of March 27-28 hearing seemed to be improving. This morning, March 29, hearing has noticeably improved and I can carry on a phone conversation using my left ear. Hearing is not back to normal yet but it is much better than a few days ago.

Still experiencing a lot of anxiety at night. Admits to heart palpitations and hard time breathing. Can&#39;t sit still. Reports manic episodes and cycles of depression over the course of hours. Patient states it has gotten a tiny bit better. Tried trazodone which helps temporarily. Denies chest pain. Patient states he has no appetite. Palpitations resolved pretty quickly. Shortness of breath is described as tightness that comes with anxiety feeling. Resolves with shoulder massage. Occurring three times per day. Also admits to dry mouth. Patient admits to needing to sleep with multiple pillows or feeling like he had to sit up and couldn&#39;t lay down as shortness of breath would get worse.  EKG in office on 2/24/21 showed ST-T changes and given symptoms patient was transferred to emergency room via ambulance.  Work up in hospital was unremarkable and patient was diagnosed with pericarditis (unknown etiology) and prescribed NSAIDS from ER and discharged.  Admission not required.   Patient followed up to us as outpatient on 03.02.21.  Patient felt much better and had not take motrin for 1 day.  COVID testing obtained at this point (unclear why ER did not send it).  Patient referred to outpatient cardiology given risk of cardiovascular disease, stress echo, and event monitor.

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

                                                About eight hours after the injection, I noticed some hearing impairment in my left ear.  Sounds are muffled, almost as if I have water trapped in the ear canal.  I noticed this right before I went to bed, and the hearing loss is still present and similar in magnitude this morning.  There is no pain, and the hearing in my right ear seems to be normal, although I can&#39;t rule out some slight loss on that side.  Aside from a slightly sore arm at the injection site, I&#39;ve had no other side effects (e.g., no fever) from the vaccination.

He went to sleep and thought it would be better.  On Sunday morning he could not stand the sunlight at all, and pain on top of the eye.  He went to the ER and they called the eye doctor in.  He didn&#39;t know what was going on, had blood work done.  He told him to FU with his doctor.  Gave him eye drops, Ibuprofen and eye cream to go into the eye.  He is feeling better today, but when the light hits it a certain way the pain is bad, but it clears.  In the morning he has to get used to the sunlight.  His eye is red.  He is to FU with his PCP.

                                                My oxygen levels dropped below what they had been previously as I am recovering from Covid infection  tested positive 20 October 2020.  If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

First time was full face swelling about 51 hours after vaccine and and 20 hours after eating lobster and other shellfish pasts dinner. (63 and never been allergic to shellfish before) on Saturday. First swelling went down slowly and gone within 24 hours. Following Tuesday, woke to swelling/numbness of lower right mouth &amp; lip. Lessened throughout day. Thursday, woke to upper left and upper right lips numb and swollen. Lessened throughout day. Today, woke to lower left lip numb and swollen like I?d been punched in mouth. Wife insisted I go see doctor immediately.

                                                Approximately three days of my first Moderna dose, I began to have difficulty rinsing and spitting from my mouth after brushing my teeth.  There is a some what dull pain above the left side of my top lip.  I do not get full pressure when spitting and the left side of my mouth does not seem to move when I spit.  It almost feels like it was shot up with Novacaine. I went swimming on March 14 and when I blew air out of my mouth  none came out of the left side.

The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks.

Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

                                                Before the COVID vaccine, I had a very mild case of tinnitus in the left ear. There was no discernible ringing, except occasionally at night in bed when it was quiet. One hour after the 1st COVID vaccine shot on March 2nd, there was extremely loud ringing in the left ear, which scared me terribly. It lasted about a minute. Whille the ringing is not as loud, there is constant ringing which overcomes everyday sound. For instance, when talking to people or watching television, the ringing is still heard. In addition, the ringing is often pulsating, which is a new experience for me.   Clearly, my tinnitus has gotten much worse as a result of the event.   I AM CONCERNED THE 2ND DOSE WILL MAKE THE RINGING WORSE.

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

Then proceeded to get a slight noticeable increase in heart rate.   After setting for approximately 15 minutes I was released to leave. I mentioned to them that I just lived down the street and told them if I had any further issues or symptoms I would call them.  Approximately 30 minutes later I was having a slight lightning of the throat or airway and some slight tightness in breathing.  This tightness continued for approximately 2 hrs. I called the clinic and was attempting to get there recommendations but the nurse had left. I was told to get the ambulance personnel. As a prior EMT I felt that an ambulance was not needed at this time. I took 2 ea   Benadryl tablets and those symptoms lessened. Some numbness in lips and face, and felt heart beating in lips. That all subsided as well after taking Benadryl.  Still trying to get with a provider that could give me advise moving forward. The doctor was busy with an Emergency.

                                                History      Chief Complaint Patient presents with ? Elevated Blood Pressure ? Dizziness     multiple times a day   Patient who presents to the emergency department today for evaluation of hypertension, head pain, blurry vision, and neck pain. He states about 6 months ago he had open heart surgery. Since that time he states that he has been having intermittent episodes of blurry vision usually lasts a few minutes and resolve on their own. Today however, he notes that the blurry vision lasted for greater than 5 minutes and he started to become concerned. During that time he also began to experience some pain in his neck and a headache in the back of his head. He took his blood pressure at that time and noted that his systolic blood pressure was in the 190s. This alarmed him and so they called EMS. When EMS arrived they rechecked his blood pressure again and his systolic blood pressure was over 200. Upon arrival here to the ER he states that he is feeling much better and his blood pressure appears to be better as well. At this time he states he still having some right shoulder pain and a little bit of right-sided neck pain but he does state that he had his Covid vaccine yesterday in his right arm. Currently patient states he still has a little bit of a posterior headache but it is much improved. He denies any fevers, body aches, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or swelling of the lower extremities. He has no known drug allergies.       ? ED Course: I discussed physical exam finding with patient. Apparently most of his symptoms have already resolved at this time. His blood pressure is back down to 142/98. I still advise since he was having some weird blurry vision I would like to get a CBC, CMP, troponin, EKG, and a chest x-ray. Patient agreeable to this plan of care. We will also continue to monitor his blood pressure to ensure that it does not spike back up.     Patient&#39;s work-up was unremarkable. His blood pressures down to 123/60 and states he is feeling much better. This point time it sounds like what happened was a hypertensive urgency. I advised him he needs to contact his PCP and schedule close follow-up discuss if anything further needs to be done. At this time though he is safe to be discharged home with strict return precautions.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

                                                I developed a swollen lymph node in my right side neck just under lower jaw at rear. This presented itself as strong jaw pain like a bad cavity and soreness at the lymph node. I have a sore throat and have not been able to hardly chew or swallow without pain. This is still going on as of 3/3/21 but seems to be easing up a bit. I have a Dr. appointment on 2/9/21 to check it out.

                                                Began feeling very weak with a constant headache that later led to blurry vision on March, 2, 2021.  On the morning of March 4, 2021,  I was still experiencing a right sided headache as well as double vision.  I was no longer able to drive at that point.  I took my blood pressure digitally at the local pharmacy twice where it was 200/104.  I went home to call my physician and also have my wife take my blood pressure manually.  My blood pressure at that time was 214/106.  I went to the hospital where they examined me and then discharged me with a General Headache without a know cause.  I contacted my PCP and he advised me to quadruple my Lisinopril until my BP came down to normal range and see him the morning.  My visit the next day showed an elevated blood pressure, double vision, and a continuing headache.  My meds were adjusted to Lisinopril 10 mg qd and an addition of Norvasc 5 mg qd.  Later that day my blood pressure was down, but still not in the normal range.   The following day, March 6, 2021, I was still having the same issues despite the changes in medication.  I took my blood pressure at 6 pm and it was 199/104.  I immediately went to another hospital where I was admitted as  a &#34;stroke alert&#34; patient in hypertensive emergency.  I am presently being followed as an inpatient in order to get these issues under control.

                                                3 days after second injection of Moderna COVID vaccine my tinnitus increased in volume to a level I could barely hear and never experienced before.  It was difficult to sleep.   By morning the ringing had decreased in volume, more like I normally have.  I thought it might have been a coincidence, however my wife has now had a similar reaction to J&amp;J vaccine and I have seen others reporting the same issue. My prior reaction to the first and second shots were soreness at the injection site which resolved after 4-5 days.

                                                Patient waited at the pharmacy for 15 minutes with no problems at all.  Patient&#39;s wife called back 2 hours later around 12:43pm  and said the patient noticed a metallic taste in his mouth about 15 minutes after his vaccination.  No other adverse issues.  I called patient back around 2:15pm and he was resting with no other issues per consult with wife.    Advised patient&#39;s wife to seek immediate medical attention if any other adverse events developed (rash, swelling, itching, tickle in throat any difficulty breathing,  facial drooping or anything out of the ordinary).    Also advised patients wife to contact us if there were any changes or if the patient had to seek medical treatment.

Have had a high pitched ringing or hissing in ears since receiving the vaccine; did not make the connection to the vaccine because tinnitus was not disclosed as a side effect, and no questions about this side effect were raised in follow up surveys. Yesterday, while reading an article about someone, committing suicide, I saw a reference to tinnitus.  Only now do I see many reports online of this side effect.

The patient&#39;s medical history included COPD, congestive heart disease and chronic problems with his back. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 4 Jan 2021, 17 days prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot batch: 026L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021 the patient had an unexpected reaction. He got up that morning and felt fine, but as the day went on, he noticed that when he spoke, the left side of his mouth was not moving, then he noticed his left eye was not closing and that side of his face was drooping. He was not in any pain at that point. He made an appointment to see his general doctor the next day, 22 Jan 2021, after the exam he was diagnosed him with Bell&#39;s Palsy (BP) and referred him to a neurologist and ophthalmologist. The earliest he could see the ophthalmologist back was next week and he could not get the neuro to call him back. His doctor prescribed him prednisone which he completed after 7 days but said the BP symptoms have not improved. Then on Saturday, 30 Jan 2021, he started feeling extreme pain behind his left ear. Everyday the pain got worse. His pain medications were not helping the pain behind his left ear. He could not see out of his left eye and he could not blink.

                                                About one hour after the shot I experienced a very mild, but noticeable, tingling sensation on my lips/mouth.  I did not notice any tingling on my tongue or throat, or anywhere else on my body.  The tingling sensation  last about three hours and never recurred.

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

                                                About 2 hours after receiving the COVID shot, while seated in my recliner, watching TV, I began to feel a sickened feeling with tightness in my chest and heart area.  The sensation lasted for about 15 minutes then completely subsided.  About 4 hours later upon retiring to bed before falling asleep, I began to experience a abnormal sound in both my ears.  I covered my ears and the sound remained unchanged.  I do suffer tinnitus and am used to ringing in my ears.  This was more of a rushing metallic sound similar to the rushing water but high pitched and metallic.  This anomaly lasted for around 30 minutes.

                                                I had very severe cf starting in 1996.  It remained severe for approximately 5 years after which it was semi acute for another 5 years.    After that i would have periodic relapses several times a year for varying lengths of time.  For the last 10 years irt has been much better with occasional symptoms.  However i received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine on february 23, 2021 and had a strong flu like response.  I am now experiencing a mild to moderate relapse of my cf.   brain fog, difficulty tracking with my vision, chills, etc.  when i had severe cf i had this symptom where my scalp would feellike it was in a spasm.  That has returned.  I have dealt with tcf long enough to know when it occurs and this is definitely a response to the covid vaccine.

                                                He complained of dizziness the evening of the shot.  He went to bed and when he woke up the next morning he was having double vision.  Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

The pharmacist was called and the patient reported feeling  light headed and dizzy. While talking the pharmacist the patients eyes rolled back in his head. The pharmacist held his shoulders and his hand and continued to speak to the patient. He regained consciousness. The patient was able to move to his knees and then to lie on his back on the floor with his feet elevated. The injection site was clear and smooth. He had no fever. After resting 15 minutes his color improved and was conversing well. He was able to sit up and his blood pressure was taken. His blood pressure was within normal range. He sat for another 15 min and drank some juice. He was feeling well enough to go home in the care of his wife.

I assumed these were  some of the symptoms as a result of the vaccine. I monitored my fever for several hours. The cough persisted for the next 9 plus days and I didn&#39;t have any desire to eat or drink liquids. I lost my taste and smell during this 9 day period. On February 25 my wife and I took a Covid-19 self test at pharmacy. Also on this same date I went to urgent care My wife was concerned about my labored breathing.  My vitals were checked and I requested a chest xray. I was given 2 prescriptions. 1 for Prednisone 20mg and Ventolin.

I hit the ground on the right side of my head which effected my left ear and a lot of hearing loss. I?m theorizing that the moderna vaccine has triggered something and now my inner or middle right ear is pulsating. I?m thinking it?s blood flow I?m hearing. But whatever it is, it?s annoying

                                                He got his vaccine, within 24 hours later he had hives, his lips and face swelled up, he had a low grade temp of 99.8 having chills and wanting to stay warm and lay in bed with multiple  blankets.  After his daughter noticed it about 2 hours later they went to the ER, and they gave him a steroid, Benadryl and a steroid and gave him IV Pepcid until the swelling went down and he felt better.   They gave him 6 days worth of Benadryl, and steroids which he did take for that.  After 6 days and after 24 hours he broke again in the same manner and they told him that it was okay as long as he was breathing well.  He then went to the UC and he bought OTC Benadryl which he continued.  Then exactly 30 days after he went to the ER on 4/24/21 he broke again with the lips swelling, hives, temperature was normal but feeling achy and the same symptoms he had from the beginning.  He went to his PCP and he has him now on steroids, Benadryl and the Pepcid when needed as well.  He takes the Benadryl as needed and then the symptoms subside and the reaction comes back.   If he does not do the Benadryl until later this evening then his lips will start tightening and then swell.

                                                Swollen lips and a extreme soreness of the skin on the inner lips. Areas of the inner lip skin seemed to blister as if burned and sloughed off. No, I have never had lip fillers, botox or other lip injections. My care provider prescribed a 6 day steroid pack. The swelling stopped  and reversed shortly after the first dose was taken. My inner lip skin healed and was normal after 5 days. I would like to know if your recommendation as to whether I should get the second shot or not? I&#39;m sure I could get the steroid pack in advance in case I have a similar reaction to the second shot.

When I finally opened them everything looked crystallized, I couldn?t see the tv which was on but it was brighter in that area, I couldn?t make out anything. I closed my eyes for a few minutes and opened them with the same results. I closed my eyes about 4 times and then finally I could make out everything .  The only thing different that I took was the vaccine and a packet of Thera Flu.    Nothing else has happened since except a sore arm which lasted 4 days

                                                Significant increase in tinnitus starting about 10 days after the injection. First observed in right ear and then in the left ear.

                                                pt stated that later the day after receiving the vax that he started having pain on the left side of his head.  The pain went from jaw to temple.  He wasn&#39;t able to speak for 3 days.  On 2/17/2021 he went to the hospital.  They thought he may have Bell&#39;s Palsy so the they did a XRAY and CT.  They were not able to find anything other than facial swelling so he was discharged and told to come back if he did not get better and they would make him an appt w/ an ENT.  He started taking Aleve.  He no longer has constant pain but his mouth still hurts when he opens it.  He will contact his PCP to let her know what happened and to let her know that he will not be taking his 2nd covid vax dose.

Neighbor reported significant swelling around tongue and lips, and ability to faintly speak. Neighbor administered epi-pen, but unsure if it worked, so administered a 2nd epi-pen. Within a minute or two after the 2nd dose, patient slumped over and became non-responsive. EMS was called and neighbor began CPR. EMS reported that patient was non-responsive upon arrival. A King airway was placed and a Lucas device used for chest compressions. Three rounds of epinephrine were administered during transport to the local emergency room. Patient remained unresponsive with evidence of PEA during transport. Arrival at the ER occurred ~ 4:25pm. On arrival patient noted to be unresponsive with CPR in progress. Dose of epinephrine administered ~ 3 minutes after arrival in ER. No femoral pulse palpable, cardiac monitor did show some electrical activity. Evaluation of oral cavity showed significant swelling of tongue. Additional dose of epinephrine given. Patient remained with no palpable central pulse and showed continued evidence of PEA. Patient was estimated to have been down &gt; 45 minutes. Patient pronounced deceased at 4:59pm.

                                                12 days after his second Moderna COVID vaccine, my father developed Shingles. His left eyelid is incredibly swollen and his right eyelid began to swell today. That is his only symptom. He?s on an antiviral and gabapentin. He had received both doses of his shingles vaccines about 3 years prior. We have no idea if related to COVID vaccine but wanted to make you all aware.

                                                ?I recd the first moderna vaccine 2-13-2021 at 11 AM.  Headache, right side only, started same day at 7:30 PM, sore shoulder at vaccine site about 10:30 PM same day.  Both were gone the next morning.  I recd the second dose of the moderna vaccine 3-13-2021 at 11 AM.  By 2 PM I had a ranging head ache, again right side only.  I drove four hours to the vaccination site, hospital.  I was driving home when this started.  I stopped to purchase Tylenol about 3 pm which it turns out had no effect.  I was driving west into a setting sun, as the headache got worse, my eyes became more and more sensitive to the sun, I stopped a second time to purchase a second pair of sunglasses that I could wear over the first pair, that didn?t help, I ended up stopping at a rest area until the sun set.  I got to my house at about 6 PM, by then I could no longer wear my prescription glasses, besides the headache I was now very dizzy.  At about 9 PM the pain started, between my shoulder blades first, never at the injection site.  From that time on, including today, the pain has constantly moved around my body, the worst pain is associated with areas that arthritis affects me, hips, knees, hands, ankles.  I have had a mild fever, ranging from 100.9 Saturday night to 100.3 now at11 AM 3-15-2021.  Yesterday, 3-14, my head was swearing, my feet were ice cold.  I had an electric blanket from my waist down and an ice pack on head.  If I have ever felt worse in my life I don?t remember when that would have been.  The pain has moderated today, I expect the worst is now over.    If as the health specialists are suggesting a booster will be required this fall I will undoubtedly have incredibly significant reservations with this vaccine.

About one week after the second dose I noticed that the ringing in my ears is much louder, probably a four or five. I can think of no other reason other than the vaccine for this to occur.   The increased volume has not subsided over the past four days.  I have not required medical attention for this event.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                Started getting ringing in my ears about 5 or 6 days after getting my second injection of the Moderna vaccine on March 7th. I received the first injection on February 7th. I didn&#39;t notice any side effects  from the first shot other than minor soreness in the injection site of my left arm. I had minor soreness with the second shot as well but it was less than the first. I did take two 400 mg Anacin plus caffeine (32mg) 3 days before my second shot for a sinus headache I  had at the time. I am going to see my ear, nose and throat doctor this Friday 3/26 to have him check me out and maybe get a hearing test if he thinks it&#39;s necessary.

                                                Felt fine after injection, walked 5 miles home &amp; assured loved ones before going to bed that vaccination went fine with no side effects. After midnight I woke in the dark with many of the same symptoms as when I had COVID in March/April 2020: extreme allover body aches, terrible thirst, extreme weakness.  Next day (Wednesday) symptoms continued; too weak &amp; achy to watch all but the core parts of the inauguration; too uncomfortable to read or to concentrate on music or anything else.  Absolutely no appetite so I didn&#39;t eat.  Wednesday night I tossed &amp; turned all night with a chill that I couldn&#39;t lose even with the heaviest down comforter &amp; supplementary blankets.  That night &amp; the following day I also noticed a distorted sense of time, where hours seem to pass v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y.  On Thursday night two more symptoms appeared: a tremendous cough that I couldn&#39;t stop or assuage with the normal remedies (e.g., lozenges, tea with honey), and that kept me from falling asleep till dawn; and diarrhea (which was limited because I hadn&#39;t eaten since Monday dinner so I didn&#39;t have much food in my system).  The cough felt like it might develop into a sore throat (which had been my first symptom when I had COVID) but it never did.  Yesterday (Friday) I felt as if my symptoms (other than residual weakness) were abating, and Friday night I got a full night of unbroken sleep.  I awoke on Saturday morning with no symptoms, and felt well enough to challenge myself by attempting my usual 90-minute yoga/stretch workout, which proved to be no problem.  Now, at 4 pm on Saturday--about 100 hours after my shot--I feel fairly normal &amp; seem to have no further symptoms.  I do plan to lie low &amp; take things easy, and to have as little outside contact as possible between now and my second shot (scheduled for 2/16) in order to minimize the possibility of re-infection.

HCP approached vehicle where a 68yo white male was sitting in his vehicle on the driver side. Quick assessment revealed erythema of the face and angioedema. Pt was able to speak clearly, was CTA and had RRR. 911 was called. BP 160/90.  EpiPen dose 1 was injected into right vastus lateralis and pt reported improvement at 1057.  HCP asked for injectable diphenhydramine. HCP continued to monitor pt with RRR and CTA but erythema and angioedema began again along with swollen tongue so EpiPen dose 2 was injected into right vastus lateralis. 50mg IM diphenhydramine was injected into the right deltoid while fire rescue began to arrive on scene. Pt did not report difficulty breathing. Pt did report previous anaphylaxis to fire ant bites/stings and did report being allergic to bee stings. Fire rescue transported patient without difficulty. HCP called pt later that night at 2030 who reported doing better but still having tongue swelling.

                                                Neck pain near the top of the neck at the base of the skull slightly to the right of the center began around Feb 1. Began taking Ibuprofin, but it did not go away.  Thought I had muscle strain, but surprisingly there was no stiffness or loss of motion. Tried massage, heat, and cold packs with limited relief. Began interfering with sleep over the next few days. On the evening of Feb 4, I noticed a strange sensation on the right side of my tongue as if I was losing taste or feeling there. At 3 AM got out o bed due to neck pain and noticed right eye felt strange and was drooping. When I got up at 8 AM I saw eye droop and smile was only on one side of mouth. Called my doctor and was directed to an advice nurse who told me to go to the ER right away, since this could be a stroke or Bell&#39;s Palsy. Went to ER and was diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy after blood tests, EKG, CT scan, and tests of limbs. Given medications and and released with prescriptions sent to CVS for prednisone and valacyclovir.

                                                Beginning about 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I started having really bad headaches, behind my eyes radiating to the back of the head. At about   15 hours post vaccine I had chills, fever. The chills and fever were bad enough that in addition to sleeping under two blankets I had to put on a thick fleece ?hoodie? and pulled the hoodie over my head. I developed about 48 hrs of nasal congestion, and some retrosternal chest pain. I had one episode of nausea with vomiting about 8:00 am the next morning. I had to take two 325 mg Tylenol every 4-6 hrs to deal with the headache and fever. The most severe symptoms of  headache and fever subsided in about 24 to 36 hrs after the vaccine was administered. I had a lot of fatigue for several days, along with aches and pains. It took me about 5 days to really start feeling normal again, but the fatigue lingered for a few more days.

                                                The day of my second Vaccine 02/11/2021 at around 5:00 PM I was feeling fine and was sitting in the toilet and pulled my pants down and was horrified to see my whole sexual organ inflated. I quickly took Benadryl and a few hours later it started to get back to normal. It did not hurt or anything but slowly got back to normal. The next day 02/112/2021 I was itching on the right side of my stomach and had a big red bump. I kept taking Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for the next 7 days because otherwise as soon as i stopped taking the medicine I would have itching and bumps in my arms and side of my stomach. I had my lips swollen, my right eye lid droop. I still have episodes of itching and bumps  16 days after vaccine

It lasted for 24 hours, and another 12 hours of  and extreme stomach ache.

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

Had pain in the right lower jaw below a dental implant and pain below the hip in the right ischium (in the hip with an artificial hip replacement).  The jaw pain disappeared in 2 weeks, and the hip pain still evident after 3 weeks.  X-ray of right hip revealed no abnormalities.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                Friday evening, pt. was shaking so much that he could not even hold on to anything, had pain in his legs, hips, joints, knees to where he could not walk, and had a fever.  He had a hard time breathing as well so he went to the hospital.  They checked him out and ran tests but it was all in relation to the shot they thought.  Saturday he was very tired that he slept all day.  Sunday he was feeling better but had some issues with his vision and his peripheral vision went away for part of the day.

                                                I experienced this after both the first and second doses.  Within one to two minutes after the injection a burning sensation of the tongue and mucus membrane lining of the nostrils developed which then persisted for 36 hours after the first injection and at least that long after the second injection (still ongoing at the 36 hour mark).  The burning sensation was more intense after the second injection compared to the first.

                                                On March 13, I woke with a headache, a sinus pain, and generally feeling exhausted and groggy.  This persisted through Sunday.  On Tuesday March 16 I awoke and could not focus my eyes: I was seeing double.  This got better during the course of the day but I could not work on my computer.  On Wednesday March 17, I woke with double vision again.  During the day I gradually became able to focus if I looked at an object, but as soon as I move my eyes, it was back to double vision.  I felt much better physically that day.

                                                Have had tinnitus for a number of years, but the volume has always been at a reasonable level such that it was never disabling.  I was awakened on the morning of March 24th by considerably louder tinnitus ringing in both ears and was unable to sleep thereafter.  This condition persisted throughout the day, causing significant stress and anxiety and making normal function extremely difficult.  That night, I was unable to sleep at all.  Though the volume has diminished somewhat, it is still close to being at a debilitating level, making normal function exceedingly difficult.  Receiving the vaccine was the only change in my normal routine, so I am attributing this condition to that.At this point, I have determined not to get the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Late afternoon on February 18 I developed a rash on my upper arms.  The rash is worse on the upper right arm.  Over the course of the evening and night the rash spread over most of my body including wrists, upper and lower legs, ankles and butt.  In addition, my lips are swollen and the taste on my lips is salty. This morning I applied topical Benadryl to the affected areas and took two Benadryl (Allergy) tablets (25 mg).  This seems to relieve the itching which is not severe and my swollen lips may be receding.   I plan to continue with this treatment and hopefully the rash and swollen lips will subside in a day or two.

Dateline and symptoms:  03/01 Received first Moderna Covid Vaccination at 3:45 p.m... 03/02 No symptoms until 6 p.m. When blood pressure started to go up from my normal level of 116/68 to 179/82 by 10 p.m..  During this time I had what felt like mild electric currents from the left side of my chest down my left arm and into my hand.  These systems subsided around 11 p.m. and by midnight my blood pressure was almost back to normal. 03/03 Felt sluggish all day but no blood pressure problems. 03/04 Felt great all day then around 6 p.m. my blood pressure started to rise, by 9:30 p.m. it was 190/90.  At this time I started to feel like my body was shutting down, my face felt flush, and experiencing long distant vision problems, so I had my wife take me to the emergency room. At 10:00 p.m. I went to the emergency room  EKG  showed no heart problems, the blood test showed no heart problems, and after 11:30 p.m. my blood pressure started going down and I was released at 1:30 a.m..  Blood test did show high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen 26.0, Bun/Creatinine Ratio 33.0, Aspartate Amino Tranf (AST/SGOT) 43, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) 59 and Alkaline Phosphatase 189, all of which are higher than my last blood test on 10/22/20. 03/05  As of 10:30 a.m. my blood pressure is 126/62.  I feel fine except I&#39;m very tired from not much sleep last night.  1p.m. Starting to feel some more chest and arm symptoms as described before, blood pressure now 146/66. Events happened twice, 2 days apart.

Friday the rash was complete from the top of my feet into my scalp, including inner thighs. Rash not in pubic area or on glutes. Rash was acting like hives with intense itching. At noon on Friday, my lips had swollen. My tongue did not swell. I had no difficulty breathing., no shortness of breath. Contacted Dr. via patient portal. Suggested protocol was colloidal oatmeal baths as needed, discontinue Valacyclovir, take second Aller Clear mid-day, and Benadryl at night. Protocol followed through the weekend, but by Tuesday, the itching was very intense. Made appointment to see Dr. on Thursday 2/25. He prescribed a six day course of Prednisone 10mg and taking hydroxyzine HCL 25mg 3 times daily to relieve itching.  By the second day (2/27) symptoms had abated. Colloidal baths  and anti-itch tablets discontinued. Finished Prednisone Rx.

                                                On 3/24 by 9:25 PM I had mild shakes. At about 10:00 PM my lips stared to tingle and become numb. Subsequently I began to have difficulty swallowing as well as experiencing some sub sternal pain. Went to get my Epipen and put it beside me in bed. Difficulty swallowing got a bit worse but as I was not experiencing shortness of breath I held off the Epinephrine injection. (What on earth was I thinking?!)The &#34;semi anaphylaxis&#34; was self limiting and by 11:00 PM symptoms had subsided completely. But by approximately 11:30 MP I had severe rigors lasting about 3 - 5 minutes. On 3/25 I developed a severe headache and a low grade T (T-max 99.9). Took Tylenol 825mg with good effect. The following night I had severe night sweats, drenching 3 sets of pajamas. Today, on 3/26 I have been experiencing several cold sweats and I am altogether feeling &#34;strange&#34; (can&#39;t put my finger on it - maybe dehydration?). Have vegan to aggressively hydrate. Notified my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office. Agreed to &#34;ride it out&#34; for now. Shall see my PPP on

                                                cranial nerve deficit  4, 6,9, 10, 11, 12; tongue deviation to right; double vision; tongue biting; difficulty swallowing; This spontaneous case was reported by a physician (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES MULTIPLE (cranial nerve deficit  4, 6,9, 10, 11, 12) and TONGUE PARALYSIS (tongue deviation to right) in a 70-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 025L20A and 021L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history was not provided.  Concomitant products included ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM (LIPITOR), LISINOPRIL, ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE GEL, DRIED, MAGNESIUM CARBONATE (PEPCID [ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE GEL, DRIED;MAGNESIUM CARBONATE]), OMEPRAZOLE, NEBIVOLOL HYDROCHLORIDE (BYSTOLIC) and COENZYME Q10 [UBIDECARENONE] for an unknown indication.   On 06-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form.  On 03-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form.   On an unknown date, the patient experienced deficit in the cranial nerves 4, 6, 9, 10, 11,12 after been vaccinated with 1st dose of Moderna Vaccine and difficulty with mouth which resulted in him biting his tongue. The patient&#39;s tongue deviates to the right, double vision, difficulty swallowing (swallow test was negative). Physical Exam, CTA to rule dissection (result was negative), Stroke tests were negative. MRI with/without contrast of the brain &amp; upper spinal cord which was conducted twice and the results were normal. the patient is undergoing a neurophysiology count (result is pending)  The patient experienced CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES MULTIPLE (cranial nerve deficit  4, 6,9, 10, 11, 12) (seriousness criterion medically significant), TONGUE PARALYSIS (tongue deviation to right) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIPLOPIA (double vision), TONGUE BITING (tongue biting) and DYSPHAGIA (difficulty swallowing). At the time of the report, CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES MULTIPLE (cranial nerve deficit  4, 6,9, 10, 11, 12), TONGUE PARALYSIS (tongue deviation to right), DIPLOPIA (double vision), TONGUE BITING (tongue biting) and DYSPHAGIA (difficulty swallowing) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Computerised tomogram: negative (Negative) Negative. On an unknown date, Magnetic resonance imaging brain: normal (normal) Normal. On an unknown date, Magnetic resonance imaging spinal: normal (normal) Normal. On an unknown date, Physical examination: negative (Negative) Negative.    For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient had difficulty swallowing (swallow test was negative), stroke tests were negative. His Neuro-physiologist is doing a neurophysiology count (result is pending).  No treatment information was provided.   Reporter did not allow further contact; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a causal association between the reported event and cranial nerves deficit is assessed as unlikely based on diagnostic test.  However, based on temporality, causality with the other reported events of dysphagia, tongue biting and deviation and double vision cannot be excluded.

On 19 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 029L20A) in the left arm for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.   The patient had some mild soreness at the site of the injection which lasted one to two days. On 21 Jan 2021, he experienced some ear ringing in his right ear which was followed by hearing loss that lasted six hours. Both the ear ringing and hearing loss resolved by the next morning.   On 24 Jan 2021, the patient had ringing in his left ear, but it was not associated with hearing loss. The patient stated he thinks the tromethamine hydrochloride in the vaccine may have induced his hearing loss. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, hearing loss in right ear and ear ringing in right ear, were considered resolved on 22 Jan 2021. The event, mild soreness at the site of injection, was considered resolved on an unknown date Jan 2021. The outcome for the event, ringing in left ear, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71- year old male patient who experienced hearing loss in right ear/deafness unilateral, ear ringing in right ear/tinnitus, ringing in left ear/tinnitus, and mild soreness at the site of injection/injection site pain, all within 4 days after administration of Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273). Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I tried different brands of coffee, different sources of water, and different coffee makers and still tasted bad. I have no clue if this was related to vaccine.

It improved over next week only to reappear after second vaccine and in this case took 6 weeks to disappear. It was painful and verified by two dentists who saw lesion.  I also develop three days after second vaccine, pain in right calf region and numbness in my right foot involving lateral toes and heel region. the pain disappeared within hours but the numbness has remained, now 6 weeks ater though is less than initially,   After both the first and second vaccinations, I had hemorrhagic sinusitis that lasted at least two weeks with significant drainage resulting in cough.   I had two negative Covid tests after first vaccine to confirm this was vaccine related and I had not contracted Covid.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

I rushed him to the emergency hospital they ran cat scans, MRI, heart tests etc. He stayed overnight while they checked. The next day we went to eye doctor who told him he had a eye stroke. He would regain some of his site not all of it. Something to do with blood clot or loss of blood to the eye. I was not satisfied with that so made another drs appointment for the next day with a different eye doctor. The first eye doctor gave us some blood test to do so we did it then. Later that evening we got an emergency call form the first eye doctor to get back to the hospital right away he could lose sight in the other eye.. They found some high c-reactive protein. Normal is 8 his was over 40. They put him on heavy steroids and did biopsy on both temples of his eyes. This started last Wednesday morning. He was released from the hospital Monday Morning to see his regular doctor that afternoon. Test results for the eye would be Tuesday and all other vital tests came back fine thank goodness. On Tuesday the biopsy tests also came back negative so they are stopping steroids. I think they were looking for auto immune issues. Today we are going to Rheumatologist

After a couple of days my mouth improved. My mouth was almost well by Feb16. On Feb 10 I received the Moderna covid boster vaccine.  On Feb 17 my mouth again became numb and swollen. As of this date 2/22/2021 my mouth is again improving and is nearly well. I visited my Primary Care Doctor on Feb 19, 2021. We decided to wait and see if this gets better on its own. If not I will see an Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist.

                                                Got the vaccine and had soreness in the arm and felt great, and on Saturday 3/6/21 late afternoon his head hurt to touch his hair.  He knew what it was from previous experience.  Was on the top of his head to the right rear predominantly, probably 4&#34; or so.  It was painful and tied into his right eye as he was photophobic with this as well and sunlight would affect that and would get a spasm of pain/2 second or so in the top of his head.  These events continued intermittently until Tuesday 3/9/21 when it was gone, but on his right tricep has a scraping sore feeling on it, which still continues as of today 3/16/21, but only faintly.

On 16th March at 7:30 am I started to feel dizzy and out of balance and then suddenly my hearing in my right ear went and I had a sort of wind noise in my ear but no hearing. At approximately 1:00pmmy wife called our Doctor and he said that this could be a rare side effect of the Covid Vaccine and to allow up to 24 hours for the effect to resolve itself. By 4:00pm.the effect did resolve itself but returned at 10:00amon 18th March and lasted for 4 hours. Since then I have been OK with no further effects.

                                                Numbness in lower lip and numbness and slight trembling in right side of face (similar to Bells Palsy?) after four days of being administered the first shot in the right arm. After a video consult with my PCP it was recommended that I go to the hospital and get a CT scan to rule out a possible minor stroke. The CT scan was negative. The numbness became better after two weeks but has not subsided.  After consultation with the doctor in charge of the vaccine operation for the site it was decided that I go ahead and take the second shot but instead of the right arm I should take it in either the left arm or the left thigh. The second shot was administered in the left thigh. I experienced the typical symptoms on the second day - fever, chills and aches and pain but they went away towards the end of the second day. However, exactly on the fourth day I experienced increased numbness in my lower lip and on the right side of my face. Today is the fifth day and it is still there. I expect that this numbness will continue for several weeks as it did with the first shot and so far it has not subsided after the first shot and has now increased after the second shot. I am totally convinced that this is a direct result of the vaccine.

Patient was given bamlanivimab on 3/1/21 in the ED and was discharged home. Returned to ED on  3/3/21 for worsening symptoms and inability to maintain O2 sats above 90%. Admitted to hospital for 6 days.

                                                Loss of hearing in his right ear; A spontaneous report was received from a 73-year-old, male, patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced hearing loss in right ear.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt in his head. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 12 Jan 2021, approximately two days prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, the patient had dental work done where four crowns were prepped and temporaries were put in, he then lost hearing in his right ear. Treatment information was not provided. He thinks that the loss of hearing might be due to this dental procedure as they were drilling for hours. He states that he has a VP shunt in this head which needs readjustments occasionally. He is seeing his neurosurgeon for the readjustment.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event, hearing loss in right ear, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73 year-old, male patient with history of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt in his head, who experienced event of hearing loss in right ear. The event occurred 2 days after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event is assessed as possibly related.  However, on the same day and prior to the onset of the event, the patient had extensive dental procedures done which may provide an alternative explanation for the event.

                                                I first noticed a buzzing in my ears on February 28th driving home from out of town.  My wife said she had static-like noises and asked me if I heard it too.  She thought there might be something wrong with our car radio.  I said I did, so she turned off the radio to see if it would go away, but we both still heard it.  We have both had this symptom several times since then, often at the same time but not always.

                                                Received the vaccine on Thursday 3/11 3:15PM.  Around 2PM on Friday 3/12, noticed that my right jaw was feeling sore when I chewed on things.  Didn&#39;t think much of it until dinner time when my jaw hurt everytime I took a bite of food.  Couldn&#39;t think of anything I did to cause it, and assumed it would get better soon. On Saturday, my jaw was still sore when I had lunch, but maybe a little better.  But then at dinner time it was back to hurting again.  Sunday it was still sore when  I had lunch.  By then I was starting to attribute it to possibly being the vaccine I received on 3/11, even though there was no mention of this as a side effect on any of the sheets I received when I got my vaccine.  I then signed-up to v-safe to see what they might offer. Then I called the on-call nurseline (where I got the shot).  An RN called back and we went over everything, and at the end she recommended I go into an Emergency room to get checked out because jaw paint can possibly mean heart issues or other things to be concerned about.  I was very surprised about her recommendation, but decided to take her advice.  Went to an emergency clinic.   While I was in the waiting room, a woman who was also waiting said she heard me talking about the reason I was in and said her husband had experienced the same symptoms after his Covid vaccine that I did!  He had a Moderna shot on 2/27 and then several days later his right jaw got sore.  He went to the doctor on 3/8 and they said he had TMJ, but the next day his pain went away and he has been ok since.  They examined me, took blood for Troponin, did an EKG.  All looked OK.  I told them about the person in the waiting room and her husband and they said they weren&#39;t aware that this was an issue with this vaccine.  They sent me home and said to monitor and follow-up with my family doctor if it persists.  As of today,  I am still having the pain in my right jaw.  It has stayed the same since it started - no better/no worse.  I suspect of there are 2 of us with this symptom, there are probably many others.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

This occurred starting 3- 4 days after the 1st vaccine and worsened over a two week period.

                                                On 26 Feb R eye became clouded.  By the 28th, I had lost all sight in R eye.  Suspected I had a torn retina, as I had in L eye several years earlier, I made an appointment on the 26th to see my optometrist.  I saw him on 3 March where he diagnosed that I had a more serious problem.  At that time some of my R eye sight had returned but I could only see the top line in the chart.  He made an appointment that day for me to see an ophthalmologist.  She checked me out.  I had a severely inflamed optic nerve in the R eye and my L eye optic nerve was inflamed but not to the extent of the Right one.  I was sent to get an echo cardiogram and a carotid artery ultrasound.  I was referred to a neurologist ophthalmologist but couldn&#39;t get in until March 12.  On March 10th I was told to go to the ER room for a workup prior to my 12 March appointment.  I got an MRI CAT scan, lots of blood work, etc.  I&#39;m running out of time to finish this.

                                                Second day (Tuesday 1/5/21) swelling and some soreness on inside of throat right side. Wednesday 1/6/21 swelling had spread significantly to inside the right side of mouth and tongue also affecting right jaw. By 3 Pm that day my tongue was numb and swollen on the right side as well as the right side of my mouth and jaw. I could only chew, eat, and swallow effectively on the left side of my mouth using the left side of my tongue to negotiate eating.  I could only this with small amounts of food. By that evening about 4 hours later I could eat , chew etc. pretty good but the swelling &amp; discomfort remained but reduced to a functional level.  Today, Thursday 1/7/21, the soreness and discomfort remains inside throat, mouth, tongue and jaw all on the right side.

                                                I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for covid 19 on December 9, 2020 as a participant in the study program.  I am a board crtified family physician. Beginning about 12 hours after the Moderna vaccine, I became fatigued, feverish (99.1) , ached in the thighs and calves, and had a 2-3 hour salty taste triggering thirst. The injection site became very tender but there was no inflammation nor rash.   All symptoms resolved on awakening 9:00 am 1/8/21.

Patient called on 2/5/2021 stating he had some tongue numbness and eye swelling about 30 minutes after the injection.  He did not seek emergency care, did not take any OTC medications. Phone call to patient 2/8/2021 he states on his ride home after the first injection he noticed that the top of his tongue became numb and he developed some swelling around the edge of my eyes and the back of my tongue felt thick.  He went home and took a nap. When he woke up, he felt great.  No swelling around eyes, tongue was not numb nor did it feel thick any longer.  Patient tells me he has had a reaction like this before to a chemo enhancing medication, he does not remember the name. Patient states he still wants to receive the second dose.

On Wednesday 2/3/2021 I noticed a large amount of long and moving floaters in the ight eye, swirling, growing and then fading - like someone poured a stream of ink in water. By Friday 2/4/2021 unable to focus from right eye and went to Ophthalmologist for eye exam; He made arrangements to send me to a clinic in and I will see them on Wednesday 2/10/2021. I don&#39;t know whether or not this is related to the COVID vaccine but it is the only unusual event that has occurred in the last 45 days.

Swelling went down, and I went home about 4:00 pm.  I had no problems at home.  I saw my family doctor the next day.

No muscle ache. After vaccination I lifted weights, stretched arm and took very cold and very warm showers on the area. My theory was dispurse the concentration to avoid the muscle ache. Maybe so. But it may have lead to full body adverse event.  I call it &#34;corona light.&#34;   yesterday I rec&#39;d 015M20A. so far left arm site slightly swollen, aches, small pain with light touch (avoiding any movement of arm). so far so good.

                                                Extreme sensitivity / intolerance to  loud sounds.  During the cleaning of  my house by people who have been doing it for years I found that the sounds of a vacuum cleaner working and normal conversations between the cleaners and my wife and daughter became almost intolerable.  I was unable to concentrate on work I was doing and had to go to a room where those sounds were significantly less.  I have never before experience this intolerance to customary sound levels.  The intolerance passed within about three hours of when I noticed it.

                                                The day following the first dose of the vaccine I felt a slight itch at site of injection. Then on 2/22 at 3:00am I was woken up with swelling on both upper and lower lips. In the morning I observed a large red rash below the injection site, approximately 2 inches round. Later that day I observed welts or hives on both arms, my back, both upper and lower. They were very itchy.  I took 2 capsules (25mg each) of  Allergy Relief (diphenhydramine HCL) twice a day for 4 days and applied  Pain Relief Cream (4% lidocaine) to all itchy areas after showering and before retiring at night to relieve the itching.  The swelling in my lips receded and the rash on my right arm faded. I stopped taking the pills for the next 2 days, but the itch remained so I took the pills at the same dosage and applied the cream as described above for 3 more days and now all symptoms have resolved except for some mild periodic itching on my upper back.

                                                Received first vaccine at about 330 PM. on 1/19.  On Thursday, my left eye got really red and I had some blurring of vision.    I had a regularly scheduled eye doctor appointment the following Monday  1/25 and I waited until then to get checked out.  My eye pressure in my right eye was 18, a few ticks above what it has been running.  The eye pressure in my left eye was 45, extremely high.  My eye doctor prescribed some steroids&#39;  and other eye pressure drops and he wanted to see me the next morning.  By then I had three does of these new drops.  The next morning my right eye pressure dropped to 16 and my left eye, the problem eye dropped to 10.  We kept eye drop regiment for two weeks and set another appointment following my second vaccine shot to see if there was a reaction.  It turns out that my left eye pressure was 11.  Now we don&#39;t knw if virus vaccine was responsible or not.  However the vaccine shots were the only new events in my life, so it became highly suspicious.

                                                I vaccinated the pt who stated he only had a sore arm with the first vaccine and no other reaction and that he had never had any kind of severe reaction to drugs, vaccines, or foods.  Approximately 5-10 minutes after vaccinating Client, I was informed that his top lip was swelling as he sat in our Waiting Area.  I immediately went to check on him and observed visible swelling of the middle of his top lip.  I asked if he had noticed any other swelling, trouble swallowing, or breathing, to which he replied he did not.  I then when to check with the pharmacist running the clinic to verify the best way to proceed.  I was prepared with an Epipen a few feet away from pt to use if needed. Another pharmacist, brought over an ice pack. Pharmacist again questioned the pt who affirmed he had no other symptoms and that the swelling did not appear to be spreading.  We offered to call 911 and the pt declined, insisting that we not make a fuss.  We insisted that we wanted to make sure he did not have any trouble breathing or any other reaction and to sit for 30 minutes of observation.  Pt accepted the ice pack and reluctantly agreed to sit for &#34;a while&#34;.  I sat with the pt monitoring him closely for about 30 minutes and engaged him in conversation.  Pt had no issues breathing or speaking and repeatedly stated that it was not itchy or painful and the swelling had receded minimally after 30 minutes.  He experienced no other symptoms, but was tired and wanted to go home,  He explained that he had his colon removed this past Monday and was in some discomfort and was very tired.  The patient was eager to leave and again declined further medical treatment.  I provided the patient with generic benadryl tablets since he he did not have any at home.  I instructed him to go home, take 2 tablets with a big glass of water, and take his nap. I asked if I could call him later this afternoon to follow-up with him and he approved.  I told him that I would report the incident here.  I also told him that if his symptoms worsened and if he had any trouble breathing to call 911.  The patient then left the Waiting Area.

                                                Patient received vaccination at clinic and was in the waiting area for the 15 minute monitoring time. About 5 minutes into the waiting time, patient said he was getting light headed. It was noticed he was taking deep, sharp breaths causing his mask to go in his mouth. We switched him to a chair with arms and asked him to remove his jacket and called 911 as a precautionary as the breathing pattern was not improving.  EMS arrived to ask the patient how he was feeling and he said he had a dry mouth and was thirsty. At this time, it was aout 15 minutes after the vaccination. Patient refused transport and asked for water. I asked EMS if that was advisable now that he declined transport and it was beyond the 15 minutes. EMS was still near the patient. Patient was provided water and was able to remove his mask to drink and was much more coherent afterwards. He stayed in the pharmacy area about 20 minutes. He was asked to have his wife drive, which he refused.

                                                I suffer from a mild tinnitus.  On March 26 (Moderna vaccinations 2/10/2021 &amp; 3/10/2021) I awoke to a very loud ringing in both ears.  I noticed a feeling of pressure moving back &amp; forth between ears.  When the pressure sensation was present, my hearing was very much impaired in that ear; bordered on deaf.  This movement back and forth between ears continued.  I contacted a doctor who is a tinnitus specialist (referred by my ENT doc).  Saw him April 2, 2021.  He took a history and ordered another hearing test (I had had a hearing test on March 4, 2021 by ENT doctor)  The 4/2/21 test confirmed that on my hearing was degraded between the two tests.  When  I drove home April 2 the tinnitus &#34;noise&#34; abated a lot, and the deafness was almost gone.  When I awoke April  3, the tinnitus in my left ear had quiet buzz, no pressure, hearing was fine.  The noise in my right ear was severe, the sense of pressure was present, and my hearing was very much impaired.  It has continued through this April 3rd day.

                                                On Monday, 2/22/2021, six days after receiving my first Moderna vaccine, I woke up with double vision.  I have had it ever since (6 weeks today). I received my second Moderna shot at the same place on Tuesday, 3/16/2021 at 10:15 AM at the same location, and on Monday, 3/23/2021, I started having droopy eyelids.  This has occurred every day since.
