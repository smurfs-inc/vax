                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine was administered I experienced the usual side effects of mild headache, fatigue and localized redness and swelling  Around 11pm the night the vaccine was administered I developed a migraine that resulted in blurred vision. and when I checked my temperature it was approximately 104.9 degrees Fahrenheit.By the next morning, approximately 7am, I was weak to the point I could not get out of bed myself, I was nauseous that resulted in a single Emesis episode approximately 8am, I had mild swelling of my face since 7am, between 7:30am and 12pm, I had multiple times where I would temporarily lose my vision. Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

                                                I received my first vaccine as the Pfizer manufacturer, and did not have any side effects. However, when I received my 2nd shot, I received the Modena manufacturer, and have experienced many concerning side effects. Fever, cold chills, trembling, fatigue, that lasted 2 days after the vaccine was administered. The side effect I am still experiencing is a metallic taste in my mouth, that gets worse when I drink water or other beverages. My hands and fingers turned a rust orange color the day after getting the shot and resolved within 48 hours.

Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

                                                Within hours of getting the shot, patients left eye started turning red. He visited a medical facility and they diagnosed him pink eye and gave him antibiotic drops. The drops did not seem to be working and by that Monday he went to see the eye doctor. Eye doctor said it was viral pink eye and thought it was strange that this came about right after the vaccine and in the eye on the same side he was vaccinated. Over the next days and weeks, the viral infection moved to the other eye. Both eyes stayed swollen, red and tearing constantly. He has lost some of his vision and says that things far away are very fuzzy looking. The doctor said it was the worst case of viral pink eye he has ever seen and that he would have it for the long haul of 4 to 6 weeks. He had to do a medical withdrawal from college due to missing too much of the nursing program he is enrolled in. The pinkeye is still ongoing and we don&#39;t know when it will be over.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

                                                A few hours after the injection, I started feeling severe joint and back pain. Around 5 PM is when I started feeling a tingling feeling in my hands, feet, and around the outside of my mouth. I still have a loss of feeling in my feet after returning to work today, 1/25/2021, and I was promptly sent home after informing my management. I still have some loss of feeling around the corners of my mouth, and most of the feeling has recovered in my hands.

The next morning I experienced a less severe headache but experienced noticeable shortness of breath especially on exertion. Tylenol P.O. helped my headache that morning, no known fever.  Approx 2 days after injection I also experienced a noticeable reduction in the ability to smell or taste. This Stayed for at least another day or so.

I was working at the time and went to my local EMS station to get checked out. They checked my blood pressure and blood sugar. Blood pressure was normal but my blood sugar was low, around 68. They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

                                                The morning after I received both vaccine shots, I posted hearing from my right ear. The first time I received the vaccine shot, the morning after, I could barely hear out of my right ear.  It almost sounded like there was a clog or earwax build-up. I didn&#39;t really think much of it and it gradually went away several days later. The worst day was the next day after the vaccine and it lasted, even though in a small amount, until 3 days after. The second dose caused the same problem. The morning after the second dose of the vaccine, I lost my hearing in the same way as before. I could barely hear out of my ear, however, I was also exhausted and ended up sleeping most of the day. When I woke up in the afternoon, I couldn&#39;t hear from my right ear, but I could hear better. (maybe 25% back to normal). The two days after the vaccine, my hearing came back way better than the previous time. It felt like 80% back to normal and later in the today, it felt like it up to 95% back to normal. The best way I can describe the feeling was as if the sound was still being received to my hear, but it sounded muffled and turned down. I was still able to hear the deeper sounds during conversations and deeper &#39;beats&#39; in music, but the sharpness of everything was turned off.

That same night I ran a fever and woke up the next morning feeling ok. I was taking a shower and it was reported to me by my fiancé I had passed out, started to seize, my eyes rolled to the back of my head. A few minutes later I woke up on the floor and asked what had happened. I was not sure what had happened.  I felt fine when I woke up. When first responders arrived they asked me if I knew who I was, the date, the president, where I lived to all I was able to answer correctly. I went to the ER and they did a ECG, blood test, urine test, chest x-ray, CT of my head and they said everything came back normal. I was prescribed Keppra and have an MRI scheduled in the coming week.

The next day the pain in my arm got about 50% better, and the head ache was gone right when I woke up. I still felt tired throughout the 2nd day and my left under eye lid began to start twitching for about a minute long every 30 minutes. On the 3rd day, I was no longer tired and my arm no longer hurt but the under eye lid twitch is still occurring and at the same frequency.
