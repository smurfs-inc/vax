                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine was administered I experienced the usual side effects of mild headache, fatigue and localized redness and swelling  Around 11pm the night the vaccine was administered I developed a migraine that resulted in blurred vision. and when I checked my temperature it was approximately 104.9 degrees Fahrenheit.By the next morning, approximately 7am, I was weak to the point I could not get out of bed myself, I was nauseous that resulted in a single Emesis episode approximately 8am, I had mild swelling of my face since 7am, between 7:30am and 12pm, I had multiple times where I would temporarily lose my vision. Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

However, when I received my 2nd shot, I received the Modena manufacturer, and have experienced many concerning side effects. Fever, cold chills, trembling, fatigue, that lasted 2 days after the vaccine was administered. The side effect I am still experiencing is a metallic taste in my mouth, that gets worse when I drink water or other beverages. My hands and fingers turned a rust orange color the day after getting the shot and resolved within 48 hours.

                                                Patient complained of dizziness immediately after walking to checkout station. We sat him down and he said he was only seeing black and he was got and his neck hurt. We called EMS to check him out also. His BP was 140/90 and his vision started to come back after a couple of minutes as blurry. Once EMS arrived, he was much improved and vitals were all good. He refused to go to the ER, but his roommate assured us that he would watch him today. Patient waited 30 minutes and said he felt totally fine when he left.

                                                Developed &#34;moderna arm&#34; (raised inflammation with itching 1.5-2 inches long and 0.5-1 inches across) 7 days post vaccination from injection 1.   Developed somewhat severe tension headache on day 1 post vaccination from injection 2 (all further events listed below are from injection 2). Headache responded to ibuprofen.  On day 4 post vaccination, began experiencing minor and infrequent migraine-like headaches that lasted for a few seconds to a minute. Moderate pain and localized. Pain site changed but was generally on left side. Experienced 0-2 a day until day 12.  On day 11 post vaccination, began experiencing full, moderate tension headache. In addition, had more frequent migraine-like headaches. Did not respond to 400mg ibuprofen or 10mg Claritin.  On day 12 post vaccination, began experiencing photophobia. Mentioned to general practitioner out of an abundance of caution who recommended Excedrin. Took two Excedrin extra strength (total dosage: Acetomenaphin 500mg, Aspirin 500 mg, Caffeine 130 mg). Tension headache ended and most (but not all) migraine-like pain subsided. Some occasional pain ranging from 1-2 out of 10.  On day 13 out of an abundance of caution following reports of other events I went to the ER. The doctor there examined for any cognitive symptoms (asked me to follow her finger with my eyes, squeeze fingers, checked ability to move extremities, etc) and concluded no risk of CVST. Determined that vaccine likely lowered my threshold for headaches and migraines (I have had very infrequent cluster headaches lasting for a few seconds in the past, never for this duration). Final diagnosis was migraines. Doctor prescribed Fioricet and gave me a long-acting steroid. Some pain is still there, but symptoms have mostly stopped. Waves of quick bursts of pain on localized areas on the left side of my head are still occuring.

                                                Within hours of getting the shot, patients left eye started turning red. He visited a medical facility and they diagnosed him pink eye and gave him antibiotic drops. The drops did not seem to be working and by that Monday he went to see the eye doctor. Eye doctor said it was viral pink eye and thought it was strange that this came about right after the vaccine and in the eye on the same side he was vaccinated. Over the next days and weeks, the viral infection moved to the other eye. Both eyes stayed swollen, red and tearing constantly. He has lost some of his vision and says that things far away are very fuzzy looking. The doctor said it was the worst case of viral pink eye he has ever seen and that he would have it for the long haul of 4 to 6 weeks. He had to do a medical withdrawal from college due to missing too much of the nursing program he is enrolled in. The pinkeye is still ongoing and we don&#39;t know when it will be over.

                                                Patient had parked in the COVID vaccine waiting area, and was observed to fall forward onto his steering wheel within a few minutes of parking by 2 other participants waiting in the car next to him. One of them immediately notified one of the parking lot volunteers who came and got me within 1 minute of this observation. 2 students and I came quickly to the open drivers side door and began talking to assess the situation. Mr. Bannister appeared pale, mildly diaphoretic (sweating) and slightly confused as to the passage of time, but was able to state and spell his name and talk coherently about his circumstances. He stated that he was not allergic to anything that he knew about, and that he had no prior history of similar reactions to vaccines or medicines although he had not taken any shots in several years. He noted that he had not eaten anything since breakfast (now mid-afternoon). He described himself as initially feeling weak, faint, and nauseated with his vaccinated arm feeling heavy and numb. He also reported that he had a sensation of blurriness before passing out, but denied any spinning sensation, visual loss or ringing in the ears. There were no obviously visible abrasions or bleeding on his face or forehead. The nursing students brought a chair, and we elevated his legs and gave him some water to drink during the time we were monitoring his vital signs. He refused a cupcake because of the nausea, but as time progressed he gained facial color and was more comfortable in conversing. His hands had equal muscle grip and strength, visible fingernail beds were pink and his capillary refill was less than 3 seconds. Towards the end of our monitoring, he did accept some nuts and M &amp; Ms to eat. A University Safety Medical Report was completed by the appropriate safety personnel. He was fully AAO x 3 at the end of our monitoring, and stated that if he felt better he would drive to his apartment (less than 5 minutes away) but would wait for his girlfriend to get out of class if he did not feel fully capable of driving. We encouraged him to eat something light when he got home, to use cool water/warm water soaks at his shot site, exercise his arm, and to take an NSAID for pain relief the next day. We recommended that he eat something light before his second shot (which had already been scheduled), that he bring someone with him the next time, and as a precaution to wait 30 minutes following the second shot. He left at 3: 15 pm driving his car without any apparent difficulties. An online report was completed for the incident 04/20/2021.

He was instructed to sit and before we could help him into a chair he lost consciousness and fell. His fall was somewhat controlled by the technician. I then assessed the patient and determined he had a vasovagal episode and lifted his legs, he returned to consciousness within 10 seconds of raising his legs. I then allowed the patient to lie on the floor for approximately 20 minutes after which he felt better and returned to sitting . He then sat for about 15 more minutes until a family member was able to arrive. The patient reported no other adverse effects other than dizziness, lightheadedness, some trouble hearing and tingling fingers.

After 15 minutes after receiving vaccine, he stated he felt dizziness, warmness, and flushing. I was able to elevate his feet and provide some cold water for him. After 10 minutes, he stated he felt his airway was getting closed and tongue was getting swollen. We decided to call 911 and provided Benadryl 50mg and Epipen for him. His blood pressure was 114/90 when EMS arrived. Since his vital was normal, EMS gave options to go to emergency room or urgent care. His mom and he chose to go to urgent care since he was getting better. I was able to follow up with his mom and he is going to take Benadryl for 2 days and follow up with Additional information for Item 18: his family physician. I will follow up with his doctor as well.

                                                Pt is an otherwise healthy 20 year old male who presents with 2 weeks of blurred vision in R eye.  The blurry vision developed suddenly 1 week after getting 1st dose of covid vaccine (moderna).  He was seen in ophthalmology clinic on 04/29 and diagnosed with R optic neuritis;    The patient reports that his blurred vision has not improved or worsened since onset.  It affects both his near and far vision in the right eye only.  He denies double vision, eye pain, headaches, nausea, vomiting, numbness, tingling, or weakness.  This has never happened before.  No recent illness including fever, chills, runny nose, cough, or sore throat.  Pt admitted to hospital.   Etiology of his optic neuritis is unclear, but possibility include demyelinating etiology (like clinically isolated syndrome). Infectious etiology was thought to be unlikely given no signs/symptoms of infection and reassuring lab workup.  No family history of similar symptoms reported, making hereditary optic neuritis less likely. Other considerations included other primary ophthalmological disease, although otherwise reassuring ophthalmological exam makes that less likely. Unclear association with COVID vaccination.

I had nerve damage to my tongue from oral surgery so I dont know if its related. I started to develop vertigo today the 15th around 1pm. Vertigo has come and gone on waves. Have had a mild headache all day as well. In addition Ive had alot of trouble concentrating.

                                                * Tuesday, March 16th, I received my first Moderna shot. No immediate symptoms, felt fine. * Thursday, March 25th (9 days post-vaccination), I was sitting at my desk and experienced some kind of visual distortion (my computer monitor bounced up and down 4 times in quick succession, even though I was perfectly still). Got up from my desk and laid down, and it went away. * Tuesday, March 30th (two weeks post-vaccination), I started experiencing persistent dizziness/imbalance. It was manageable for the first couple of days, and I still went about my daily activities. * Thursday, April 1st, symptoms got noticeably worse. I had a really bad episode of vertigo/dizziness in the afternoon. This spell of bad symptoms lasted until Saturday evening/Sunday morning. I wasn?t falling down, but I would describe it as akin to being on a boat in rough seas or a plane flying through a storm. Pressure in head and ears was intense. I?ve had longstanding tinnitus, but pitch/volume definitely seemed to change somewhat. My neck was incredibly stiff, and my throat felt somewhat ?tight? (tonsils or lymph nodes in neck felt enlarged). Took ibuprofen and Benadryl on and off over next several days. * Tuesday, April 27th, symptoms are ongoing. Still having imbalance, dizziness, and non-spinning vertigo, though less severe than previously.

On May 13th around 2:40 pm, I began to experience a full sensation in my right ear. My hearing felt slightly muffled, with mild ringing. It has been 5 days since my symptoms started. On May 17th I went to my primary care provider and was told I had redness and inflammation inside my ear. I was prescribed sterile otic suspension drops of Ciprofloxacin 0.3 % and Dexamethasone 0.1% for use of 7 days. This is my second day of treatment, however I feel the same.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

Temperature gradually rose. ~99.7 at 6pm, 100.1 at 7pm, 100.7 at 8pm, 101.7 at 9:30pm. I took some Tylenol around 7pm, and then some theraflu at 10pm.   Fell asleep at 11pm. Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.   Feeling much better in the morning on March 4th. Temperature was 99.9, then rose to 100.0 at 11am. Now, at 3pm, feeling fatigue, exhaustion. No headache. Normal sense of taste and smell. No couch.  Taking another day off from work. Temperature is currently 100.0. Taking more theraflu now, have not taken Tylenol today.

After approximately 20? feet, LPN in another vaccine station down the line, noticed the patient stumbling towards the wall. She observed him stumble/fall into the wall, hitting his head, then began falling to the floor. LPN came around her partition, called for help and was immediately assisted by LPN.  The two nurses assisted the patient to the floor.  They reported his eyes were fully dilated and he began having light, full-body shakes.   The two nurses turned the patient on his side and held his head. Waters said the patient was able to answer all questions appropriately.  The full body shakes lasted approximately 30 seconds.  The Patient did not lose consciousness.  0905 Lead Nurse arrived noting the patient was lying on the floor in the prone position exhibiting mild seizure like activity and his pupils were dilated. Patient was rolled onto his side until the seizure like activity subsided, lasting for approximately 30 seconds.  0905 IC/PSC called 911, PD.   The site Medical Protocols plan was activated.       0906 Vital signs were obtained:   Blood pressure:  96/80, HR 78, 02 at 91% on room air. A neuro check was performed on the patient and he was noted to be alert and oriented x3. Patient stated he had not eaten anything prior to coming in. Patient was assisted to a seated position while still on the floor. Patient was given water, juice, a banana and other snacks.

                                                Starting about 10 hours after receiving the second Modern vaccination I experienced a minor headache and drowsiness, which continued until about 30 hours after the vaccination. These symptoms resolved without treatment. Around 20 hours after the vaccination an itchy rash developed on the lower lip, around the left eye, and in the genital area (including: penis, testicles, and upper inner thigh). Rash continued to get worse until about 4 days after the vaccination. At this point I sought treatment at a local urgent care. The urgent care personnel said they believed the rash symptoms were caused by the Modern COVID-19 vaccination, did not identify any other possible causes, and encouraged me to report it to the VAERS system. The treatment followed was topical 1% hydrocortisone cream applied to the affected areas, and 12.5 mg of diphenhydramine taken orally before bed. The rash symptoms improved with treatment but have not fully resolved at 5 days after the vaccination.

The episode lasted less than 1 minute. After this, patient was alert and oriented. Upon speaking with the patient they stated that they have this same reaction every time they give blood. They did not disclose this during the patient question or the pre-immunization interview with RPh. Patient felt hot and clammy, so we got patient an ice pack and advised they stay seated. We took patient&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate, both were normal. After monitoring patient a while longer patient stated they felt okay to leave.

I still have a loss of feeling in my feet after returning to work today, 1/25/2021, and I was promptly sent home after informing my management. I still have some loss of feeling around the corners of my mouth, and most of the feeling has recovered in my hands.

                                                I received dose #1 of COVID and planned to walk through the store to shop. While walking passed the observation chair, I began to feel dizzy and decided to sit down. After I took a seat, I immediately began to feel numbness in my arm which spread to my entire body. I was also feeling a piercing headache with ringing in my ears and my dizziness was extreme. At this point I called for help to the individual who had administered my shot as I had feared I would have fainted. I was in this extreme state for approximately 3-5 minutes. The individual at the pharmacy then checked in on me, gave me a bottle of water and after drinking it I began to feel better. I was then able to walk around and buy some food. Approximately 20 minutes after that event and eating and drinking some food, I felt like I was back to normal. I am writing this 5 hours later, and I currently feel normal, with some soreness in my arm I received the vaccine in.

                                                Pt was sitting in post-vaccination area for his 15 minute observation time when he passed out after a few minutes. He had fallen onto the floor beside his chair. I immediately went out to pt. His eyes were fluttering. I shook pt and asked if he was okay. Pt opened his eyes and sat up seemed disoriented and said that he felt nauseated. I told pt to lay down on his back and elevate his feet on the chair, and told my technician to grab a bucket, an ice pack, and to call code white. We applied the ice pack to pts head. A member of management and an EMT who happened to be in the store reported over very shortly. Pt said he did think that he hit his head and his head did hurt. We asked the pt if he wanted us to call an ambulance. Pt said no, he was feeling a little better and he just wanted to wait a little bit and then finish his shopping. Pt was feeling better and was able to get back into the chair and sit. Pt appeared pale and we got him a drink of water. Pt sat and rested for sometime and after about an hour he said he was okay and was going to finish his shopping.

Mom said patient felt better after taking Tylenol and most side effects have subsided, but she just wanted to report about side effects. Patient feels much better today (5/17/21) so mom said they are not planning to make doctor visit.

                                                Tinnitus 18 hours after second dose. Loud high pitched ringing that gets louder during quiet, when trying to sleep. Sometimes too loud to sleep. Never suffered from tinnitus in my life, musician very careful about hearing protection. Haven&#39;t seen doctor yet but I will if it doesn&#39;t go away. Reading a lot of other people have dealt with this for weeks and months after vaccination.

Severe dizziness any time I stood up. Slightly short of breath. High fever and chills.  I?ve been taking ibuprofen every few hours and drinking lots of water, and I have felt better as time has gone on. Right now I?m still slightly achy but I don?t have a fever anymore and the dizziness and chills are gone.  My appetite is starting to come back too.

The next morning I experienced a less severe headache but experienced noticeable shortness of breath especially on exertion. Tylenol P.O. helped my headache that morning, no known fever.

I was working at the time and went to my local EMS station to get checked out. They checked my blood pressure and blood sugar. Blood pressure was normal but my blood sugar was low, around 68. They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

                                                The morning after I received both vaccine shots, I posted hearing from my right ear. The first time I received the vaccine shot, the morning after, I could barely hear out of my right ear.  It almost sounded like there was a clog or earwax build-up. I didn&#39;t really think much of it and it gradually went away several days later. The worst day was the next day after the vaccine and it lasted, even though in a small amount, until 3 days after. The second dose caused the same problem. The morning after the second dose of the vaccine, I lost my hearing in the same way as before. I could barely hear out of my ear, however, I was also exhausted and ended up sleeping most of the day. When I woke up in the afternoon, I couldn&#39;t hear from my right ear, but I could hear better. (maybe 25% back to normal). The two days after the vaccine, my hearing came back way better than the previous time. It felt like 80% back to normal and later in the today, it felt like it up to 95% back to normal. The best way I can describe the feeling was as if the sound was still being received to my hear, but it sounded muffled and turned down. I was still able to hear the deeper sounds during conversations and deeper &#39;beats&#39; in music, but the sharpness of everything was turned off.

That same night I ran a fever and woke up the next morning feeling ok. I was taking a shower and it was reported to me by my fiancé I had passed out, started to seize, my eyes rolled to the back of my head. A few minutes later I woke up on the floor and asked what had happened. I was not sure what had happened.  I felt fine when I woke up. When first responders arrived they asked me if I knew who I was, the date, the president, where I lived to all I was able to answer correctly. I went to the ER and they did a ECG, blood test, urine test, chest x-ray, CT of my head and they said everything came back normal. I was prescribed Keppra and have an MRI scheduled in the coming week.

                                                Had a sore left arm where the injection site was, after about an hour later i began to have a mild headache and became tired (i took 2 aleve liquid gel pain killers and that didn&#39;t do much). The next day the pain in my arm got about 50% better, and the head ache was gone right when I woke up. I still felt tired throughout the 2nd day and my left under eye lid began to start twitching for about a minute long every 30 minutes. On the 3rd day, I was no longer tired and my arm no longer hurt but the under eye lid twitch is still occurring and at the same frequency.

                                                I had some type of allergic reaction in my eyes that caused them to burn, be sensitive to light, and felt grainy. This happened the days after getting both of my vaccines. The only thing that helped was resting my eyes but laying down caused them to burn more than compared to laying down. I could only keep my eyes open for a couple of seconds at a time but then they would start to burn. After those symptoms started to wear off, my eyes were sensitive to sunlight for more than a week.

Medics were called to see patient. Vital signs were WNL.  Once cleared by medics, patient was escorted to the ground level observation area. He soon reported that he was back to baseline. Medics cleared him as being medically stable. Patient reported that he no longer was light headed and had no visual disturbances. {Patient did say that he often gets anxious with needle injections.

Immediately after being vaccinated, I grew dizzy and felt my vision fading. I asked for some water and waited. Three minutes after vaccination, I lost consciousness and forcefully fell on the floor, scraping my head and biting the front of my tongue. I was immediately wheelchaired over to a nearby bench and tended to by a nurse and two doctors. I was sweating profusely, had a low heart rate and chills, and felt tired. After forty-five minutes, a bottle of water and a can of orange juice, I had recovered and was dismissed. I already had a ride waiting to take me home.

                                                At approximately 12:45pm on 4/27/2021, patient received his first dose of Covid19 (Moderna) vaccine, given by Pharmacist on duty. During the 15 minute observation period following the vaccine, the patient&#39;s father asked the pharmacist to check his blood pressure.  While the pharmacist was checking his blood pressure (approximately 2-3 minutes following the vaccination), she notices the patient was starting to look pale and shut and squint his eyes as if he was having trouble focusing his vision.  The pharmacist questioned the patient to make sure he felt ok, and the patient said his vision was going black and he was  getting dizzy and lightheaded.  The pharmacist moved nearby objects out of the way to prepare to lay the patient on the ground. When returning to the patient, he was staring blankly, hunched over, unresponsive, no pulse felt on a 5 second check, and had rheum dripping from nose and eyes. At 12:50pm the pharmacist instructed technician to call 911. Patient was lowered to the floor in the supine position where he remained unresponsive and no pulse could be felt on a 10 second check, but chest rise could not be evaluated as patient started to have convulsions.  Convulsions ceased after approximately 15 seconds and patient started groaning and moving his head and said he could hear but he couldn&#39;t open his eyes yet. Patient remained supine and the Pharmacist continued to carry on conversation with patient until EMS arrived at 12:57pm to evaluate patient. EMS attributed  the instance to syncope related to the vaccine.  The patient denied ambulatory care to the hospital for any further evaluation. Patient denied history of fainting expect for ?one unprovoked episode at his grandmother&#39;s house when he thinks his blood sugar got too low.?

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination the patient began to feel light headed. He stood up and fell back to the floor, landing in a sitting position and not striking his head. He was helped into a chair by a bystander and I was alerted to the situation. He appeared pale and diaphoretic, then he became unresponsive with his eyes up and his arms tensing up. After about 10 seconds he became responsive again. EMS had been called earlier and arrived a few minutes after this and he was evaluated and left with EMS. It was unclear if he had simply passed out or if he had a seizure. He had no previous history of seizure, though the presentation seemed somewhat atypical for just passing out.

                                                24 hours after the second Moderna dose, I began to feel very weak with a strong headache and a low grade fever. By Thursday (48 hours after vaccination) the headache was very strong and by that night it was debilitating. The fever had increased as well to between 101-102 degrees. Thursday night Friday I treated symptoms with alternating doses of Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, which succeeded in reducing the fever but did not rid of the headache. Saturday the debilitating headache persisted with extreme light sensitivity and nausea. The pain became so great Saturday night that my wife took me to the Emergency Room. There they performed a brain scan with an MRI that came back normal and treated the pain with Morphine. I was sent home around 8am Sunday morning with a prescription for Toradol. The pain did not decrease with the Toradol and by 6pm Sunday I was vomiting blood and the pain was excruciating. At the advice of my primary care doctor, I went back to the Emergency Room. In the Emergency department they performed a Lumbar Puncture and collected spinal fluid for testing, as well as blood for lab work. The pain was managed with Fentanyl. Late that evening the Hospital admitted me. I was given two more MRI&#39;s of the brain - one with contrast. I also underwent an upper scope of my esophagus, stomach, and upper colon which found 3 small ulcers likely due to the high volume of NSAID pain relievers taken over the previous days. The lumbar puncture revealed that my white blood cell count was 51 and they officially diagnosed aseptic meningitis.

He said throat was very dry and feeling worse. I contacted 911 and they came to the clinic to evaluate the patient. They checked blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate and rhythm. At 5:25 he decided he was feeling a little better and he refused transport by the ambulance. We arranged for an emergency contact to come pick him up.
