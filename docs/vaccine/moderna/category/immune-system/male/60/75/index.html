They gave me anti-itch stuff from the injection.  Then my Lymph nodes swelled up in my throat. I went home and took my medicine and the itching stopped in about two days.

Took Prednisone for the next 7 days with hydroxixyne which totally alleviated all symptoms. Also I went to my Primary Care MD for f/u. After treatment hives started again, then I started to take benadryl orally which kept my symptoms in check but today it came back worse again despite medication.

                                                approximately 24  hours after the injection, I had no fever, but chills, sweats and overall since of fatigue.   My resting heart rate was at 100 for a few hours.  Normally, it&#39;s around 76.    I noticed on deep breaths, I felt the need to cough (no phlegm, just a dry cough.  One or two coughs per attempt).  No medical care sought.    Those symptoms dissipated and I felt good.  Then on January 20 and 21, the chills returned.  They lasted about 8-10 hours, then they were gone.  I also developed a headache during the 20 and 21 episodes.  I checked yes in the below adverse recovery box, but I am uncertain as to what tonight and the rest of the days have in store.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

                                                Patient is meeting diagnostic criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome post-vaccination.   He received his 1st Moderna COVID vaccination on 12/31/2020 (037K20A) and his second COVID vaccination on 2/5/21 (029L20A).  He began developing high grade fevers on 1/22/21 and was admitted to our facility on 2/8/21 due to &#34;fever of unknown etiology&#34; associated with hepatitis and coagulopathy on laboratory studies.  He underwent an extensive evaluation which failed to reveal any other infectious, rheumatologic, or hematologic explanation for his clinical syndrome.  He was ultimately discharged to outpatient care with ongoing supportive care for his fevers.  His liver associated enzymes were improving at discharge.

No heart beat pulse etc... used CPR machines and paddles  Patient had walked 6 1/2 miles that morning no problems did about 50-60 miles weekly outside. This was sudden and me, his wife, say it was a reaction to something in shot that contributed to this event- there is absolutely nothing you could say to make believe differently. This happened 1 1/2 hours after getting shot.

Pain is substernal, radiated to the left arm, associated with lightheadedness.  Denies diaphoresis or nausea.  Per EMS there were short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia  3/18: - remains inpatient admission as of 3/18/21 @ 0900 63 y.o. male with a past medical history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He states he was lifting a couch yesterday and his heart started beating fast.  He did not really have any chest pain, but felt a little bit lightheaded.  He called an ambulance and they brought into the ER.  In the emergency room his EKG did show some frequent PVCs.  However, he did not really require any intervention.  He was given 3 nitro, but it really did not make any difference in the way he was feeling.  The patient denies multiple times that he actually had chest pain.  He states he just felt like his heart was beating funny.  The patient&#39;s most recent stress test was a nuclear stress test in May of 2019.  Overnight, the patient has felt very well.  He denies any significant chest pain.  He denies any further heart palpitations.  On the monitor he would occasionally going to bigeminy, which is not abnormal for him.  EKG this morning was unremarkable.   After speaking with the patient&#39;s wife, she told me that he has had a several month history of very limited exertion.  She states every time he exerts he becomes extremely dyspneic and has heart palpitations and sometimes almost passes out.  She states last night he was extremely diaphoretic and very nearly passed out.

Into the evening I started getting beyond normal reaction.  I had a very stiff shoulder joint with pain, beyond that of my existing condition.  It was severe the next day.  Saw my doctor, for the first time meet, and mentioned the reaction I got, but he said it will go away.  During the doctor visit I had elevated BP identified, which wasn&#39;t normal for me either.  That evening I had additional symptoms that included swelling at the proximal points on the thumb and index finger, this also included the wrist.  All symptoms have since subsided to normal.  No other symptoms.

                                                I am allergic to polyethylene glycol ?  it actually put me in the hospital for years ago. I had no idea it was in the vaccine, although a smaller amount than I had taken before. I started experiencing severe and awful anxiety and panic that night I got the vaccine. I had other minor side effects that were expected but they went away within a day. Several days later, I began experiencing pain in both my bilateral Achilles tendons and bilateral knee pain. A physical therapist examined both and said that I was swollen. I have had both of those problems under control for a very long time. I am improving somewhat  but nearly 2 weeks later I am still having some repercussions. I am now scared and don&#39;t know if I should get the second injection done because the previous adverse symptoms were awful. Thank you.

He has allergies to bees/egg and a h/o anaphylaxis 2/2 receiving an injection of penicillin in the past. Discussed that prior h/o anaphylaxis to PCN injection was not a contraindication to this vaccination, but is a precaution.

Pt was found to have elevated BTNP at 2240 pg/ml with fluid overload, and Biofire Respiratory Panel showed Coronavirus PCR positive.  At that time, his COVID markers were also elevated.  CRP 91.4 mg/L,  D-Dimer 2340 ng/mL.  Patient was admitted, diuresed, and started on inpatient COVID protocol which included Ivermectin.  March 9:  EKG was performed and patient was found to have a heart block.  All labs had improved over the past 48 hrs. BTNP reduced to 1530, D-Dimer reduced to  1700, CRP reduced to 47.9.   Due to the heart block, patient was transferred to a care center to a cardiologist.  Just prior to transfer, a follow up Biofire respiratory panel showed Coronavirus PCR NEGATIVE.  PCR positive and negative results were relayed to accepting facility - facility and they were going to refer to epidemiology for follow up.

                                                I suffered a heart attack on March 11, 2021, at approx 145pm, while sitting at my desk - WFH.  My symptoms were sweats, nausea, followed by chest pains beginning on the left side of my chest; sweats and nausea subsided for approx 1 hr, returning again, followed by chest pains radiating  the across the full chest approx.  I left my desk at the onset to wash my face, returning to my desk to talk a scheduled phone call at 2pm, lasting until 3pm.  I left desk to walk outside to take in some fresh air, my wife ask me if I was ok, I said no.  She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.  Shortly thereafter I was taking to the Cath lab where a stent was insert and then taken to ICU.  Where I remained until I was released on 3/12/2021 at 3pm.  There was no detectable heart damage and I was placed a regime of blood thinner, a beta blocker and cholesterol med.  I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or history of heart problems.  My last physical was Feb 2021.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, no problems until I woke up in the middle of the night, and I was sore and my arm was hurting and I was sweating. I started having chills. I have a fever, still with aches and pains. The soreness at the injection site is about gone. Yesterday, 01.03.21, I was running a fever between 99-101 all night long. Last night I took one Tylenol to help slow it down a little. It&#39;s been pretty severe up until now. Right now my temp is 98.1.  I did not go to the ER and my wife has the lot number in her purse with her right now.

This violent shaking happened throughout the night and well into the next morning, when it began to taper off - no elevated temperature occurred, although there was a slight headache and significant fatigue with some mental fog.  I took a single dose of Tylenol

                                                Ongoing issues with migrating joint and muscle aches. Initially I took  advil. After 2 weeks my GP prescribed a medrol dose pak that got rid of symptoms immediately and for the duration of the treatment. When the meds were over the symptoms came back to a lesser degree. The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

HCP approached vehicle where a 68yo white male was sitting in his vehicle on the driver side. Quick assessment revealed erythema of the face and angioedema. Pt was able to speak clearly, was CTA and had RRR. 911 was called. BP 160/90.  EpiPen dose 1 was injected into right vastus lateralis and pt reported improvement at 1057.  HCP asked for injectable diphenhydramine. HCP continued to monitor pt with RRR and CTA but erythema and angioedema began again along with swollen tongue so EpiPen dose 2 was injected into right vastus lateralis. 50mg IM diphenhydramine was injected into the right deltoid while fire rescue began to arrive on scene. Pt did not report difficulty breathing. Pt did report previous anaphylaxis to fire ant bites/stings and did report being allergic to bee stings. Fire rescue transported patient without difficulty. HCP called pt later that night at 2030 who reported doing better but still having tongue swelling.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                Possible MSG reaction, probably aggravated after vaccination.   Had meal approx. 1 hour before vaccination.   After vaccination (roughly 45 minutes), felt &#34;foggy&#34; feeling, akin to being drunk.   After looking for possible links to vaccine, and given that the reaction seemed like a strong reaction previously attributed to  MSG, searched the ingredients listed by the caterer and found that a side dish listed MSG.   ~~  Drove home without incident.  &#34;Foggy&#34; feeling dissipated after a few hours.   No significant reaction to the vaccine itself except slightly sore arm.

At on or around 8:45 PM my dad called my sister that he was having trouble breathing and felt very short of breath. My sister was there in about 7min by the time she got to him my dad was gasping for air he would lift his head up trying to breath. They got him to the hospital shorty after about a 7 min drive. My dad was taken into hospital we were not able to go in due to restrictions.

He couldnt put words together to make a sentence.  He got up to go into the kitchen and then urinated all over himself.  He was worried about falling sleep, scared he would die in his sleep.  The 3rd woke up and was feeling some better but still foggy headed.  Pt went to the ER about 5 days later.  They did a CT and blood work.  He thinks the tests results came back negative. They wanted him to stay longer and maybe see a Neurologist but since there wasnt one available to see at that time the pt decided to go home.  He has blood work and urine labs to be done at the facility on 2/23/2021.  Pt states he is feeling better at this time.

Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

I rushed him to the emergency hospital they ran cat scans, MRI, heart tests etc. He stayed overnight while they checked. The next day we went to eye doctor who told him he had a eye stroke. He would regain some of his site not all of it. Something to do with blood clot or loss of blood to the eye. I was not satisfied with that so made another drs appointment for the next day with a different eye doctor. The first eye doctor gave us some blood test to do so we did it then. Later that evening we got an emergency call form the first eye doctor to get back to the hospital right away he could lose sight in the other eye.. They found some high c-reactive protein. Normal is 8 his was over 40. They put him on heavy steroids and did biopsy on both temples of his eyes. This started last Wednesday morning. He was released from the hospital Monday Morning to see his regular doctor that afternoon. Test results for the eye would be Tuesday and all other vital tests came back fine thank goodness. On Tuesday the biopsy tests also came back negative so they are stopping steroids. I think they were looking for auto immune issues. Today we are going to Rheumatologist

After a couple of days my mouth improved. My mouth was almost well by Feb16. On Feb 10 I received the Moderna covid boster vaccine.  On Feb 17 my mouth again became numb and swollen. As of this date 2/22/2021 my mouth is again improving and is nearly well. I visited my Primary Care Doctor on Feb 19, 2021. We decided to wait and see if this gets better on its own. If not I will see an Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist.

                                                Second day (Tuesday 1/5/21) swelling and some soreness on inside of throat right side. Wednesday 1/6/21 swelling had spread significantly to inside the right side of mouth and tongue also affecting right jaw. By 3 Pm that day my tongue was numb and swollen on the right side as well as the right side of my mouth and jaw. I could only chew, eat, and swallow effectively on the left side of my mouth using the left side of my tongue to negotiate eating.  I could only this with small amounts of food. By that evening about 4 hours later I could eat , chew etc. pretty good but the swelling &amp; discomfort remained but reduced to a functional level.  Today, Thursday 1/7/21, the soreness and discomfort remains inside throat, mouth, tongue and jaw all on the right side.

No muscle ache. After vaccination I lifted weights, stretched arm and took very cold and very warm showers on the area. My theory was dispurse the concentration to avoid the muscle ache. Maybe so.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

                                                This gentleman was hospitalized with dyspnea, found to have a leukocytosis and probable right lower lobe pneumonia, hospitalized for IV antibiotic therapy.  He is still hospitalized but improving as of the date of this report. His COVID-19 test was negative on the day of admission. He had no symptoms out of the ordinary on the day of his vaccination. I am reporting this as it occurred in the week after his first dose of vaccine though would suspect the timing is likely coincidental rather than directly related to the vaccine.

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

                                                On March 4 patient experienced vomiting. Early morning March 5 he fell and landed on his hip after being disoriented and experienced aches, weakness, and nausea without vomiting throughout the day. On March 6 he experienced excruciating pain in his left hip and went to the local emergency room following guidance from his primary care physician. He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker. On March 12 he received a cortisone shot and required emergency medical assistance to get into a personal vehicle with a family member who drove to the appointment. The next few days, the pain persisted, became worse, and spread throughout his body. On March 16 he was transported by emergency medical services to the local emergency room for treatment and was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia. On March 18 he was still being treated when he experienced cardiac arrest while being intubated. He was resuscitated and was on a ventilator being treated for a few more days but ultimately succumbed to sepsis on March 30.
