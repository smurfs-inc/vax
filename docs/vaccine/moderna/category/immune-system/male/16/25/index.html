                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the first dose of my vaccine at about 8:30am on January 12. Around 6pm on January 12 I started to experience chills. As the night went on the chills got worse and I developed a terrible throbbing headache. In addition to that I was feeling hot and sweating profusely. I fell asleep around 10pm and woke up around 11pm, at this time the headache was worse, the chills were getting better, and I was still hot and drenched in sweat. I was able to fall back to sleep shortly after. I then woke up at 1am on the 13th, I still had a headache, the chills were gone, I was still hot and sweaty. At this time I also started vomiting. I preceded to vomit until there was nothing left in me and went back to bed. I woke up at 3am and proceeded to dry heave as there was nothing left to come up. My headache was extremely bad at this point and I was still hot and sweaty. I could not keep down Tylenol so I used a cold wet rag to help with the headache. I was finally able to sleep again. I woke up at 5am still with a headache and still hot at this time I was able to take my temperature and it was 99.8. I fell asleep again and woke up at 9am with a temperature of 100.1, at this time I was able to take Tylenol and keep it down which broke my fever and alleviated the headache. Now at about 1pm on the 13th I am still only able to sip liquids and my stomach is upset. This was the sickest I have been in a long time. I have spoken on the phone with a triage nurse at my doctors office and I am waiting for her to consult with a doctor and call me back.

Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

The story sounds c/w localized vaccine reaction, but the area is indurated/warm, so just in case of cellulitis I plan to treat w/ keflex. I do think there is an inflammatory/allergic component, so I also prescribed topical hydrocortisone for itching. Discussed plan/SRP w/ pt in detail. Answered all questions. Pt verbalized understanding, agreed to plan/SRP, and pt was d/c&#39;ed in stable condition.

By the way I had Mono 13 months ago that was pretty bad and had COVID in November not that severe at all.

                                                I received the vaccine through my employer.  7 Days after the vaccination event, my left deltoid muscle became significantly swollen, stiff and tender. There was pain when I tried to elevate the arm laterally. The site was very warm to the touch. I experienced periods of malaise and fatigue at random intervals throughout the week after which I received the vaccine. On day 8, a red rash began to appear on the vaccination site. It was slightly itchy. The area was still stiff and swollen, and painful to move past a certain angle. This night I felt especially fatigued. On day 9 I woke up to see the swelling was mostly subsided, however the rash had spread down the arm to roughly the elbow. The site was no longer warm. It was still slightly irritable. As the day is progressing (this is written on day 9), the rash is starting to fade.

At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

The pain proceeded to worsen over the next week and moderate lymphadenopathy was also been noted. These lymph nodes are tender to palpation. Additionally some Parasthesias were felt down the left forearm into the hand possibly due to brachial neuritis or nerve pressure due to lymphadenopathy.   The parasthesias lasted approximately 2 days.  Lymphadenopathy is now present in the right axilla along with more severe adenopathy in the left axilla.  - PA-S2

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?

Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.
