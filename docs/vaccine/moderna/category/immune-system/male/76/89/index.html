Presented to ED with newly diagnosed AML, in MDS with WBC counts ~250, 000.    He had a normal (EX ANEMIA) CBC on Jan-21. He had COVID vaccine #1 on Jan-25.  About 4-days later he developed diffuse dermititis and severe fatigue. He had an  ED visit on Feb-8 for these issues and was prescribed Prednisone and Cefalexin  (completed Feb-15).  CBC was NOT done at that ED visit. He called HEME clininc  on Feb-16 (see also the Hematology Note) stating that he was just NOT feeling  well in general with increased fatigue and DOE. He noted that the dermatitis was  mostly resolved. We rechecked CBC on Feb-17 (results available about 4-PM) that  indicated ACUTE LEUKEMIA.  Presents to the MC with MDS on FEB18.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.   On 15JAN2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly (Lot number: 026L20A). On 16JAN2021, the patient noted a start date for Pneumonia.  On 10FEB2021, the patient called the medical information call center and reported, &#34;he is on antibiotics for pneumonia. His 2nd question is can he delay the 2nd dose since he is suffering from pneumonia. Patient was administered 1st dose of vaccine on 15/Jan/2021 in his left non dominant arm. The lot# was provided, but expiration date is unknown. Patient experienced some expected side effects, which he is not concerned about&#34;.  The event(s) were arm swollen, tired, achy, lingering shortness of breath, muscle weakness in the injection arm, and tested positive for pneumonia 1 day after receiving the vaccine.  The action taken for Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) Vaccine was reported by the patient as Tylenol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the events of fatigue, arm swelling, myalgia, muscle weakness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the event of Pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related. Further information has been requested.

                                                cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient received dose 2 series of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. First dose was received on 1/17/21 and second dose received 2/14/21. After both doses patient was observed for 15 minutes and did not have any adverse reaction per administering RN. No data in database or database as to any other adverse events occurring 15 minutes post-vaccination. On 3/20/21, EMS was called to patient&#39;s home who was discovered on the floor with an unknown breathing status and pulse. AED was attached to the patient. A very weak pulse was found and patient had agonal respirations. Cardiac monitor was attached to patient with a HR of 32. 1mg of atropine was administered and patient&#39;s rhythm changed to PEA with no respirations or pulse. Per patient&#39;s wife and son, he was a DNR, therefore all resuscitation attempts were stopped (patient was never admitted to the hospital). Patient was never known to be previously positive to COVID. PMH that may have predisposed patient to this adverse event leading to death include h/o DVT on chronic anticoagulation, COPD, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is insufficient information to determine the exact cause of death or what led to the cardiac arrest given that the time from last vaccination to the adverse event was almost a month apart.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

But then a fever, chills and aches the day after vaccine. Two days after, still febrile and feeling worse and experiencing shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Fatigue, fever and lightheadedness continue for three more days. On the 6th day post-vaccine, taken to ER and admitted to hospital with a pneumonia and blood counts dangerously low. Received 3 blood transfusions and is receiving 2 different IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Still in hospital and waiting to see how blood counts go. I can?t say the vaccine CAUSED this, but it all happened rapidly, immediately following the vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

                                                UTI; Anemia; Colitis; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 77 years-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who developed anemia, colitis and Urinary Tract Infection (UTI).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 039k208) on 29 Dec 2020. On 26 Jan 2021, approximately 6 days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 019K20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01 Feb 2021, the patient had a hospital visit for anemia and colitis for which patient was admitted and was discharged on 04 Feb 2021.The patient was again admitted to the hospital on 22 Feb 2021, for UTI and was at the hospital at the time of reporting.   Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information has been provided for this cases Although, a temporal association exist between the product use and the reported events of anemia and colitis, critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medication list lacking.  Urinary tract infection is of an infective etiology as  such a causal relationship is unlikely.

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

                                                At 5:00 AM Sunday morning, extreme pain, achy all over, headache, aching all the way down legs, back, neck.  Almost like having the COVID virus.  Rolled out of bed, could not stand up or hardly walk to the bathroom.  Felt very faint, had to hold onto wall.  Was very sweaty, running temperature, cold sweats.  Just kept getting worse and thought about going to the ER and then decided to put it off until talking to somebody.  Called 2-1-1 and the lady told her that it was part of the side-effects to it.  She told her to call her doctor, and they were not in on the weekend.  This morning, the doctor called and asked if she had Corona, his other doctor retired and got this one the first of January.  Took 3 months to recover from the COVID and was on antibiotics, and told her because he have antibodies.  Feeling better, still having some achiness.

                                                Currently waiting for dental work (crown removal and replacement to treat cavity).    2/18/21 Started to experience toothache (R) which got worse as the day progressed.  Tylenol didn&#39;t help.  Took one tab of Percocet (5-325) to allow me to sleep.    2/19/21 Contacted dentist and was prescribed Penicillin VK 500 mg. Started Penicillin around 3 pm.   2/19/21 ~6 pm onset shakes, chills, sweating, low grade fever (~100.2), nausea, headache, weakness,  difficulty in standing.  Took more tylenol, lay down, fell asleep for approximately 3 hours. Woke briefly took my nighttime meds (atrovastatin, metoprolol, ranolazine, baby aspirin.) Additional information for Item 18:  2/20/21 Felt better when I woke up.  Temp normal. Ate breakfast.  Mild stomach ache. Around 3 pm onset of sweating and chills, shakes. Low grade temp (~100)   2/22/21 Fully recovered.  No lingering issues.  Not sure whether what I experienced is related to the Moderna vaccine or a reaction to the Percocet I took to alleviate the severe pain associated with my toothache.

From ER MDs note: EKG was normal sinus rhythm, narrow QRS, delayed transition, minimal lateral st depression V4. Patient IV access on arrival, would Brady down to the 40s 1 time as low as 27 but remained alert, blood pressure is not dip.  Troponin was mildly elevated and decision was made to transfer the patient.  Prior to transfer is necessary to rule out pulmonary embolism, intracranial injury Patient wished to proceed with CT angio chest and noncontrast CT of head which were without acute findings.  Patient given aspirin 81 mg to supplement the 81 mg he had earlier today.  Discussed with hospitalist, patient was accepted in transfer. Suspect this is combination of patient&#39;s beta blockade with underlying sinus node dysfunction.  Patient does have prominent lower extremity swelling and suspect pulmonary hypertension despite treatment with CPAP but cannot exclude valvular heart disease.  Patient was went to Hospital.  Symptoms thought to be unlikely from seizure.  Doubt CVA, ongoing cardiac ischemia.

He was initially tachycardic, febrile and had leukocytosis 18K, with admission labs with creatinine 1.8, lactate 2.4. He had need for supplemental oxygen and was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Respiratory viral panel including SARS COV2 PCR was neg. Blood cultures from 2/24, 2/27, 3/3 were negative. CT chest showed some prominent mediastinal adenopathy which was increased from prior CT 2017. Also had axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2/27 he had a code blue called for bradycardia in context of receiving ativan for a CT study. Antibiotics  were changed to Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, acyclovir on 2/28. Multiple attempts by multiple providers at doing a lumbar puncture have been unsuccessful.  Bronchoscopy 3/2 with left lower lobe secretions. Cultures negative. He has stayed incessantly febrile and working diagnosis is probable underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm immunostimulated by vaccine. At this time a bone marrow and lymph node excisional biopsy is planned. Patient is unstable to proceed for MRI imaging at this time due to hypotension.

                                                Around 4:30am on the day after administration of the vaccination, patient went into ventricular tachycardia and his ICD attempted anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). Per electrophysiology note after interrogation of patient&#39;s ICD: &#34;Multiple VT episodes beginning around 4:30 AM, and continuing intermittently through 10:15 AM, approximately. There were 19 treated VT episodes, mostly terminated with ATP therapy. There was a single 24J shock delivered at 9:43 AM after a VT episode lasting 1 min, 4 seconds, with average ventricular rate 171 bpm. This appeared to be an appropriate shock after exhausting 8 ATP attempts. On 5 other occasions the patient required 4 or more ATP sequences to terminate VT. The remainder terminated with 1-2 ATPs. Reviewing the far field electrograms, there appear to be 2 distinct VT morphologies. Average ventricular rates for both are about 170-180 bpm.&#34;  Patient presented to the emergency room, where he received amiodarone IV, and was admitted to an inpatient cardiology service. He was restarted on amiodarone and was noted to be hemodynamically stable and not in VT; however, he opted to leave the hospital AMA on 3/15. As noted previously (item 11), he has a history of VT and had discontinued amiodarone due to side effects about 6 weeks prior to this episode. As amiodarone has a half-life of around 45 days, it is thought that his rhythm control was suboptimal at the time of this vaccination, and there is no evidence that it was the vaccination that caused the VT episodes on 3/14.

                                                On 02/17/2021, patient received the second dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine in the left arm. Approximately 3 days post-administration, patient developed pain, swelling and erythema of the shoulder extending to the posterior/proximal anterior sections of the arm. Patient was unable to move arm due to swelling and presented to the Medical Center Emergency Department on 02/22/2021. A CT of the extremities revealed cellulitis, myositis, and possible fasciitis without abscesses. Subsequent MRI found myositis and cellulitis without evidence of osteomyelitis. Patient began to develop erthematous blotches and an Infectious disease consult was placed. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin). After cultures were obtained, patient was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. Two sets of blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics and a left arm swab showed no growth (finalized). On 02/26/2021 patient underwent incision and debridement of left arm with findings of edematous soft tissue without abscess or necrosis. On 02/28/2021 all antibiotics were discontinued per Infectious Disease provider due to lack of concern for infection.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

On 11 Feb 2021, in the morning, patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273(BATCH/LOT # 007M20A) probably in the right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, approximately after 15 minutes of receiving vaccine, they left and patient was immediately very tired, his hands were shaking. So, patient&#39;s spouse made them down sleep for too long. On Friday, 12 Feb 2021 she tried to pick him up, but he was tired, exhausted, and sick.   On Saturday, 13 Feb 2021, she brought him a coffee and he couldn&#39;t hold it because his hands were shaking, so she gave him the coffee and then made him pee on the bed because he couldn&#39;t get up. At lunch time she made him eat something and he fell sleep again. His wife was hanging around him all day and around 7:30pm she realized that he was cold, and his neck was sweating, she couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat. So, she called emergency services and when they arrived, her husband&#39;s blood pressure went down until he died. Treatment for the events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  Patient was pronounced dead on 13 Feb 2021 20:00. The cause of death was not provided. The plans for an autopsy were not provided.

                                                The day following vaccination, 12/31/2020 at 1230, the patient had an acute onset of shortness of breath, tachypnea (rate 34)wheezing, tachycardia (rate 130s and irregular), oxygen desaturation (89 to 91% on room air), and clear rhinorrhea, non-productive cough. Earlier in the day he complained of not feeling well, but non-specific.  He was assessed and given an albuterol nebulizer treatment. In the coming hour, his wheezing resolved, work of breathing improved, heart rate and respirations decreased. He was ambulating around without signs of activity intolerance. It was felt that he was stable and back to baseline, so he was monitored by the nursing staff. A chest x-ray was ordered but not completed.  On 1/1/2021 at approximately 0925, a nursing assistant described loss of consciousness for 20-25 seconds. It appeared that he was not breathing, slumped over in the chair at the breakfast table eating cream of wheat, eyes rolled back in his head. He regained consciousness, breathing normally after coughing. He did not appear to be choking. His heart rate was recorded as irregular, rate 32 by the nursing staff. He was transported to the Emergency Department at Hospital for evaluation. No concerning findings.

Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.

                                                My grandpa got his second covid vaccine on Thursday. Saturday he complained of stiff neck.

                                                UTI; weakness; neck pain; A spontaneous report was received  from a healthcare professional concerning an 85-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced UTI (urinary tract infection), weakness (asthenia) and neck pain.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 26-Jan-2021, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT/BATCH: 029K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and was admitted for two days for UTI, weakness, and neck pain. Treatment for the events was not reported.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome of the events, UTI, weakness and neck pain, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I did have and still have soreness of shoulder where I got the injection. That I can expect to stay. When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.

Daughter was home with pt and after he went to the bathroom she reports pt was out of breath, however that has been chronic/ongoing for him due to his diagnosis of COPD, pulmonary HTN and metastatic lung cancer. After sitting and resting in a chair, she states patient became unresponsive. She called 911 who told her he had no pulse and was not breathing. She states that they were not able to resuscitate him. Pt had been suspected to be positive for COVID as he had symptoms of increased cough, congestion and rhinitis. Daughter (that is primary caregiver and lives in home with patient) tested positive for COVID on 1/31/21. She started having symptoms on 1/25/21. Patient started having symptoms on 1/31/21.
