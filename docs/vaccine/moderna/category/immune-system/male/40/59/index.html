Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

He pulled over and threw up. Once he got to work he vomited again. He drove to another facility for work and then threw up 3 or 4 more times. He began experiencing hot flashes at this time. He went to the hospital and was seen in the emergency room. He threw up several more times in the ER and stated that his heart was racing and that he had diarrhea. The emergency room gave him medications for the nausea and he stayed there for 2 or 3 hours. He began to feel better and was discharged to home.

                                                Around noon, my fiance doubled over in agonising pain and clutched his right side. We treated it like a stomach ache and he went through the rest of the day, even at work, in gut wrenching pain. This morning when I woke up, I noticed he was out on the couch. When I went to check on him, he was as white as a ghost and his lips were greying around the edges. I immediately told him to call into work. I thought he would say no because he has not called in in over 10 years, but to my surprise, he did so. I put him in bed and the abdominal pain is still present and now his fever is over 103!!!  I bought Tylenol and Motrin and will be alternating between the two until the fever breaks and if the pain persists by 8 pm, we will be headed to the emergency room...

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

Then one week later on 1/26/2021 I started having vaccine shoulder itchiness I didn&#39;t think anything of it and then my arm swelled and got hot. The next day on 1/27/2021 it had a red area around it and was hot. I have never had a fever or anything else except minor pain the day after the vaccine.  I continued ibuprofen and benadryl at night it took the itch away and was bearable. I want to know if I should get the second shot? I have it scheduled for 2-15-2021 @ 2:00 pm PST I also have pictures

Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

                                                3-5 hrs s/p vaccine- soreness at injection site. About 12h s/p vaccine administered (around 9p) began to experience chills, headache, fatigue.  This persists/worsens accompanied by chills. Temp taken at 10p (99.1, my normal is 97.6) By 0150, temp up to 100.4 along with continuing alternating sweats/chills and persisting headache. 1000mg Tylenol used at 0150.  At 0240, symptoms settle a bit and got a little sleep. 0445, woke up- headache persists. Mild chills/sweats. Afebrile at 98.6. Still fatigued. At 0800 on 1/5/21, another 1000mg Tylenol used as aforementioned symptoms worsening.  Now at 1035 (time of this report), chills/sweats have settled - left with fatigue, headache, and nasal congestion.    Of note, I tested positive for COVID and was sick for about 2-3 weeks in Sep 2020.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

His Apple Watch told him he was in afib.  So the patient was taken to the ER by his wife where this was confirmed with an EKG.  He was cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm and he was prescribed Eliquis.  Patient has no prior heart arrhythmias or medical concerns.  Patient is slightly overweight, but has not had any arrhythmia or history of a fib in the past.  Patient was discharged to follow up with his family physician.  All of his blood work was normal.

Symptoms after 2nd shot01/19/2021 - slight fatigue recovered after 24 hours.  4 days after 2nd shot - Developed cold sore on lower lip area. To my recollection, I have never had a cold sore before which is a bit concerning. I understand that I may contracted HSV-1 and not have know it as child. I am curious if somehow the COVID vaccine somehow compromised immune system to a degree that the HSV-1 is now active? May very well not classify as an &#34;adverse event,&#34; but since I haven&#39;t heard of any such issues I thought I should report.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

I began to sweat a little and have minor tachycardia.  I never went back into the clinic but instead leaned the seat of my car back and those symptoms went away after about 30 minutes.  I never experienced any symptoms after that.

                                                An hour or so after receiving my first Moderna shot, I was aware of an unusual feeling in my lower right abdomen.  Knowing this to be a potential problem area for Appendicitis I paid attention to it for the next day and there was no change.  Two days after receiving the  vaccine shot this sensation got worse and I was visibly bloated.  I went to an Urgent Care where a doctor referred me to the closest ER due to the area of pain and bloat in my body.   After several blood tests and an MRI at the ER, it was determined that my appendix was inflamed and I was admitted to the hospital for surgery ASAP.   Luckily the appendix was stable, never burst and was successfully removed the following day in the early afternoon.   I am currently at home recovering successfully.

                                                I became very clammy in the hands and started to black out just 10 minutes after having the vaccination shot.  I was in the waiting room.  The staff member monitoring saw me going to the floor and called the head doctor over to help.  They called EMT&#39;s.  I was laid onto the floor on my back and legs up onto a chair.  The staff took my blood pressure which was low.  Approximately, 2 minutes later, they took my blood pressure and it went back up to a more normal level.  The EMT&#39;s helped me up and took my blood sugar levels and pulse oxygen levels which seemed normal.  I was able to feel better, but the color of my skin was yellowish and pale.  The EMT&#39;s suggested that I talk with my doctor before getting another vaccine and talk about my symptoms.

                                                Vaccine was administered to patient in his room at 12:50pm.  After the patient finished his lunch in his room he was wheeled out to the nursing station for observation.  at 1:30pm the nurse wheeled patient into our working/set up area and stated that patient is having a vaccine reaction.  I observed that his lips were noticeably swollen.  I asked patient to stick out his tongue, it also was noticeably swollen.  Only the tip of his tongue extended about 1/2 inch past his lips.  I administered 0.3mg of Epinephrine via and epi-pen into his right thigh and instructed the nursing staff to call 911.  Patient improved markedly over the next 10 minutes when Fire Department EMT&#39;s arrived.  Nursing staff monitored his  blood pressure, heart rate and pulse  and oxygen sat.  heart rate was elevated somewhat likely due to epi , BP was 121/73, pulse steady and ox sat good.  Fire Department transported patient to a nearby ER for further evaluation and treatment if necessary.

                                                I didn&#39;t have any adverse affects until 5 days after I received the vaccination. Early in the afternoon on Wednesday 1/20 I noticed that my lymph nodes in the armpit of my left arm and on the left side of my neck were swollen and sore. This worsened as the day went on. I also noticed a pimple had formed and came to a head in the exact spot of where the needle stick had been. It &#34;popped&#34; that day and a small amount material came out. My lymph nodes have remained sore and swollen since 1/20. On the 7th day after (1/22) I noticed a couple of smaller, dime sized red blotches/rash on my left shoulder and left side of my neck. I also noticed that the injection site on my left shoulder was sore, swollen and hot to touch. On the 8th day (1/23) I noticed that there were more of these dime sized red blotches/rash across both shoulders, my back and a small area in the center of my chest.  It continues to be like that as of today (1/25). On the 9th day, (1/24) starting just after noon, I began to feel poorly. Achy and just generally not very good. I had a few bouts of diarrhea throughout the afternoon. I also had a pretty strong headache when I awoke on the morning of the 24th. Today, (1/25) I awoke again with a headache although it was not as sore as yesterday. I don&#39;t feel great today, but I do feel better than I did yesterday. The rash looks the same and my lymph nodes seem to be slightly less swollen and less sore.

                                                2-3 min after vaccination he started feeling tingling in the right side of his face. About one minute later he felt like he could not get a full breath and he felt the need to run away. We connected a heart monitor, did serial vital signs, listen to lung sounds. He symptoms seem to worsen. He did not have hives, his lungs were clear. His HR was normal but his B/P was elevated. We started and IV and gave him 25 mg mg of IV Benadryl. We contacted Dr. via phone. He talked to the patient and he agreed with our assessment and treatment.  He began feeling better about 10 min after the Benadryl and he symptoms cleared by 30 min after Benadryl. We kept him on the heart monitor for 1 hour.  He reported he felt fine and back to normal when he left to go home. He refused ambulance transport to the hospital. All reports will be filled out by me.

Got epi 0.3 mg IM, Decadron 10 mg IV, Zyrtec 10 mg, Pepcid 40 mg po, Benadryl 25 mg po, with improvement.  Allergy consulted, felt this was likely delayed hypersensitivity reaction to Moderna, but couldn&#39;t exclude lisinopril side effect.  They recommended Zyrtec 10 mg bid for 1 wk, and stay off lisinopril.  Will follow up in Clinic to determine how to approach 2nd shot.

                                                Patient got his Covid vaccine this past Thursday, 2 days ago.  He experienced typical side effects of a sore left shoulder and some fatigue but was feeling well until this afternoon around 1:55 PM when he noticed throbbing of his left hand.  He looked down and noticed that there was a purple discoloration to his middle finger and distal palmar aspect of his hand.  He felt like there was maybe some swelling as well and that he might have been having an allergic reaction so called the emergency department for further advice and came in for evaluation.  By the time I arrived to the emergency department the patient&#39;s left hand was no longer swollen and there was only a small purple discoloration to the palmar proximal middle finger.  I was concerned that the patient developed a small blood clot that was resolved upon evaluation.

The morning of January 12, 2021 I woke with severe muscle and joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue.  As the day progressed I developed chills to the point I could not get warm.  I also developed a low grade fever.  After taking two ibuprofen around 3p the pain subsided to an ache about my entire body by 9p, headache had subsided and I had no more chills or fever.  On the morning of January 13, 2021 I woke with a red rash going up the inside of both arms and around the outside of my upper arms and down my entire back.  As the day has progressed that rash has spread down the back of legs as well.  I did take one Benadryl with minimal effect.

As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccination, I started to have severe chills, fever, intense headache, body aches, inability to sleep and sweating.  This last 24 hours and then began to dissipate.  The headache left first.  These symptoms mirrored the symptoms I had with COVID minus the sinus drainage and sore throat I had with COVID.  Yet, the symptoms were more intense.  The reaction to the vaccine was the sickest I recall being in the last 20 years.  It was a long 24 hours. I went to the ER and obtained a liter of fluids via IV and motrin type medicine.  I was advised it should last about 24-36 hours and discharged.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

                                                I experienced insidous onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations after approximately 2-3 minutes of inoculation.  This episode lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I was not expecting this having no prior history of adverse response to vaccines.  I also felt a flushing sensation in my head.   My breathing felt slightly more difficult.  No sweating, throat closure or itching.   I did not measure pulse and instead tried to breathe/meditate to bring it down.  I estimate it was about 140 bpm .  Breathing/meditation brought it down but it was still elevated when the nurse checked me after 20 minutes.  I remained onsite an additional 15 minutes until I felt well enough to leave but my heart rate was still somewhat elevated, about 20 bpm higher than my usual.   My heart rate seemed to fluctuate throughout the evening and my sleep was subsequently very poor.  I feel much better this morning, just the usual arm soreness after a vaccination.  I have reached out to my primary doctor concerning whether she feels this event would warrant my not getting the second dose or perhaps having a prescribed epipen on my person.  Having no personal history but a family history of severe heart disease (father had first MI at age 42, second at 44 followed by triple bypass and CHF) this incident with my heart rate certainly raised some anxiety.  I had a routine EKG done in June which was normal, I am a physical therapist and in good health.  I am hoping to have the next vaccine in a proper medical facility.   I have read CDC recommendations to not have the second shot if certain adverse responses are experienced and I am not certain whether this would qualify.   I have no history of adverse reactions to vaccines.    Considering the role of anxiety versus the insidious and nearly immediate onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations and persistent elevated heart rate for more than 12 hours, I feel this event was primarily driven by the vaccine.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

Was not immediately noticeable and seemed to be more pronounced about 1/2 hour after injection.  I had the other expected soreness at injection site and general malaise approximately 24 hours after  - 96 hours after vaccine and I am only reporting this as I was not expecting the numbness in the tongue and was not sure if it was an adverse effect or just stress related.

This subsided and then on day 3 he developed severe substernal chest pain and came to ER where his hs-cTnI was &gt; 2000 ng/L and peaked at 6700 ng/L.  His ECG, echo and cardiac cath were normal but MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular dysfunction. He is doing well clinically and we are managing expectantly.

                                                22 hours after receiving the vaccine, I had  fever and the chills.  This was followed by a headache.  This was not unexpected.  I fell into a deep sleep that lasted 2 hours.  I awoke suddenly with a very bad headache.  I drank about 3 ounces of orange juice and then took 30 ml of pharmacy brand liquid Tylenol.  This is the bad symptom that I want to report.  As soon as the liquid Tylenol hit the back of my throat it felt as if my throat constricted tightly.  I immediately stopped drinking it and was able to spit out some of what was in my mouth.  I was unable to get air in or out.  I stood up  and eventually was able to get a big gulp of air into my lungs before everything closed up again.  Eventually I was able to get another gulp of air in and I began to cough a little.  Once I drank some water, I could feel the liquid Tylenol on the back of my throat get washed down  and I was able to breath normally in about 2 minutes.   The cup of liquid Tylenol still had about 20 ml of fluid in it and I spit out perhaps half of what entered my mouth; I&#39;m estimating that 5 ml of liquid Tylenol went down  my throat.  Note that this is not a case of the liquid Tylenol going down my windpipe by mistake.  I know what that feels like and it is different.  It was all very traumatic.

                                                About an hour after being vaccinated, I got very pale, and almost had a syncope episode at work.  I felt weak kneed for about 2 hours afterwards, and was still wobbly knees the next day.   I also had muscle/joint aches the same day, which went away within 24 hours.  In the past 6 days, I have had reoccurring headaches, fatigue, and  this morning, had a severe enough headache to bring on nausea.   I am med compliant with all my meds and I take care of my Type II diabetes,    I am also a volunteer firefighter - advanced EMT, so I know when there is a problem.

                                                Initially there was soreness at injection site which lasted about a week, lessening with each day. I was incredibly fatigued for about three days after. Also, the entire right forearm felt sore for about a week, as well. The day after vaccine shot, my right testes was achey and sore (and still is uncomfortable) Also, the top side of my right foot was very tender. During the course of the week, that part of my foot became lightly swollen as did the front of my right leg, up to the top of the shin bone. Today?s date: 1/22/21 5:19 pm and leg and foot still tender and slightly swollen.

We instructed him to take off his jacket and gave him a cool rag. After the 15 minutes of observation were up, he felt good. He denied any s/s of dizziness or light-headiness or shortness of breath. I called to check on him today and he reported that he feels a little tired and has some nausea at times. His arm is a little sore, but he is doing ok.

He stated that he had a history of hypoglycemia as well but had not had issues with it in a while.  Patient reported that his BG had been 80 that morning and that he had eaten Chick Fil a prior to coming for the vaccine.  We offered a snack or glucose tablet but patient refused.  We did recommend that the patient remain in our observation are a for an extra 15 minutes and he agreed.  After monitoring and water the patient felt better and purchased glucose tablets when he left.

                                                At 5 days post vaccination, patient developed severe left shoulder pain, originally thought to be secondary to chronic shoulder pain and a recent fall, over the next three days it progressed to swelling, severe pain, and limited ROM. He ended up being admitted to the hospital and CT scan showed development of significant soft tissue infiltration around sternum and sternoclavicular joints. This was originally thought to be infectious, but he never developed a fever or leukocytosis and we feel this was most likely an inflammatory process. I have no idea if this was actually a vaccine side effect, but given the proximity in both time a location and the known complication of shoulder pain with the vaccine, it seems reasonable to give you the information to monitor for other similar cases.

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 56-year-old, male patient, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273, and who developed anaphylactic reaction.    The patient&#39;s medical history included blindness and severe allergies to shellfish.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Losartan and Melatonin.    On 28 JAN 2021, approximately 15  minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Patient&#39;s wife called to indicate that her husband had an anaphylactic reaction to the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Patient received the vaccine on 28 JAN 2021 in his left arm. Patient&#39;s wife indicated that her husband texted her at 3.21 pm to let her know that he has gotten the shot, indicating that he must have received it around 3.19 pm. Patient&#39;s wife indicated that around 3.34 pm, patient said he&#39;d had an anaphylactic reaction, that he had administered a shot of epinephrine and that an ambulance was on its way. The patient&#39;s wife noted that the reaction happened within 15 minutes or so. Once in the hospital, the patient was administered Pepcid and Steroid orally. Additional treatment medication for the event included the previously epinephrine and a shot of Benadryl.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the event was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s significant medical history included severe allergies to shellfish.

Benadryl 25mg PO while he was still able to swallow by RN.   EMS called while he took the Benadryl.  After Benadryl, checked vitals ? VERY hypertensive and increasing diaphoresis; Started to wax and wane with consciousness.  Administered epi pen by RN in attendance once change in level of consciousness was noted.  After epi, became pale, increasing diaphoresis with change in level of consciousness.  BP was lower, still hypertensive.  Placed on floor by staff.  While on the floor, consciousness improved.  EMS arrived and assumed care.

Had some numbness in fingers and toes.  These symptoms were actually more severe that when I had Covid 19. Taking Tylenol would help ease the symptoms, I did rotate in a dose of Ibuprofen on a 2 hour interval one time during the worst of the symptoms. After the 36 hour mark the symptoms faded and I returned to a normal state, although very drained and fatigued. The severity of the symptoms seem like they would be dangerous for someone who is not in good health.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

Continued to &#34;not feel well&#34;. 3/15/21, presented to ED with chest pains and dx with pericarditis again.  Treated with IV Vanco x1 and IV Zosyn x2 until blood work came back and cultures were negative. Due to no infection and negative for an MI, Dr. determined pericarditis was a rxn to the vaccine.   Other tests results include: Elevated BNP, BUN, and CRP.  CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis is clear. 5 covid tests since admission, all negative. IgG antibodies for COVID negative.   PT currently is stable and bloodwork somewhat improved. On O2, fluids and Morphine for chest pain. An acute Hepatitis panel is currently pending.

The patient&#39;s medical history included having COVID-19 in December 2020.  Concomitant product use not provided.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 016M20A) on 10-Feb-2021 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11-Feb-2021, around 2 o&#39;clock in the morning the patient got dizzy, got a fever, sweats, nauseous, had chills, he got dysentery and got sick to his stomach. He was sick about one day or so after that. He slept a bunch. He  looked bad and started sweating. He had a sore arm for a few days. He also had headaches and his muscles were cramping.  Treatment for the event none provided.  The outcome of the events were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the event of dysentery is assessed as unlikely as it is infective etiology, the other events are temporarily association with mRNA-1273 administration, a causal association between the reported events and the product use cannot be excluded. Nausea, chills, injection site pain, headache, pyrexia, fatigue are consistent with the safety profile of the vaccine.
