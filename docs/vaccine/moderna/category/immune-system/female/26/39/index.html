                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

I am a registered nurse at the facility. Starting on 12/30 when I woke up, I had a mild headache. The headache is lingering and intermittent. Starting 1/3, I have a swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit (the same side I received the vaccine). My employer is sending me for a COVID-19 PCR today to rule out any active infection. Tylenol has been taken as needed for the headache.

                                                It was noted during injection a tremendous amount of pain/stinging/burning that lasted a few minutes. About 20 minutes post injection, numbness/tingling noted in pinky/5th finger radiating down palm to wrist on same arm as injection as well as dizziness. Notified observation RNs and moved to a separate room. Mildly elevated BP but normal HR noted. No rash/hives/difficulty breathing. Numbness and tingling would migrate - most often to thumb but sometimes up entire arm. Released 1 hour after injection after no life threatening signs noted.  Visited PCP the next day (1/6) at 10:15. Professional opinion that it is due to swelling from injection - now noticeable area of swelling around injection site. Recommended ice and NSAIDs.

Symptoms progressively improved slowly over time continuing although minimal at this current time. This writer was in route home and pulled over at 2:15 to a Health clinic for this concern. Advised to be monitor. Vitals all stable, no other signs of repository distress. Stayed at clinic until 5:15pm.

                                                At the time of vaccination, a burning sensation was felt immediately upon injection. The person who injected the vaccine proceeded to flick the plastic tubing of the syringe while it was still in my arm, escalating the burning sensation. I let the tech know about the burning and he claimed it could be a side effect of the medication and that I would be fine. I did not suffer any medication related side effects. Left arm stiffness began about two hours after vaccination and after nearly 3 hours, I was completely unable to move my arm. Loss of shoulder posture, complete arm/hand weakness and extreme arm soreness were reported for nearly 5 days. Numbness from the injection site down to the elbow is intermittent currently. Tingling down from the shoulder joint to the fingers is constant when arm is laterally raised or when overused. The left arm is still having trouble externally/internally rotating/raising above my head, and while lifting heavy objects. I&#39;m in the process of starting physical therapy/occupational therapy to regain normal strength and functioning without the tingling or pain. An audible clicking noise is noted that was not there previously to the injection. I am unable to exercise normally and have been functioning at a decreased work and paperwork pace at my job as a nuclear stress technician. I have also been losing days of time at work due to various doctor&#39;s appointments and diagnostic tests needed to identify the problem.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Dec 2020 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: OU520A/011520A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.     On 23 Dec 2020, within minutes of receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction and was rushed to the emergency room (ER). When transported to the ER she began to experience throat swelling, redness of arms and chest, trouble breathing with lower chest pain shooting into lungs, and numbness with tingling in her right arm. Treatment for the event included epinephrine, steroids, and diphenhydramine.  She was released from the ER on 23 Dec 2020.  On 24 Dec 2020 patient awoke with a headache, fatigue, and generalized itchiness. Treatment for the event included ibuprofen and diphenhydramine.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, anaphylactic reaction, right arm numbness and tingling, were reported as resolved on 23 December 2020. The events of headache, fatigue, and generalized itchiness were considered resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 26-year-old female patient who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot OU520A/011520A), and who experienced the unlisted events of anaphylactic reaction, right arm numbness and tingling, and generalized itchiness, and the listed events of headache and fatigue.  The events were considered to be possibly related to the vaccine due to the temporal relationship with onset on the day of vaccination.

                                                Beginning 1/11/2020, I began experiencing an uncomfortable sensitivity in my left axilla. I have a history of  inflamed lymph nodes that occurs 1-2 times a year under the arm and in the groin, and this felt similar to those episodes. The lymph node is hard to touch and the sensitivity continues today. Today (1/13/2020), I noticed an inflamed, red patch of skin that is hot to touch over the region where the injection occurred. Additionally, I have experienced diarrhea 1-2x/day for the past two days.

It is itchy, but doesn&#39;t hurt. It only gets swollen if I itch it and it also gets hot when I itch it. I went and saw my doctor and she prescribed me a topical steroid cream. I have been feeling lightheaded, fatigued and dizzy. That started Thursday January 7.

                                                Two days following administration of vaccine, there was a small, oval shaped redness at injection site about the size of index finger. However, the following day that redness resolved/barely noticeable. Yesterday (1/13/21), I noticed while showering in the morning a huge hard lump on my upper Left arm with circular redness the a little smaller than palm of my hands. The red area grew hotter throughout the day and started to swell. I applied Benadryl gel and took 2 Benadryl 25 mg each in the evening. I tried icing the area as a well. This morning, the hardness and redness are both there. No improvement but it has not worsened either. I tried going to UrgentCare to have it checked out, but was turned away because they didn?t want to be responsible for treating this. I contacted my hospital that gave me this vaccine and they directed me to another clinic, which I may or may not be able to go to because it is a little far from my location. I will continue icing, applying the gel cream, and take a Benadryl   Of note, I had no prior COVID exposure. Following any vaccine, I usually get minor fever/chill (like with Flu shot) which happened with Moderna vaccine as well. But that subsided by the next evening. No fever/chills since then. I also had the commonly reported arm soreness for few days. I have pictures of how the swelling and redness looked like throughout all this as well.

On Friday, (1/15) I noticed that the left-side lymph node in neck/collar bone area was swollen. The area felt similarly to that of a cyst. Starting Friday night, I began taking amoxicillin to prevent a bacterial infection. The swelling/cyst like bump on my neck/collarbone has decreased in size, but the vaccination sight has become very red, swollen, and itchy at times.

I wouldn&#39;t be too concerned about such side effects except it is extremely itchy. To this day it is still reddened, swollen, warm and very itchy. In the beginning there was pain, which I took Tylenol for, but it is no longer painful. As stated before, the itching is what concerns me and how inflamed the site gets if I itch it.

                                                1/19 4:30 PM- extreme body soreness (especially injection site/left arm), headache, chills, and felt like I had a fever (with no fever). 1/19 8:00 PM- Hallucinations began (with eyes closed and open) - started seeing unfamiliar people (faces and outlines), black and white strobing along with seeing pure red light at certain points, I could not control the hallucinations, extreme paranoia (like I was being controlled and watched), physical symptoms magically went away; however, I had pressure in my head that did not hurt like a headache. I was talking to people that were not there. I felt completely out of control. The only thing that helped was forcing myself to focus on the TV, which was extremely difficult. Symptoms started to die down around 3 AM, but did not go away. I slept for 4 hours.  1/20 8 AM- felt like and still feel like I am not in reality, I feel disassociated with my body (like its not mine), slightly out of control of my thoughts, I see subtle black and white flashing like last night but not as intense, paranoia like last night/not as intense, cant concentrate.

I became extremely sweaty with chills and my entire left arm (side of injection) became numb and tingly. The episode lasted approximately 20 minutes, and I was symptom-free within an hour. I never fainted or vomited.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received my first dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 15th. My arm was a little sore that day and the next, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad. Late on Saturday, January 16th I noticed a rash around my neckline/collar bone area that was on both sides, but more prominent on the right. The rash was red with many bumps that were not raised and were not fluid filled or blistering. The next day, Sunday (17th) the rash seemed to worsen but stay localized to that area. Monday morning (18th) I woke up with a tender right armpit indicating to me that I have a swollen lymph node. I noticed later that morning that the rash had spread bilaterally to my biceps and chest. Today is Wednesday the 20th, and while the rash looks slightly better around my neckline, the rash has now spread all over my breasts, abdomen, and a little bit to my hips. The right arm pit continues to be tender today.  I took Benadryl (25 mg) Sunday night (17th) and applied hydrocortisone cream to the rash when it was just along my neckline.

                                                Two days after the shot in Colorado I began to develop a rash on my right arm at the injection site.  I had flown back to North Carolina where I am on a student rotation at a hospital the day after the vaccine (Sunday 1/17).  Since then (Monday 1/18) the rash has expanded to my entire upper arm and is continuing to extend downwards.  I had swelling for about a day but that went away.  I had some swollen lymph nodes in my axilla and neck but they are no longer swollen.  Now my arm remains extremely itching and red.  I went to the ED this evening and they gave me IV Solumedrol, Pepcid, and famotidine.  The rash went away except for outside of a line of demarcation we made earlier in the day.  This morning I woke up with an intense itching in the arm.  I rubbed my hand over it (didn?t itch it) and the redness  came right back.  It is continuing to expand down my arm.

As days have gone on its gotten larger a little larger than orange. It very red, swollen,itchy and HOT. Called my Doctor on the 23rd and she prescribed me bactrim. At this time not much change.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

The small red, raised itchy spot had now increased in size and spread throughout my arm and up in my shoulder. My shoulder now hurts when I raise it up or try and pick anything up certain movements. My arm has a weird feeling in my shoulder all the way to my hand sometimes. It feels tingly at times but is not constant. My skin where the reaction happened is now different. It is rough and different to touch.

                                                Got the vaccine on Feb 17, 2021 at 9am. On Feb 18 at around 8:30-9 pm, left cheek started feeling uncomfortable and a bit swollen. The next morning, swelling was extreme and extremely painful to touch. It was difficult to eat from left side and to laugh and talk. Also, had chills and felt weak.  I scheduled an online appointment with Dr.  he mentioned the condition is called acute pericoronitis and he suggested that vaccine might have increased the immune response to any infection that might have happened underneath the left wisdom teeth which hasn&#39;t come out yet. [Note: Same response had happened when I got my MMR vaccine on Feb. 1, 2021]. He prescribed Amoxicillin 500mg for a week.  As of Feb 22. 11 pm, after taking Amoxicillin and ibuprofen, the swelling has bit reduced but the pain persists.

Lymph nodes stayed swollen after first dose, got worse after second dose, and have been swollen since.   Swollen lymph nodes in neck, hard to breathe, went to hospital, told it was just the vaccine and to wait it out. Lymph nodes in neck went down in swelling after 2-3 days.  Irregular menstrual cycle, started approximately 2 weeks after first dose. Have had a menstrual cycle for 5 days every 9-12 days since first dose.  Hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms (lost vision, couldn&#39;t form sentences) on 5 Feb 21. Discharged after CT scan and MRI came back fine.

D/c on steroid dose pack, beta blockers, cough suppressant. Follow up with cardio and pulm. Now seeing immunologist as well who started me on corticosteroid inhaler, monteleukast. Running more blood work soon. PCP gave albuterol inhaler, did round of antibiotics, orders to use incentive spirometer for breathing capacity. Waiting on pulmonology follow up and 30 day holter monitor, stress ecg, and other cardiac tests.

I ended up throwing up around 4 am on Thursday 12/31/20 at work. Then over the weekend I  felt very lethargic, had body aches, and the hot flashes continued. My left arm hurt as expected, but the soreness went up into the left side of my neck as well. Today (1/3/21) is the first day since I got the vaccine where I no longer have a headache and feel basically back to baseline.

                                                I received my vaccine in my right arm around 3:20 pm on 1/5/21. My right arm started getting sore later that evening. The following day, 1/6/21, my arm was very sore and the injection site was tender to touch. I felt feverish and had chills. I also had a headache and felt very fatigued. I took some Advil that morning. I evaluated my arm in the evening and noticed a large red rash streaking down my right arm from the injection site. It measured approximately 3.5 in X 1.5 in. The rash was red, raised, painful, and firmer than my surrounding skin. I took 500 mg of Tylenol before bed. The next morning, 1/7/21, the rash had grown larger. The border of the rash was marked and I took an antihistamine around 7:00 am. At 1:00 pm the rash had grown larger, now measuring approximately 4.25 in X 2.25 in. My lymph nodes in my right armpit were also beginning to get sore. I visited the nurse practitioner at my hospital?s employee health clinic around 1:40 pm and we agreed to monitor my signs and symptoms at that time. The following morning, 1/8/21, the rash was bigger, but my skin was softer and more of a pink color than red. My arm did not hurt as much, though my right armpit was slightly more sore. Today, 1/9/21, my symptoms are much better. I have only slight soreness in my right arm and armpit. My rash has nearly resolved, though it is slightly itchy where the rash was.

Localized numbness, swelling, redness, heat, soreness present. I drew a circle around the redness &amp; the welt. Within 12 hours, the welt had dissipated, but the redness had grown outside the outline. Swelling decreased, but site was firm, hot, red, and more sore.

I had nausea, chills, felt very lethargic and sore to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand at work, and had a pounding headache.  The site where I got the vaccine was also more tender and sore than usual after a vaccination.  I left work early around 3 pm, took 400 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and tried to get as much sleep as I could.  By 6 am on 1/13/21, all these symptoms had gone away, but now I&#39;ve noticed a very swollen lymph node just above my left clavicle.

The area has remained the same since 1/7/21 and has not increased or decreased in size. However the itch/burn feeling continues to increase daily. I do not plan to seek medical attention for this side effect unless the swelling is still present by dose #2. Im showing no other negative symptoms.

                                                12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn&#39;t cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn&#39;t much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn&#39;t in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn&#39;t seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.

I knew this was a normal side effect so I was not worried.  They faded after a couple of days. However, a week after the injection, these side effects returned. My arm was not as tender but it is itchy, red, warm, and swollen (feels firm.) I doubt it is anything serious but I figured I should report it just in case.

About 10 minutes after that, I became light headed and dizzy again along with chest tightness, palpitations and an itchy throat. My heart rate was in the 110s. My symptoms would be on and off. I received more Benadryl in the ED with no resolution. I then was given an epi pen and prednisone. After this the itchy throat and light headedness resolved. I was observed in the ED for a total of 4 hours. I was discharged with 4 days of prednisone and 2 days of Benadryl.

Had a very restless sleep and woke up with severe sweating around 3 AM. Woke up at 9:30 AM with severe, pounding headache. Attempted to walk around at 10 AM, pounding headache was a 10/10 pain scale when upright. Nausea set in as soon as I was standing, ran to lay down to avoid vomiting. At 10:30 AM I sat up attempted to drink water and the vomiting began. Severe vomiting for about 30 minutes, then intermittent vomiting throughout the day until 6 PM. Headache did not let up all day, no response to medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, rizatriptan, magnesium). Headache subsided around 8 PM and  I was able to sleep. No symptoms today 1/22/21.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

Maybe some mild left tongue swelling. Normal swallowing, normal breathing. No cough. No vomiting or diarrhea. No rash. She called an urgent care who recommended Benadryl, which helped minimize the tingling sensation and swelling over the next 2 days. Over the following week she had soreness at her left jaw joint near her ear and some left eye dryness. No facial droop. Normal blinking and smiling. No facial muscle weakness noticed. She was not sick when she received the vaccine. No new medications. Tolerates NSAIDs normally without reaction. No facial fillers. Never had anaphylaxis before to anything -- foods, medications, injectables, other vaccines. No known PEG allergy. Has not used Miralax before.

No big deal . Well Thursday morning I woke up with a rash on both of my legs and my legs swollen like tree trunks. It?s a petechial rash. I called the pharmacist told to take Benadryl and Zyrtec since Friday. So I went to the doctors last night since I still have this rash and it hasn?t gotten any better with Benadryl and Zyrtec.  I got blood work done today. And I have  to get an arterial and venous Doppler done on Wednesday next week. They are concerned I may have blood clots since my legs are so swollen with a petechial rash. They are also giving me steroid tapper.

On 1/3/2021 my armpit became very swollen and painful, on 1/4/2021 the Right arm where I received the injection became severely painful, dull throbbing ache from shoulder down to my fingers. On 1/5/2021 my Right arm was now swollen, hot to the touch and a small red circle was forming on my bicep and pain continued to worsen. Today 1/6/2021 I saw my primary care physician that confirmed there is swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit and swelling at the site. The redness of the spot increased in size from the size of a dime to now the size of a half dollar.

By hours 40-48, I was still having body aches and fatigue but more severe. In addition, I had light headedness, flushed face, and a ?scratchy? throat (not necessarily sore but felt a little different). I left work and went to urgent care to get tested for Covid-19.

Took Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Acute symptoms dissipated after a couple hours. Continued to feel dizzy when standing/walking. Confusion/short term memory loss of entire afternoon evening (told by others- can?t remember actions, repeating myself and not remembering, can?t remember conversations). About two hours after injection, extreme muscle pain in left arm. Couldn?t lift or move arm and hurt even when not moving, took 440mg naproxen. Brought pain down to a more normal feeling of post shot soreness.

                                                Hours after shot I noticed a large red swollen lump. On 12/31/2020 I showed this to one of my providers and he told me to give him a call if it had not disappeared by 1/4/2021. The redness was slightly better on 1/4 but then became drastically worse on 1/5/2021. I had a low grade fever(100.7), spreading redness, pain, itching, and swelling of left arm, on 1/5/2021 and was told to go to urgent care. I went to urgent care on 1/6/2021 and was diagnosed with cellulitis. My injection site was measured and I was instructed to go to the hospital if after given first and second dose of antibiotic, symptoms did not improve. Redness began to decrease and I did not go to the hospital. As of today, 1/9/2021 my left arm is mildly red and swollen.

I required epinephrine and diphenhydramine. Approximately 3.5hrs following the first dose of epinephrine / diphenhydramine, I had a rebound reaction and new dysphagia and went to the emergency department where I required another dose of epinephrine, IV famotadine, IV diphenhydramine, IV dexamethasone, and IV odanestron to bring the symptoms under control.   No local reaction at the injection site. Angioedema, urticaria, and dysphagia were all solely focused to the head, face, and mouth.

                                                I experienced a very sore arm for about two days after injection on 12/29/2020-12/31/2020  By 1/6/2021 I had noticed near the injection site it was red and inflamed. It was slightly itchy, but I put some cortisone cream on it, kept an ice pack on it and went on with my day. 1/10/2021 during the evening I noticed my arm really warm and the rash had then raised to a more hive/welt like look to it. Still not too itchy but still concerning. On 1/11/2021 It was still red and swollen so I had a PA-C that works near my office take a look at it and they said I should report it accordingly to be safe.

                                                12/31 I had tingling in my throat and was observed in urgent care for two hours with no intervention. It went away by the time I went to bed that night. 1/8 I woke up with a sore arm, did not think much of it and went to work. It was sore all day and when I got home I undressed to take a shower and noticed that it was red, swollen and hot to the touch. I tried hot compresses as I suspected it was cellulitis and marked the borders. It had grown in size the nest morning (1/9) which is when I went back to urgent care and was prescribed 3 days of Keflex. The first dose reduced the swelling and pain in my arm, but by the end of the course of antibiotics it was still red 1/13 I went back to urgent care to be seen for the redness and tenderness. The NP suspected that it may be an immune reaction rather than cellulitis and gave me a single oral dose of decadron with instructions to follow up in 3-4 hours by sending in a picture, and if it did not get better to fill a longer prescription for Keflex. At this point I have taken the prescription to the pharmacy and am waiting until after work to pick it up and begin the script.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning her co-worker, a 28 year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced anaphylaxis reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I went to my local urgent care who prescribed me antibiotics (Cleocin) 3x for 7 days.   I completed the antibiotics on 1/23/2021. On 01/25/2021, I noticed a red rash on my chest, stomach, and inner arms. I returned to the same Urgent Care who confirmed that I am having an allergic reaction. I am prescribed Prednisone and Hydroxyzine.

The rash persisted for 3-4 days before disappearing.  The rash reappeared immediately after the administration of the 2nd dose of the vaccine. I became flushed and dizzy during observation and was kept for a longer observation period. My vitals were normal and I was cleared by a nurse after drinking some water and apple juice. The rash has persisted and is about 4 inches in diameter at this time and remains painful and swollen.

When I looked at it in the mirror, it was swollen and red. It was also warm to the touch. No pain though besides the initial itch. It is about a 1&#34;-2&#34; diameter circle. Today is day 9 after receiving the vaccine and it is still red and slightly swollen but not itchy. No other symptoms present.

                                                Facial edema, oropharyngeal edema; Lip swelling; Throat itching; Tachycardia; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 28-year-old female, patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed lips swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 15 Jan 2021, approximately five minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 15 Jan 2021, five minutes after the vaccine was administered, at 11:15am, the patient complained of lip swelling and throat itching. A healthcare provider assessed the patient and vital signs included, pressure 132/103 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats per minute, and 100 percent oxygen saturation. At 11:22am, the patient had facial edema, oropharyngeal edema and attempted to clear her throat. Vital signs reported at that time included, blood pressure 143/106 mmHg, heart rate 121 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 99 percent. Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine 50mg and epinephrine by injection twice. Emergency services were called to transport the patient, however, the patient declined transport.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, lip swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of lips swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema. The events occurred within minutes after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

                                                I had arm soreness the day of the vaccine (2/11/21). The following day I noticed an erythematous round lesion that was very tender and when palpated felt like a lump. The pain went away 2-3 days after the vaccine and the erythema/lump went away on 2/21/21. On 2/19/21 my left internal arm felt sore. I thought I pulled a muscle perhaps. On 2/21/21 the arm pain was worse and didn&#39;t feel like typical soreness that would come from exercise or sleeping in the wrong position. It was painful when I pulled my arm close to my body, as if something were being compressed. I palpated in the armpit and found a large lump slightly smaller than a golf ball. It was extremely tender and sent me into a panic. Someone pointed out it was the same arm as my vaccination, so I looked it up and learned about this side effect. Today (2/22/21), the pain is gone and the lump is smaller (feel like a typical enlarged lymph node).

But yesterday evening on day 3, I just started to have my upper left arm burn, swell, itch, and turn red. I looked it up online and it turns out I have &#34;COVID&#34; arm which is a rare adverse side effect of the vaccination. It said it would subside in 24 hours to a week. This was not listed on any of the forms I got as a possible side effect so I thought I should report it.

Arm was sore but nothing compared to joints (especially hips). Temperature was only slight at 98.7. Headache and body aches, joint pain were severe enough that I was forced to rest and unable to continue daily activities. Ache symptoms quickly dissipated after 48 hours, but a 2 inch diameter welt appeared, slightly raised and itching mildly like a mosquito bite. Welt is still present now, 5 days post-injection.

                                                I had patient report that she had localized swelling and lymphadenopathy.  I confirmed this on physical exam.  She had localized increased warmth over the left upper outer arm where the vaccine was given at the deltoid.  There was a raised area of skin in a serpiginous pattern circumferentially 3.5 across and 4.5cm in length.  It was blanching and not firm. She had 1 soft lymph node palpable at the left axilla, tender and 1.5cm in size.  She has had no other symptoms other than pain at the injection site for 2 immediately days after the injection was given.  I advised that she fill out the information for v-safe and asked that she report any further program to both v-safe and our office.

Initially the rash did not itch, but as the day progressed, the rash became itchy.  It is raised, red, and warm to the touch.  I took liquid benadryl before going to bed that evening, but when I woke up this morning (1/11/21), the rash is still there and it does still itch on ocasion.

                                                Five days after vaccine dose I started with axillary swelling on left side. Then I started having progressive redness, swelling and itching at injection site. By day 8 (after vaccine) I had a 4x4? hard lump at injection site spreading from my deltoid to my elbow. Numbness and tingling in hand. Swollen, palpable lymph nodes in left armpit. Treated with Keflex and Zyrtec. Symptoms improved after 2 days on antibiotics and resolved after 7 days with the exception of tenderness and soreness which is ongoing. There was question if the vaccine was given too low and how much was in deltoid.

Then I woke up this morning (1/12), and my arm had a red rash, about 2-3 cm each way from where the vaccine was administered. It is itchy and warm. I have no other symptoms.

                                                approximately 1/7/2021 I developed a small rash at the injection site that I noticed around 8:30 pm. This rash was spotty and irregular in shape and did not itch, but was hot to the touch. The following morning the rash had grown into a 2 inch wide and 2 in long bright red rash that was raised and swollen. Still hot to the touch but no itching. As of today the rash is no longer fully red on the inside but has left a small red raised ring of the outline of the initial rash which appears to be spreading outward. Another coworker of mine also reported the same symptom 2 days after the onset of my rash developed. I  attended a virtual visit with a physicians  assistant to take an oral antihistamine for a few days to see if the rash subsides.

I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen, and it took me 3 hours until I could have some relief and feel asleep. Chills fever and body aches I had for 3 days and it reached 100.7 on Christmas day. By Saturday no more fever but the pains were still there. Sunday I was fatigued and all those days I had pretty bad night sweats (about 5 nights). My nausea was so bad that one of the doctors I work with prescribed me some Phenergan that I took Christmas eve and day to help me be able to hold something in my stomach.

Noticed on  morning of 1/8/21 that skin at injection site was itchy and a rash had broken out.  By the next day, 1/9/21, the rash had grown larger, extremely red, and was hot to the touch. Drew a circle around the rash to monitor growth, took a Benadryl. By afternoon of 1/10/21, rash appeared to have grown slightly larger, but significantly less red and temperature and swelling had reduced. Seemed to be gone by 1/11/21. Tonight, 1/14/21, around 6:30pm, I noticed that the skin was itchy at the injection site again, and that a rash had begun to break out once more. Will continue to monitor it.

                                                Received 1st vaccine 1/5/21. Arm was tender. Around midnight 1/6/21 my arm was very painful to the touch, move, awful. 24 hours later just sore. On 1/7/2021 I started to feel short of breath and run down. Sinus infection symptoms. I was sent home from work to get a COVID swab. That evening I lost my taste and began to feel achey. Negative test on 1/10/21. Saw urgent care on 1/9/21 for Covid swab and visit. He diagnosed viral and was sure I was positive. On 1/11/21 my energy returned and I wasn?t achey. Congestion and cough. By 1/13/21 felt fine other than lingering wet cough. This morning, 1/14/21 I noticed my arm itched and looked at it and I?ve got a small red rash around the injection sight and tenderness on palpation.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine on 01/06/2021. Normal pain at the injection site occured with little concern. Pain in armpit began 01/08/2021. I did not think anything of it, believing the pain to be from an ingrown hair caused by shaving or just something with the vaccine. I ignored it to spend time with family. On 01/12/2021 I noticed the pain had not subsided and deepened into the armpit causing pain to radiate from the area when lifting or moving heavy items.  I palpated the area and felt a pea sized lump. It moved freely. I could not locate it again. I continued to palpate into the top of my shoulder and discovered a large lump in the clavicle area. It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system. I also did research on side effects of the Moderna vaccine but observed most people to have lymph node symptoms for only 24-48 hours within three days of receiving the vaccine then they subside.  I made an appointment that same day, 01/12/2021, with Dr. at clinic to be examined. At first, Dr was dismissive of my symptoms. Dr did physically examine my areas of complaint and scheduled an ultrasound for 01/15/2021 at  Hospital. On 01/13/2021 I noticed the injection site began to ache again. On 01/14/2021 I awoke from a nap at 6pm. I began showering for work when I felt a burning, itchy sensation on my inner left bicep. I observed two red spots on my inner left bicep close to my armpit with a red rash below the two red spots. I palpated the red spots to find a large and slightly smaller lump under the skin corresponding with the red spots. The rash itches. As of 01/15/2021, the ultrasound had to be rescheduled by the hospital as their ultrasound technician cannot make it into work because of a blizzard. I now have two lumps in the clavicle area that alternate swelling and reducing in size. I&#39;ve been taking tylenol every four hours when I&#39;m awake to control the pain. The ones in my clavicle now cause tension in the left side of my neck. I&#39;ve also applied warm compresses on the affected sites. It helps lessen the swelling for a bit but does come back.

She started to feel better and left. Started to feel bad in the car on the way back to work. Her boss is a dentist and advised her to take Benadryl, which she did.  Traveling to Hospital now.  She has not yet been seen by a physician. Current symptoms are throat constriction, hard time swallowing, and having a hard time concentrating.  She is pale and feels unwell.   Wed Jan 13, 2021 16:09  Followed up with patient.  Patient is currently in the Emergency Room at Hospital. She has so far received steroids and benadryl.   Thurs Jan 14, 2021 08:56 Followed up with the patient again.  She returned home from the first ER visit at 17:30 last night.  About 4 hours after that her heart rate became elevated again (130-140 bpm while lying down) and she was confused, lethargic, and had a HA and backache. She went back to ER last night around 21:30. They gave her more benadryl in IV and toradol for the HA. She is now on PO benadryl every 4 hours for 4 days. Symptoms today include: runny nose, feels like a mild case of flu, HA and backache. Upon awaking this morning, prior to the morning dose of benadryl, her heart rate was a little elevated. She was also told she could alternate Tylenol or ibuprofen prn and use OTC cold remedies but hasn&#39;t needed any. The doctor said she is not a candidate for the next the second vaccine dose.

The area was hot to touch and continued to spread. The area has been marked with a sharpie and the redness continues to spread. It is Saturday so I have to wait until Monday for my primary care office to open for further treatment. Currently I am utilizing oral benadryl, benadryl cream, cold compresses, and ibuprofen.

Three days after the vaccination I woke up with my face completely swollen one eye was swollen shut and my upper lip was extremely heave and yet icing my face the swelling went down a lot about two weeks after the vaccination I started slowly losing taste but ONLY with salty foods.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

Body hurt so much that it made it difficult to sleep. By next morning, all symptoms had subsided; however, felt weak and tired.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/19/2021 at my place of employment. Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

When I got to work, I looked at my arm and it was very swollen, red, warm, firm, and itchy. By Sunday 1/17, I started to see progress with the swelling, warmth and redness.  It is still mildly itchy. Please note, when I got the vaccine on 1/06/21, I had the normal side effects of arm soreness, fatigue, mild muscle aches and a mild headache; all of these symptoms were gone by Friday 1/08/21. I saw [vaccine administrator] and she instructed me to use ice and hydrocortisone cream.  I iced it for 4 days and there was no change until day 4 (Sunday). I also used Aleve during this time as well. I saw my PCP on Monday 1/18 and she told me to continue the current treatment of ice and Alieve and to update her on Wednesday 1/20.&#34;

                                                Originally had a red mark show up for the first few days after the shot but read in all my paperwork that that was normal. That subsided after about a week and then was gone and though I could see a faded outline of where it had been, I wasn?t worried. About four days ago, a huge red ring appeared on my arm at my injection site overnight like a bullseye that?s red and raised on the outside, pink inside the ring, and bluish in the middle. It?s furiously itchy, and hot to the touch. It grows bigger day by day. I showed it to my boss. (I work as a pharmacy technician where we give these shots, where I got mine) and she shrugged saying She had no idea what it was and nobody else had complained of anything like it. My mother in law is an RN and she and my mom both think it looks like ringworm. I called my doctor to ask for medical advice but they haven?t returned my call and I can?t afford the medical bills to go to the emergency room for a rash.

                                                The evening of Friday January 29th my face began to experience itching and burning as well as hive like bumps. I did not take anything for that at the time. I woke up the next morning with my face extremely sensitive with red splotches and it was still very itchy. I then noticed the arm that had the injection was hard and was also experiencing the same symptoms as my face and increased soreness. I took Benadryl that evening and woke up Sunday with improved symptoms but still noticeable soreness in the area of the injection and it was still a little red and hot to the touch. It is now Monday morning and the reaction has continued to improve with still some soreness and a little hot to the touch.

                                                received her second dose of the Moderna vaccine today (lot # 028L20A) around 5:45pm; by 6:06 we brought her into the allergy room for itching on her stomach and arms, with flushing on her face and neck. She felt anxious but denied SOB, CP, dizziness, N/V/D. She had no rash or hives.  We called Allergy, placed her in the supine position with ice packs on her chest and gave her 10mg Cetirizine around 6:06pm. We had her wait an additional 15 minutes in the allergy room in the supine position. Her symptoms improved and felt comfortable going home. We gave her an additional 10mg tablet of cetirizine to go home with in case she felt these symptoms again later tonight. Her Vitals at 6:06 SpO2 99%, HR 90 (supine) BP 129/82.

                                                Around 5:30 PM I began experiencing normal symptoms like headache and muscle ache. At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

However, that evening my lips swelled and my hands and feel swelled along with being itchy on the hands and feet. I took a zyrtec and was better by morning.

All hand joints and wrists sore. Soreness to toes and heels while walking but not at rest. Applied ice to fingers, then turned up heat. 1/1 3-4am finger edema/erythema totally resolved 8am foot pain starts resolving 5pm still with mild wrist pain, mild foot pain. Rash evolving -- most lesions improved but some have coalesced, new lesions on neck  Never any fever, checked x2, Tmax 99.0F. Did not end up taking any medications since my symptoms seemed to be resolving. Only other possible recent exposures were a new lotion tried 12/27 (but only applied to face, was careful to keep it away from my lips, and I did not have any rash on my face except the swollen lip) and a new dress that I did not pre-wash (but I had few lesions on my arms which would have also been exposed).

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

The health staff observing will also be submitting a VAERS report, as they provided interventions to the patient.

                                                The onset of symptoms started around 9:15am. I experienced numbness and tingling to bilateral feet and lower legs. I experienced dizziness. I also experienced an increased heart rate (160s-170s BPM). I was hyperventilating and had difficulty with breathing. I was pale and cold.  I had uncontrollable shakes. My BP was a bit higher than my normal but not hypertensive.  I was given candy and juice after onset of symptoms. ( I did have an English muffin prior to receiving the vaccine). My symptoms subsided for some time but then came back about 15 minutes later. These symptoms continued to occur about every 15 minutes for a period of close to 2 hours. I was given Benadryl 50mg PO after the first hour of symptoms. I continued to experience the symptoms for up to about 45 minutes after being given Benadryl. My symptoms began to subside and eventually stopped after the 2 hour mark.

She was scared to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Then she said she did feel SOB and throat feels tight. I grabbed the EPI pen and injected 0.3mg into lateral right thigh. Brought patient to our emergency room, administered Benadryl 25mg (2 caps) po. Started IV NaCl 1000 mL in RAC. Administered famotidine 20mg/2ml IPV over 2 minutes. Currently on slow IV drip, 2nd bag. Patient is doing well. She was initially shaky after the EPI pen but throat did not feel tight less than 10 minutes after injection. Currently is relaxed as I monitor her. Vitals have been stable.

                                                Day 5 post vaccine - 2100 I woke up with sudden hot flash, increased heart rate and sudden shaking chills.   I felt asleep around 0100 the next morning- missed work this day. Went for COVID test (negative) and about 30 minutes post test began feeling weak and faint. Went to Emergency Dept, receive a liter of normal saline.   By vital signs I remained orthostatic( hypoxia and tachycardia upon standing) symptoms remained the rest of the day.  1/5- fatigued but other symptoms resolved  1/6-  symptoms resolved 100%

                                                I received my vaccination at my place of work. Local pharmacy came in to administer them.  In less then a minute of recieving the vaccination I experienced a tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  I told my symptoms to the  pharmacist that was there.  I had to take my mask off due to the difficulty breathing.  I sat down and was trying to catch my breath.  Roughly 10 -15 minutes passes then my throat began to swell.  My extremities were feeling tingly and I was very dizzy.  I sat with my neck extended to maintain my airway until they could locate some benedryl.  My voice was wheezy when attempting to answer questions the pharmacist was asking.  The pharmacist wanted to administer the EpiPen but I would not allow her to because then they would have to call 911.  It took about 45 minutes in total to locate benedryl.  I took 50 mg.  Roughly 15 -20 minutes after taking the benedryl I was able to breath with ease.  I waited about another 15 minutes at the facility to ensure I was ok.  I was told I would not be recieving the second dose due to my anaphylactic reaction.

                                                About 12hrs after the vaccine was administered, I was at work and wearing nitrile gloves. After 10 minutes, the gloves began burning my hands so badly that I couldn&#39;t wear them any longer. I have never had an allergy or an adverse reaction to the gloves I was using. I washed my hands and attempted a different pair of nitrile gloves by a different manufacturer and had the same reaction. I then put on latex gloves, which still caused a burning sensation, but not to the same degree as the nitrile.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

On Saturday morning, I had a large red oval-shaped spot on my arm, starting about half an inch under the injection site. It was hot to the touch and the skin felt harder than the surrounding skin. It was not itchy or painful, but did cause some minor discomfort if I raised my arm high. Today, the color has faded to pink, but it is still a similar size.

                                                I received the vaccination on 1/14 and started to get an itching sensation that night - nothing noticeably or concern and was able to go to sleep. The next morning I was very itchy and red and started to break out in hives that started to get worse and spread through my body. I took Benadryl throughout the day and at night to help my sleep. On Saturday morning my eyes were swollen and red, I had severe hives all over my body and had to go to the ER for some type of relief. This was immediately after I woke up, the right side of my body was extremely hot and I went to the restroom and looked in the mirror and didn&#39;t recognize myself. At the ER, they put me on Prednisone - to take 2 tablets for 3 days, Famotidine - taking 1 tab, 2 times a day for 5 days, and Benadryl, 1 tab, 3X a day until the symptoms subside - It is currently 1/19 and my skin will start to heat up, primarily in my hands and start to itch, but no more hives or anything severe.  I am currently pregnant with my first child, due date 7/7/2021. I have had no previous pregnancies, miscarriages, or abortions.

Six days after vaccine was given, I experienced an enlarged lymph node on the left side base of my neck. The lymph node was about the size of a dime, firm, and tender to the touch. Minimal armpit pain was experienced (similar to an ingrown hair), except there wasn&#39;t an ingrown hair. On the 7th day, about  15 hours after noticing the enlarged lymph node, swelling and tenderness has reduced, but has not disappeared completely.

About 1am I developed a fever of 101.5 which had went to 102.1 and for 24 hrs I could not get it down below 101.   On Tues I woke up at 2am soaked in sweat but the fever had broke for about 12 hrs. I developed another fever of 100.5 but it went away with no medication.  I felt better the next day but the fever returned later along with SOB and because the fever returned it prompted me to go to the urgent care where a chest xray was done.  The xray showed my lungs were inflamed.  On 1/19 I developed the same SOB, chest tighness and another fever of 101.  I reached out to my doctor and had an office visit where another xray was done but normal and was started on the Flovent enhaler to help with the SOB and breathing.

                                                After the vaccine I got chills beginning at 10pm.  About 1am I got a fever but was already taking started tylenol and motrin because I developed a headache also.  The fever went as high as 101.2.  On Tuesday I woke at 2am soaked in sweat and the fever had broke.  Later that day the fever returned at 100.5 but broke on its on.  By Saturday I woke up again with SOB and super cold.  Fever had returned at 101 so I went to Urgent Care  because the fever just kept returning.  A chest xray was done and it showed my lungs were really inflammed.  The fever returned later but went away.  The SOB is still here.  And on  1/19 I got the same feeling with SOB, 101.1 fever and felt awful all over again. So I visited with my PCP and another chest Xray and blood work was done again.  The chest xray showed normal but was started on a Flovent enhaler to help with the breathing and SOB.

First 5 day (Tuesday-Sunday) symptoms: swollen, sore, red, &amp; bruised arm at injection spot; body aches, joint  pain of knees, fatigue, no energy, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache, chills, nausea.  I felt better on the 6th day (Sunday), the injection site looked like it was healing and going back to normal on my shoulder. Then on 7th day (Monday) my injection spot started to itch and break out in a huge hive and little hives around it.  It turned into a bright red circle around the injection spot.  It was hot to touch and very swollen. On 8th to current day (11th) my arm keeps getting worse with the swelling, hotness, itching, &amp; redness, and spreading down my arm.

Had I been in the office I would have had to go home ill, and I could not do much but try to rest during this time.

                                                I had hives despite having taken my daily dose of Claritin that seemed to get worse as the day continued. I reached out to my Healthcare clinic and they were unsure if there was a simple treatment and almost required me to go the emergency room for this. I conducted a telehealth consultation with a doc who was not my primary care physician and was unfamiliar with my preexisting exercise urticaria condition that occasionally results in light hives but never anaphylaxis for me without Claritin. I declined going to the emergency room since this did not seem that serious and instead took another Claritin to try to get the somewhat worsening hives with no apparent cause to stop without an unnecessarily escalated situation. My throat was slightly itchy but I never became anaphylactic likely due to taking an additional Claritin and not doing anything requiring physical effort for the day beyond telecons from home because I left the office to telework mid morning after I started getting continually slightly worse hives. By evening I was ok and the next day just had a slightly sore throat but was able to work and just started the day with 2 Claritin without any further instance of hives appearing. The day after that I returned to my standard 1 Claritin dose with no ill effects. From this event, it seems clear that a 72 hour downing period from dose 1 is insufficient and should be upped to 96 hours. Prior to this more severe event, I had, on days 2 and 3, a sore left arm at injection site that prevented me from even reasonably lifting my arm to a height sufficient to grab my cell phone off it&#39;s charger while lying in bed without serious discomfort. That level of arm discomfort prevented me from working out or would have prevented me from anything other than light office work involving my vaccine arm. My level of tiredness for the couple days following this dose also required that I take an hour long nap days 1 and 2, and no nap at all is usually the norm for me.

Chest felt tight, upper stomach in extreme discomfort,  Hard to see, lights hurting eyes, seeing spots in the air.  Sound became amplified and began to experience a migraine.  &#34;People talking low to me felt like they were screaming into my ear drums.&#34; Extreme fatigue so could barely keep eyes open.  Standing was difficult; moved to wheelchair. Most symptoms lasted 2 to 3 days.  Fever of 102 on first day only.  Fatigue for one week.  Right upper arm, not at the injection site, had a &#34;hive&#34; about the size of a nickel that has not gone away (as of 2/23/21).   New migraines with light sensitivity that affect ability to work also have not gone away (as of 2/23/21).

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

                                                1 week after vaccine I developed a small circular red rash at my injection site. In 24 hours it grew to a red circular rash approximately 5x6 inches. The rash is warm to the touch and itchy. I also developed a severe headache and chills with the rash. I was seen at the urgent care clinic for it and they suspect it might be cellulitis and prescribed me keflex. After being on keflex for one day, the rash is still growing in size. 3 other people at my workplace who received the vaccine have reported similar rashes 1 week after receiving the vaccine.

                                                10:47a went into a room to wait for 15 minutes directly after the injection. Began to feel somewhat dizzy right afterwards. Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

It was gone on the third day.  A week and a day after injection the itchy red circle appeared in larger size and more defined circle. Disappeared the next day. On day 12 after injection the rash had expanded to almost half my arm. It was a bit itchy at times and this time it was not circular, instead irregular shape with defined square like borders on one end. It lasted 2 days, disappeared and hasn?t come back yet.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

                                                I am 16 days post first Moderna injection and I currently still have swollen and tender lymph nodes under my right arm pit, around the back of my right upper arm and into my upper back.   The day after the vaccine I felt feverish, had severe fatigue, muscle aches and headache.  Those symptoms lasted approx 10-12 hours and I have no longer experienced them.  I noticed the pain in my arm pit and swelling the following day and it has continued.

Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

                                                Just over 24 hours after I received the COVID-19 vaccine I had a syncope episode while standing talking to others at work. I began feeling hot, started feeling like I was sweating, started seeing black and white lines, and then fainted. The symptoms came on very quickly. I did not remember falling and we believe I hit my head on the corner of a table when I fell, and I had to get 3 staples in my head. I have no other medical concerns at this time, and all of the test run at the ER showed no concerns. At the ER they ran labs, took a CT scan, and did an EKG. I was released from the ER after about 4 hours. I have had a 3 other episode previously when I felt like I was going to pass out, most recent March 2020, but they were linked to the flu and strep. This event has not been linked to either of those conditions at this time, and my doctor encouraged me to report it.

                                                10 minutes after vaccination had a large localized site reaction. Was kept at the hospital to be watched for approximately 45 minutes.  12 hours later night sweats, headache, site reaction cleared up.  8 days later (1/14/21) site became red, hot, and very inflamed. I had a similar reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine in September so I immediately contacted my allergist. I immediately took prednisone as instructed by my doctor and went in for an appointment. About 4 hours after the new site reaction, joint pain and malaise began. I&#39;m continuing on a steroid regimen for treatment.   Today 1/16/21 I am still having joint pain and swelling. Site on my arm is mostly cleared up.

Worse when lying down and almost felt short of breath. The heart palpitations continued until Monday night and Tuesday I woke up and palpitations resolved. I have only ever had this reaction one other time when had the Mirena. Symptoms resolved after having it removed but wasn?t sure what ingredients caused it. Now I believe there may be a common ingredient.

                                                Developed dizziness and nausea within 90minutes of vaccine; then developed tingling, and flushing of my skin. Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

Within a few hours, face began to flush and feel hot and itchy.  Saw a NP who ruled out cellulitis and recommended Benadryl.  Took 2 Benadryl tablets by noon on day 8 and almost immediately noticed facial itching/&#34;hot&#34; sensation improving. Within 2-3 hours, rash began to fade in color. Continued taking Benadryl as directed on box and by the end of day 9 rash had almost faded to nothing with no residual symptoms remaining.

                                                12 hours after injection (1/8/2021) I began running a low grade fever (99.8), experiencing a debilitating headache, had injection site tenderness as well as swelling the size of a baseball. I iced the injection site and put compression on, in case it was a hematoma from the injection. From 1/8/2021 -1/10/2021 I continued to run a low grade fever, never reaching above 100 degrees. I had full body aches and was exhausted as if a bus ran me over. The injection site swelling slowly reduced with continued ice and compression. From 1/10/2021 - 1/13/2021 I did not have a fever, however I continued to experience intermittent headaches that were as painful as several days prior. I felt chronically exhausted as well. On 1/14/2021 I began to run a low grade fever again (99.8). At this point the injection side swelling was a 6.5cm x 5cm ring of what I believe to be induration. Headache and exhaustion persisted. Friday 1/15/2021 I did not have a fever, but I began to notice that simple tasks such as walking to the kitchen were increasingly difficult. When checked, my oxygen saturation was 98 percent, but my heart rate was 115 while sitting. Saturday 1/16/2021 I began running a fever again, this time reaching 100 degrees. I developed a full body rash, red spots never raised. Again, I continued to have extreme exhaustion and headaches and tachycardia. I took some benadryl to help with the rash. Sunday 1/17/2021 the rash and fever returned, headaches and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia continued. Monday 1/18/2021 I began having a sore throat, fever and rash developed again. Headache and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia as well. Tuesday 1/19/2021 my fever elevated to 100.5, headache, exhaustion, sore throat, tachycardia. However, by Tuesday there was no longer red visible spots. My entire body still itched and felt as if there was a burning sensation, however I could not find any visible red spots to correlate with the itching and burning. Today Wednesday 01/20/2021 I have never felt worse. My entire body feels like it has been repeatedly ran over by a semi truck. My throat hurts. My head hurts. My body burns as if it&#39;s on fire. I am so incredibly tired I feel like it&#39;s an extreme sport just to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom. My fever today 01/20/2021 reached a new 101.4, I&#39;m still tachycardic. Oxygen saturation is within normal limits. However, the induration around the injection site seems to have almost completely resolve.

                                                The vaccine itself was well tolerated with just some injection site pain and minor body aches the next day. Then, last night I took miralax and had an allergic reaction to it. I have taken miralax in the past and I have tolerated it well. This is my first time taking miralax since the Covid vaccine and I suspect it is related since there is polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. About 10 minutes after taking the miralax (in water) I had chest and throat tightness, rash on my chest and face, severe facial flushing, and itching. After that began to resolve I had chills, rigors, and aches in every joint. I had not eaten or consumed anything else and had no exposure to any other potential allergens.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 10:45a, I then went next door to be monitored for 15 minutes. Within a few minutes, I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I waited out the 15 minutes and went back to my office. When I got into my office I still felt lightheaded and I informed my supervisor. I explained to him that I was going to try and eat something and drink some water and I would feel better. I went into my office and continued to work for the next hour. After that hour, I began to feel very dizzy and &#34;out of it&#34; as I almost didn&#39;t know where I was at. I went to speak to my supervisor and I sat down in his office where I almost fainted. He took me back to my office where I sat with another co-worker. Duri time, I continued to feel light headed, although it came in waves. My husband drove me home, I showered, ate something and was feeling better. Around 6:00p, I began to feel lightheaded again and began to experience body aches, hot and cold flashes that would come in waves. Saturday morning, I woke up feeling better, but around 10:00a I began to experience the same symptoms. I laid down for a few hours that would get up and attempt tasks around the house, then I would  ended up back in bed at 6:00p with the same symptoms again. I did meet virtually with a doctor and she explained to me to wait it out. On Monday, I met with my pcp and she informed me of the same, that these symptoms would eventually go away. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the only symptom that remained was the dizziness. At times, I still will feel dizzy for instance Saturday morning I woke up and felt pretty dizzy throughout the day.

                                                On January 21st I woke up at 3:00 am with a small rash on my left arm, where I received the vaccine. I put an ointment and took Allegra 24 hour to treat reaction. On January 22, 2021 I woke up with two more spots on my arm so I went to go see my doctor and I was given a shot at the clinic and also prescribed an ointment and oral medication (I do not have them with me at this time). On the evening of January 22 , my arm (near the shoulder area) swelled and got red. It is a hot and burning sensation on the area of reaction with redness and swelling. At this time, most of the swelling and redness went down,  but I am still dealing a mild burning sensation and mild swelling. I will still taking the 24 hour Allegra along with the oral medication and ointment I was prescribed yesterday.

                                                I got the vaccine on Jan 5th. Felt fine that night but the next morning I had an inflammatory response. Every area of my body that I&#39;ve injured as an adult was swollen and sore. My jaw where I had my wisdom teeth removed last year, my knee that I had surgery on about 2 years ago, any part that had previously had been injured. That night I was tired but felt back to normal on the 7th. On the 13th I went to the gym and did upper body and that night I started to have a reaction at the injection site. On the 14th my arm had swelled significantly and turned bright red, I went to our health clinic and was put on steroids to calm things down. I think exercising my upper body a week after the shot made me have that reaction, like exercising the muscle made the vaccine secrete faster or something.

On the 27th, the bumps became one large red patch which became itchy and burned and was hot to the touch. I put hydrocortisone on it, iced it, and took a Zyrtec - it is still here. Will be taking Benadryl tonight to see if that will get rid of it.

                                                It was 7 mins after the shot, I started feeling my throat closing up, like a golf ball. they gave me an epi pen it helped a little bit but went to the ER. When the epi wore off I was having issues, I had it again 4-5 times. I had a hard time getting air in and out. I was admitted to the ICU for an Epi drip. The stayed over night and they winged me off the Epi and sent me home.  I was home for a couple days, and in my kitchen not doing anything I felt like my air way was closing, my husband gave me Epi pen and took me to the ER. They have more IM Epi  (3x) and steroids and Benadryl.  I had  a CT of my brain because I had the worst headache and it came back ok. I was there for 6-8 hours and it cleared up after 3 doses of Epi.  A week after I was eating in the Cafeteria, my throat started to itch and took the Epi pen and gave myself a dose and took Benadryl, it did not get better. I ended up really struggling to catch my breath, I went down to the ER and they gave me another Epi and started Epi drip- I went again to the ICU for the night, more Epi, steroids and Benadryl. By the morning I felt a lot better and went home.  I have seen my PCP and waiting to see my Allergist.  Randomly I have just been getting rashes, my face, cheeks and nose, patchy rashes that will come and go.

                                                Patient presented for Covid-19 vaccine clinic.  She did report a previous reaction to influenza vaccine, but she premedicated with benadryl for that.  She did not premedicate for covid vaccine. Approximately 20 minutes after her vaccination, she was observed in the post vaccine waiting area and  stated that she was a bit dizzy and tickling in her throat.  In addition, she had an itchy rash on her left forearm, the side in which her vaccine was given. She was escorted to the nearest exam room.  There, she began to have nearly non-stop coughing to the point of gagging.  She was given epi 0.3mg im with some improvement of symptoms. Continuous monitoring showed oxygen sats in the upper 90s, BP was in the 150s systolically. She was given 50 mg of Benadryl orally.  At that point, patient was taken to the procedure room via wheelchair.  After approximately 30 minutes, the ticking sensation in the throat returned and patient was having more difficulty breathing.  Another epi 0.3mg im  was given, along with pecid 40 mg po.  125 mg of Solumedrol was given IV, with saline lock left in place.  After 20 minutes, patient again was having difficulty. Another epi 0.3mg was given and EMS activated.  While awaiting EMS, an albuterol neb was given. EMS activated ALS.  Patient left facility in stable condition, transported to hospital. Pt received another 0.3mg of epi im enroute to hospital. Pt was in good condition at hospital and discharged to home. Pt returned to ER the following day with c/o cough, neb and prednisone given and discharged home. Pt returned to ER again on 1/2/21 with c/o elevated BP 170/80&#39;s.

                                                Around 10 am (2hrs post vaccination) I noticed some hives on my hands and dizziness. I also developed a mouth sore that later went away around 5pm. I drank 1.5 L of water and put some topical Benadryl cream on the hives, these symptoms resolved. At 8pm I began to get a temperature (temp max 101.2 around 11:17pm), a very sore swollen arm, massive headache, and myalgia/arthralgia in knees bilaterally. On 1/5 temperature has subsided to low grade (99.2F) but I still don?t feel well and have no sense of smell with a runny nose.

Self-examination revealed tender lymphadenopathy with size between 1-2cm. Mild itching around the injection site was noted the evening of 12/30/20. A small, irregularly shaped erythematous rash was noted around the injection site the morning of 12/31/20 - over about 24 hours this darkened to be tan/brown as compared to surrounding skin. There was gradual resolution of pain/tenderness, lymphadenopathy, and rash by approximately 1/1/21.

Tonight the swollenness and itchiness is traveling into left armpit as well.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

Continued to increase in size over the next 72 hours. 6 days later site is back to the size of a half dollar, red and itchy tender site. Has since reduced from a ?lump? to more flat. Took 599mg Tylenol 1/5/2021 and again 1/6/2021. Unable to take Benadryl due to sensitivity (over sedation) with household and family responsibilities. Sore throat also present for first 72 hours but went away.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had soreness and mild fatigue. The soreness and stiffness was greatest in the arm of injection, and was less intense but present in my upper back and neck. This soreness and stiffness lasted the whole day after the vaccine but was becoming milder, until day 2 after the vaccine when it had completely resolved. No medications were required.  Day 1 after vaccine I also had a bright red, flat, rash that appeared as very close small circles near the injection site (where the bandage was placed) but not on the actual vaccine site. No itching, spreading of rash, or other symptoms. This resolved day 2. I have no known allergies to bandages at this time. No medications were required.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Returns to clinic at 0739. Had first dose of Moderna vaccine at 0715 today.  She states that immediately after her lips felt tingly.  She states that she was driving home and she began to feel tingling and numbness into her face around her mouth.  Patient denies having any allergies. Was walking her to the ED and she was talking to nurse, all of a sudden she leaned forward and was coughing and grabbing her throat. Rapid response team called, patient transferred to ED. She gets influenza thoughts without difficulty.  She denies any current URI symptoms no history of heart or lung problems high blood pressure or diabetes.  She denies numbness or tingling in her hands currently.  Currently very nauseated. Patient was given some BENADRYL and some Zofran was watched she still complained of some perioral numbness some labs were obtained potassium is minimally low at 3.5 calcium is also low at 8.1.  This time I suspect this is more of an adverse reaction to immunization shot however if the tingling or numbness persists then a recheck of her electrolytes may be warranted follow-up primary care physician.

                                                Around 8 minutes post-vaccination patient started complaining of itching in her eyes and legs. RN in room with patient, vitals obtained immediately.  While obtaining patients vitals, patient started to feel tingling on her face starting at her cheeks and going down towards her mouth, but no itching or swelling of mouth, throat, or tongue.  NP brought into room to evaluate patient and Benadryl 50 mg given at 1125.  Patient expressed that tingling was spreading to jaw and down into neck.  911 called at 1127 per recommendation from NP.  While waiting for EMT&#39;s to arrive, patient complained of tingling down to her chest at 1133, and the tingling progressed down to her legs at 1136.  Patient still denied any difficulty breathing, trouble swallowing, shortness of breath, swelling of mouth, lips, and/or tongue. Patient was able to talk without any difficulty during the entire event. EMT&#39;s arrived at 1139 and patient walked out to ambulance without assistance and was transported to ER for evaluation.  At ED, pt reports she started getting tingling sensation all over her body, fullness sensation in her throat, feeling flushed, itching eyes and all over her body within 10 minutes of receiving vaccine. Pt notes she has had antibiotic allergies in the past that are very similar to this experience. Pt also endorses numbness/tingling sensation stretched from head to just below abdomen.  Pt received famotidine 20 mg IV x 1, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1, 1L NS IV x 1 (in addition to diphenhydramine 50 mg PO x 1 she received at clinic). Pt states she felt no improvement so diphenhydramine 50 mg IV x 1 ordered. Half hour later pt felt she wsa not getting worse, but not better and she stated her thoat felt full and she had tingling all over. Pt received albuterol 2.5 mg nebs x 1 and epinephrine 0.3 mg IM x 1.  Discharged to home with prescrpitions for Medrol Dosepak 4 mg PO tabs x 6 days, famotidine 40 mg PO QHS x 5 days, hydroxyzine 25 mg PO QID PRN x 5 days.

                                                Beginning Saturday morning, I began to experience hives, coming and going throughout the day. There were 2 significant episodes on Saturday, one Sunday morning, two throughout the day on Monday. Beginning Tuesday morning, I experienced hives that continued throughout the day. Starting around 1:00 pm, they moved from a more localized area on my upper trunk to covering my entire body, head to toe. I became hypotensive (lowest was 90/60), tachycardic (pulse rate ranging from 100-125), low grade temperature (100.4), noticed a tingling feeling in my lips, a new onset sore throat, and ringing in my ears. My pulse ox remained stable, no oxygen required. I took a claritin chewable approximately 10 minutes after onset of worsening symptoms, then 50 mg of benadryl 3 hours later.  I have continued to take 25 mg of benadryl BID since Tuesday and have remained without any new onset of hives. No medical admissions were required, although I do work in a medical clinic and close observation was available for me.  Only symptom remaining is fatigue, unsure if this is related to benadryl usage or remaining vaccine reaction.

                                                Got the 1st dose of Covid vaccine on 1/8/21.  Left arm was sore  and have a swollen lump but it is a common reaction.  Left arm stop hurting after 1 day but the lump is still there.  On 1/12/21,  I start noticing my underarm starting to hurt.  I thought I pulled a muscle or maybe a swollen lymph node. Did a self examination no swollen lymph so I thought it was a pull muscle. Been taking Advil twice a day but now it is the 1/14/21 underarm still hurt and the lump on the left arm is still there and slightly swollen now. Still taking Advil twice a day due to left underarm pain.

                                                I was vaccinated on 01/07/2021.  I did have some significant side effects including fever, headache, extremely painful left arm at injection site, hives that the injection site that lasted approximately 4 hours and were resolved with Benadryl and ibuprofen., nausea and significant fatigue.  The pain in the arm after injection was not at the injection site but several inches below the injection site.  On 01/13/21 I developed a raised, red, painful rash below the injection site on the left arm but at the site where the severe pain was.  This is also being investigated by Infectious Disease.

On 1/3/2021 it was discovered that had &#34;massive lymph node enlargement&#34; in my right axillary and breast region. At 32 years old, everyone took this very seriously and I started a FULL work up after being told &#34;this is acting like either breast cancer or lymphoma&#34;.

At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

                                                Patient had her first Moderna COVID vaccination at 4:00 PM today and 5 min later felt dizziness, worsening, associated with headache, nausea, sore throat, hot flashes, and dizziness is from side to side when she looks at her phone, no dizziness when she does not look at it. Patient primary complaint is headache on bilateral temples. All other symptoms resolved, and no dizziness if not looking at phone.  Patient has history of headaches, similar in quality, but this is more intense (6/10 intensity, less than her scoliosis pains, but more than usual headache pain), but otherwise the same, pounding sensation, and she can feel throbbing. Headache is about the same currently. Started simultaneously as dizziness, immediately, unchanged. No changes in vision. Peak intensity of headache around 30 min after onset, peak at 4:30 or so.  Patient notified the vaccine clinic staff and was instructed to be observed in another area, and did not improve. Patient remembered that her initial blood pressure was low and it fluctuated. Patient was then sent to the ED.  Upon initial assessment in the Emergency Department 2 hours after her initial injection, the assessment is likely vasovagal near syncope with tension headache, rather than true allergic reaction. Given metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, normal saline, and obtained labs.

Shortly after that shot i had a sore arm and left armpit lymph nodes for a few days. I noticed yesterday, a week after the shot, the lymph nodes were still a little sore. Then yesterday afternoon, my left shoulder started itching like crazy at the injection site, lasting for a couple hours. I looked and it was red where it itched, like three splotches the size of quarters but not very defined. This morning it is red over a larger swath, like a palm and a half on my shoulder. Feels sore and slightly hard under the skin, rather than itchy.

Continued though out night. Sunday - same symptoms but less painful (rate it around a 9/10) - went to store to get groceries with husband around 8:30pm and almost passed out, super weak and felt like puking - not sure if it was just the mask making it hard to breathe.

                                                Face swelling and redness with lip tingling and tongue tingling later after eating a few bites of a home prepared meal that has been eaten several times before. Started eating around 7 pm, have picture of red and swelling face at 7:11 pm. Contents of meal were shrimp, homemade egg noodles, chicken stock, pork, and romaine.  No breathing problems and felt fine besides face warm ness and some anxiety over possibly developing a new allergy, as these symptoms were similar to my adult onset allergies to oysters in 2011. Sought remote care at 7:41, spoke to RN over phone who recommended a video visit, then after video visit was recommended to go to urgent care. Arrived at Urgent Care around 8:50 PM.   Had a steroid shot of solumedrol 125 mg to IM the left arm around 9 pm, then took some Benadryl and famotidine at urgent care. Picked up prescriptions for famotidine 7 days, prednisone 4 days, and Benadryl as needed.  Taking medications now with careful watching of potentially allergic reaction provoking foods such as shrimp, fish, nuts, and wheat.

There is no soreness or tenderness when touched. The rash first appeared this morning.  I am closely watching it to see if it spreads or goes away.   My left arm was sore after receiving the vaccine but the soreness decreased each day and was gone by the 3rd day after receiving the vaccine. I expected something like that to happen.  I did not expect to see a rash a week after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Patient developed red pinpoint rash all over arms, feet, trunk within 15 minutes of vaccine which eventually spread from trunk up abdomen to chest and neck. Patient vitals remained stable and had no problem breathing but rash spread and injection site was itchy.  Patient was given benadryl cream at injection site and as rash spread, was given 25 mg oral benadryl.  After 30 min observation, no change in symptoms. Rash did stop spreading, remained constant over arms, hands, chest and abdomen, flank, and feet.  Did not extend to legs.

Checked my heart rate with a pulse ox and it was in the 150?s.

I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

I took Ibruprofen that evening and when I woke up the next morning I had a low grade fever of 99.5, I took Ibruprofen that morning and began sweating. I was sweaty/clammy all day, had a headache and tired. Around 4pm I took a 1.5 hour nap and felt better after that. The next morning I believe I had another low grade fever because I was really cold when I went to sleep, but woke up sweating. After that I have not had any symptoms.

Woke up Jan 4th at 2:13am feeling the place of injection swollen, itchy and with a single hive like a bug bite, felt another on torso on the right side. Felt rapid pulse, got up to check the mirror, eyes swollen and itchy, tongue beginning to swell. Within minutes, started feeling itchy all over my body, specially mucosae, and scalp. Took 360mg of fexofenadine and 20mg famotidine, reaction started to subside. Was up monitoring until 3:45am. Still feeling itchy but significantly less at the before medication. Plan to continue with 180mg fexofenadine a day until all itchiness goes away.

The sight of where the vaccine was administered was red and very swollen. there is a noticeable lifted knot on my arm the size of a gold ball. the sight around the area of administration is red, and sore and warm to touch. the tingling feeling also was present when waking up on Jan 5, 2021.  around 230 pm, my arm still very sore and the knot on my arm is still visible and sore to touch. the tingling feeling slowly starting to subside.

                                                On 1/7/21 I noticed a slightly enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node. There was a small amount of edema in the area surrounding it. I applied heat to it and this seemed to relieve some of the swelling. Around noon on 1/8/21 the lymph node and the tissue sounding it had approximately doubled in size from the night before. I went to my local urgent care center. The doctor seemed to think that there is a very high probability that it is my body reacting to the vaccine, especially since I still currently have a visible bruise on my arm from the injection.  The injection was on the same side as the swelling. She couldn&#39;t confirm that it is a reaction with 100% certainty, I was prescribed Keflex 500mg tabs TID for a week just in case there is an infection present.  I am supposed to monitor the size of the swelling and follow up with a PCP.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

These symptoms resolved after a day, but I have had a poorly delineated area of erythema, warmth, edema and pruritus at the injection site that began on day two post-vaccine and has been increasing in size until today (day 5 post-vaccination). Started as a small (2 cmx2cm) wheal, now  appears as painful/itching and warm blanching urticaria that takes up the entire width of my upper arm and half the length of the upper arm.

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

                                                I received my first dose of the moderna vaccine. About 10 minutes after the 15 minute observation period, I began to feel tingling and  pins and needle like sensation throughout my bilateral arms to hands. Also an itchy throat for 5-10 mins that resolved. Throughout the day the pins and needles seemed to be more generalized from my head,  torso to legs and feet. I continued to feel this through the night. I again continue to feel the generalized pins and needles the next day after my injection.  I didn?t think much of it until researching  that this may be considered a ?serious adverse effect?. I would like further direction if it is safe to go ahead with my second dose next month.

Jan 1-2, 2021 Headache, loose stool Jan 3, 2021 I woke up with a red, warm, itchy, rash at vaccine injection site on right arm. The rest was the size of a baseball. The rash was painful to the touch. Jan 4, 2021 The rash turned hard like cellulitis and was not as red. Still warm to the touch and itchy.  Jan 5-7, 2021 The right arm rash seemed to be improving, it was not as red and the hardness went away. There were little red dots in a ring where the circle of the rash had been.  Jan 8-10, 2021 I developed an itch over my entire body, it would not stop itching. My right arm starts to get the red itchy rash back when I workout or walk my dog, any time I get my heart rate up. I have to take Benadryl to help the itching go down.   Jan 11-12, 2021 My body is still itchy all over. When I exercise, my right arm gets red and itchy. My neck, throat, face, lips, and ears start to develop red hive-like blotches and they are itchy 20 minutes into my workout. This improves when I am done with my workout.  Jan 13-14, 2021 My face had a red rash over the nose and cheeks. This rash is sensitive to the touch. Jan 15 - Today Jan 16, 2021 The itch is very faint now. The red rash on my face is improving. Otherwise I feel normal.

I also had some tenderness in my underarm which I blame on a lymph node but was  never able to feel a swollen one there. Both my underarm and collarbone area remained tender/sore for about two weeks. No systemic symptoms.

                                                1 week after my injection I developed a approximate baseball size circle at my injection sight with mild warmth and tenderness and swelling. I had axillary lymph node swelling, neck muscle soreness, fatigue, and frontal and temporal headache. I still have a red circular area at my injection sight but it is gradually improving (4 days out from redness occurring). The symptoms seemed worse than the initial reaction the first few days after my injection. I am a health care provider and have taken photos daily but have not gone for an office visit at this time.

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

                                                Had normal reactions after the vaccine - swelling, itching, redness, and a knot.  It seemed to go away over about 7 days following the shot.  On day 8, it was itchy.  Then, it felt that the knot had enlarged.  It became warm to touch and a little red (not much).  It is not painful like it was after the injection.  It has not resolved, but it just started yesterday.  It is less red today, but it is about the same.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

Disappeared on Sunday and then on Tuesday it returned large, red and hot. Went to the doctor to  be treated and they said I have cellulitis. As the cellulitis my body became itchy. Continued itching all over body while taking the antibiotic, unsure why I am very itchy. The redness is gone from the infection site and now I am experiencing itching on legs, arms, back.

                                                Shot was administered on 1/20/2021. By that Friday, my upper right arm (over my bicep) developed a red patch, which I had attributed to dermatographia.  Over the weekend, it began to raise up a bit from my skin and swell, and became warm to the touch. By Monday, 1/24/2021, the swelling had stopped, but the redness was noticeable on other parts of my upper arm, but not around the shot location. There is a bruise there from the shot, but no redness. The redness and warmth changes throughout the day, and at times is &#34;itchy below the skin&#39;s surface&#34;, where I&#39;m not able to scratch.

                                                Around dinner time I developed fatigue and significant arm pain. By 10pm I had a 101 degree fever, cold sweats, chills, full body aches, and nausea. My fever reduced to 99 degrees around 0730am and remained as such through the following day (1/28/21) as the chills, nausea, and cold sweats gradually faded away. I was deeply fatigued and unable to work.  Sometime mid afternoon I developed a crippling frontal headache That worsened in the light and standing. I have no history of headaches or migraines. I was still repulsed by the thought of eating. I took acetaminophen with a protein shake and it helped the headache And residual body aches enough for me to sleep. 1/29/21 I awoke still fatigued  with a minor headache.   I am a pro athlete with no underlying conditions. I have had my flu shot yearly with no side effects. I am extremely fit and eat a healthy balanced diet, maintain a healthy athletic weight, sleep 7-8 hours a night, do not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use recreational drugs. I was absolutely floored at how sick this shot made me.

                                                Nine days after receiving the vaccine I developed rashes on my elbows, knees, and ankles and in my joints. Wrse though, was the inability to bend my fingers after they swelled up and had incredibly itchy welts all over. Benadryl did not help0, the itching, soreness, and inability to bend my fingers persisted for approximately 4 days. I had a headache that was severe as well. I made two trips to the emergency room and then followed up with my primary physician.

                                                Received first dose on 1/8/21 and second dose on 2/5/21. Mild side effects after first dose (soreness in arm).  During 1st 24 hours of having the 2nd dose I had chills, fever, body aches, sleeplessness. Symptoms subsided within 24-48 hours with the arm soreness taking about a week to completely go away.   A week and a half after receiving the 2nd dose I noticed a lump on my neck, lower middle near the collarbone. It is significantly pronounced. I saw my primary doctor for an already scheduled physical and she said I was fighting off an infection and it was normal. I mentioned I had the COVID vaccine and she said it isn&#39;t uncommon to see the lymph node swell after vaccination and it should go away in a couple of weeks. I wanted to report this because it can freak people out to see a lump in their neck so long after being vaccinated without any other symptoms. We need to list this as a possible side effect on the vaccine information. I feel completely fine except my neck is a little tender/sore from the swollen lymph node.

Took symbicort (I have normally well controlled asthma). Called clinic and was advised that I was fine and could continue to work and to follow up with MD if symptoms got worse. Did virtual visit with Pulmonologist at 0945 and he advised me to get COVID swabbed and prescribed prednisone taper and albuterol MDI. COVID swabbed 2/9 at 5pm. Out of work 2/10 &amp; 2/11 awaiting test results. Returned to work 2/12 after negative COVID result- passed safepass- worked, still SOB, but manageable. 2/13-2/14 had increasing SOB- albuterol MDI 6x/day. Monday 2/15 returned to work- saw doctor in person- increased prednisone from 20mg (tapered down) to 40mg (original dose) and added Spiriva. 2/17- Went to ED for status asthmaticus after using albuterol MDI 5-6x/day without any relief. Admitted 2/17 for asthma exacerbation- discharged 2/20. Discharged home with nebulized albuterol, prednisone slow taper, symbicort, Spiriva, Singulair &amp; Claritin. 2/23-2/24 Albuterol nebs 5x/day, still SOB. Pulmonary visit 2/24 - added inhaled budesonide nebs. Out of work 2/25-2/26. Returned to work 3/1- finally feeling better!

I felt a pounding in my chest. It felt difficult to talk to due tingling of the tongue.  I took Benadryl 25 mg PO 30 minutes prior to vaccine due to history of anaphylaxis with shell fish.

I DID NOT WAKE BACK UP FOR 17 HOURS.  1/1/2021, 9:00AM: WHEN I WOKE UP I HAD A LARGE RED RASH OVER MY FACE AND DOWN MY NECK- NO WHERE ELSE ON MY BODY BESIDES MY FACE. MY FACE HAD A BURNING SENSATION AS IF IT WERE ON FIRE.  1/2/2021: BY 48 HOURS MY ENTIRE FACE  (INCLUDING MY EYELIDS) HAD THE RED RASH. I TOOK BENADRYL AND THE BURNING SENSATION WENT AWAY BY THE MORNING.  1/3/2021: ON DAY #3 I USED A POISON IVY TYPE CREAM BEFORE BED, AS WELL AS BENADRYL. 1/4/2021, 05:00:  THE MORNING OF DAY#4 THE REDNESS AND RASH HAD SUBSIDED TREMENDOUSLY, HOWEVER STILL PRESENT. 1/4/2021, 1:30PM: VISITED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. I HAD A STEROID SHOT ADMINISTERED, AND WAS SENT A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN EPI PEN AND A &#34;PACK&#34; TO MY PHARMACY.  THE PHYSICIAN REACHED OUT TO OTHER COLLEGUES, ALL STATING THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF CASES ARISING WITH RED RASHES ON PEOPLES FACES, BUT NONE OF THEM HAD PERSONALLY SEEN IT YET. MY PHYSICIAN SAID I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO COME IN. I ASKED ABOUT MY DERMA- FILLERS, AND IF THEY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RASH BUT NOTHING COULD BE CONFIRMED. MY TEMPERATURE WAS EXACTLY 98.5, HOWEVER THE DR STATED MY SKIN WAS HOT TO THE TOUCH.

                                                I received the vaccine on December 29th, 2020. The vaccinated arm didn&#39;t really hurt until the next morning when I woke up I could barely move my arm.  Around 10:00am  I started getting chills and having sweats. Over the next hour I became severely fatigued even with taking my adderall that morning. My body started tingling, I felt dissociated, had a headache, and a little light headed. Almost a little drunk feeling. I went home from work and slept most of the day.  When I woke up in the evening around 9pm I was sweaty, and my muscles and joints hurt. I took my temperature and it was  100.6.  The next morning on December 31st I no longer had a fever. My temperature was 98. something. The next several days and even now I continue to feel severely fatigued, and slightly dissociated. However, each day I seem to feel the side effects a little less.

Next day, 1/6, she called work to say she had chills and headache and would not be reporting to work.  At 2:00 pm, she felt her heart racing, and noticed face and lip swelling and tightness in her throat.  She called her PMD who directed her to go to urgent care.  At urgent care, she got an EKG, IV fluids, IV steroids, and IV antihistamine.  Symptoms resolved within 2 hours.

                                                Sore arm, body aches after day 2 of getting vaccinated, which was to be expected. I was concerned about last night on 1/6/21, where my L arm became extremely itchy, swollen and broke out in hives. Today, remains extremely itchy, swollen/raised and there is a red square over the injection site. The area of redness and swelling measures to be 3 inches by 3 1/2 inches and does not appear to be getting any larger as the day goes on. I did take 12.5 mg of benadryl, which has resolved some of the itching.

                                                G3P1010, currently pregnant at 9 weeks. Vaccine was administered at 9 1/7 weeks. Due date is 8/9/2021. Had normal arm soreness starting about 4 hours after received the vaccine, limited to deltoid region of left arm, plus some mild fatigue. Soreness was significantly better by about 30 hours post-vaccine, and gone by 48 hours.  On 1/6/2021, one week after receiving the vaccine, I started to develop itching in my left arm around the vaccine site. By 1/7/2021, there was erythema, mild edema, ongoing pruritus and felt warm to the touch. Today, 1/8/2021, all symptoms are gone.

                                                On Sunday, January 3rd, I woke up to find a rash about 3 inches long, starting at the vaccination site. By Tuesday it had widened. I have photos of both Sunday and Tuesday?s rash, if you would like me to forward those to you. Wednesday night the rash had lightened in color, it was mostly just the outline, but had grown larger than my hand. It crept up towards my shoulder, underarm, and about half way down to my elbow.   Thursday morning (yesterday) I called medical provider to make a Virtual Visit at 5:30pm same day. APRN, called me at about 12:20pm and told me to go to the ER right away. My throat felt swollen and constricted at the time, though I was able to breathe, drink and eat. Swallowing was a bit difficult.  I was seen by PA, at the ER at MC. She evaluated me and said the reaction was bad, but not severe, and on the mend. She prescribed oral prednisone 20mg for the next five days. I did not need any steroid or Benadryl shots. She also said she feels comfortable with me getting the second COVID-19 vaccination, which is scheduled for 1/25.

My right cheek felt a little numb and I felt like there was a bit of a lump in my throat. The cheek and throat sensation went away in just a few minutes after I noticed them at first, did not persist. The redness on my face and ears went away, but returned on a smaller area later in the afternoon, then went away and have not returned either in the 3 days since I&#39;ve had it.

                                                Arm was bruised and tender to the touch approximately 3-4 hours following vaccine. Started feeling dizzy around 8pm on 1/7/21.  Took PM meds and went to bed. Awoke around 3am with a temp of 103, joint aches, muscle aches, chills, congestion, eyes very dry and itchy,  severe headache/migraine with photosensitivity, fatigue on 1/8/21. Left arm was swollen, hot to the touch and very tender to move it. Took Tylenol and Benadryl to help relieve symptoms. Put a heating pad on injection site. Felt about the same all day so I rested. Went to bed around 10pm on 1/8/21. Woke up around 4am on 1/9/21 and my temp was 99.7 prior to taking any meds and after about 20 minutes of being out of bed. On 1/9/21 I still have arm tenderness and bruising, fatigue, headache, left eye redness to upper eyelid with swelling, temp has been running at 99.7 and it?s currently 4pm EST.

                                                5 days after my vaccination I woke up in the middle of the night to pain in my arm pit of the arm the vaccine was administered. My lymph nodes in my groin, neck, clavicle, and arm pit are visibly inflamed. The left side of my face and neck are swollen as well. I am having tingling and numbness down my left arm and in my fingers. I am feeling very light headed and short of breath.

                                                on Wed 1/6/21 I had an allergic reaction and am unsure what set it off.  My eyes became itchy, watery and my corneas swelled.  I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

                                                Self-reporting as pharmacist and patient. After Moderna vaccine, injection site reactions developed for 48 hrs following administration (moderate pain, swelling, warmth to touch). Injection pain then subsided. At 10 days after injection, large swollen lymph node under arm on injection side was noticed. The swelling of lymph node seems slightly diminished today (day 14 post injection #1). In conjunction with swollen lymph node, experiencing generalized malaise, fatigue, and neck lymph nodes seem slightly swollen. Routinely taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen for some symptomatic relief.

                                                7 days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna Covid19 vaccine, I experienced a quarter sized rash just left of the injection site on my left arm. The rash was red, circular, slightly raised and was itchy. By the next day, the rash had grown in size to about 5 inches long by 3 inches wide, in a more oval shape and continued to itch. By the third day, the rash size was consistent with the day before except that it no longer itched. Today (1/20), the redness remains and the size remains consistent, still does not itch.

I received solu-medrol, Benadryl, antacid, and anti-nausea. They took blood tests, urinalysis, and chest x-ray, all of which were normal. I did not have a rash around the injection site this time. I was discharged at about 3:10pm

                                                I was experiencing what I understand to be one of the more common side effects: pain at injection site. This pain kind of traveled to other parts of my arm and eventually my arm pit. I noticed the pain travelling around the date of 1/2/2021, and by 1/6/2021 it getting more intense. As I was trying to massage out the soreness, I noticed a palpable, painful lump in my right breast. I did not immediately recognize it as a swollen lymph node at that time, but after several Dr exams, and the lump and pain decreasing, I believe that is what was happening. I do still have the lump, and it is tender, so I am currently monitoring it.

                                                Initially, arm was sore and inflamed for about 4 days. I did not notice condition afterwards because pain had subsided. Approximately 8 days after shot, arm started to itch and I examined further. It was still very red and inflamed with knots under the skin. An area approximately 2&#34; x6&#34;. I started to keep a closer eye on it and when it was not better the next day, I contacted my doctors office in the building where I received the shot. The nurse who responded had me photograph it and continue to monitor until the doctor could look at it on Monday (this being Friday afternoon). Friday evening I outlined the affected area with marker to see if it was worsening or maintaining the same level. By Saturday morning it had grown outside the marked line by about an inch, was warm to the touch, and was starting to hurt. I decided to not wait until Monday and called an urgent care to go doctor to look at. They examined and read temperature (head was 97.2, arm was 99.5). After consideration the doctor advised me to take benadryl that evening to see if it had any effect. If not I was presribed Cefdinir 300mg antibiotic to take in the morning. Benadryl did nothing so I started taking the antibiotic and noticed marked improvement by day 2. Site is mostly gone now (4 days into 10 day antibiotic cycle).

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine Approximately 3.5 hours after receiving the vaccine, I developed hives on my right arm and the area around both eyes began to swell and itch.  At which point I took 25mg of Benadryl. The hives subsided after 2 hours of onset. Swelling around the eyes and itchiness persisted through the next day; although symptoms were not as severe as the night prior.  The morning of January 15th, I developed redness, swelling , and warmth at the injection site. Symptoms were not present prior to the morning of January 15th. The area of the injection felt hard underneath the skin. I was evaluated by a physician and treated for cellulitis with antibiotics. Symptoms resolved with antibiotic course.

My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

I stayed in an observation room for about 3 hours. Next day, I couldn&#39;t feel my right arm. I started getting fever, chills. I had all symptoms of the coronavirus. Saturday at 03:00 am - I woke up and I couldn&#39;t feel my arm or my fingers on my right side. I called the Emergency number. I stayed home and took Tylenol. Couldn&#39;t feel my arm at all that Saturday - dead. Sunday - same thing. Monday morning, I woke up, I could feel a little bit of my fingers but I noticed that I had blisters full of blood between your index finger and your thumb. I didn&#39;t go to work that day. The doctor wrote me out of work for the rest of the week. I didn&#39;t have any sensation on my pinkie or ring finger. I had a little bit of sensation on the rest of my fingers. I stayed at home and I didn&#39;t do anything with my arm and it slowly started getting better. That whole week I was having symptoms that were just like coronavirus. They came and went. the following Saturday, I started being able to move my arm around and doing more stuff and slowly it came back but I&#39;m not 100%. I can&#39;t lay on the right hand side too long - it starts feeling like my arm is asleep. I got the second dose February 12th.  I spoke to an allergy doctor and an anesthesiology doctor (video and telephone visits) - they told me I was having common side affects that people were having from the vaccine but they didn&#39;t know why.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

At 12:05pm, pt got itching in her throat and 25mg of benadryl was given. At 12:08pm, another 25mg of benadryl was given based on weight-based dosing. Pt is drowsy and we recommended that she does not return to work b/c she was given 50mg benadryl. After 40 minutes, pt very drowsy but still has itchy throat, seems to be better. However, after the flu shot, her throat was itchy for the whole day after given 50mg benadryl. Consulted Dr who recommended we observe her for a total of 2 hours. Advised her to get an allergy consult since she has had this reaction to 2 vaccines and that she does not receive the 2nd dose of COVID vaccine unless advised by allergist. Pt verbalized understanding that she will not receive 2nd dose unless advised by allergist. Pt left at 1:35pm as she had sick child at home. Pt understands to seek medical attention if symptoms worsen. No additional reactions noted in EMR

                                                12 days following the vaccine administration I noticed redness on my arm around the injection site. This redness was hot to the touch and rather large, exceeding the deltoid muscle and going down into my bicep. I also felt radiating soreness into my armpit and left breast.  The following day the rash had grown in size and felt hot to the touch on my entire upper arm with swelling and edema that affected the movement of my arm and hand. Continued soreness and pain in my armpit, left breast and down my arm into my fingers and up into my neck.  I proceeded to go to the urgent care as directed by Clinic employee health and my PCP. There was I was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescriped Keflex for 7 days, 3x a day.  It has been recommended that I seek further medical care due to my reaction, but this has yet to be scheduled.

Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

                                                Initially had a typical injection site reaction the day of the shot (about 4 hours later). This included a round circle of redness and swelling around the injection site, along with pain and warmth. This subsided, fading to a bruise and pain went away. On the morning of Day 7 after vaccination my injection site became very itchy and progressively red throughout the day. On the morning of Day 8 I woke up to my injection site being very swollen and bright red. My entire arm is swollen, up into my face. My arm is extremely hot. The itching is better but painful now.

My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

Lasted approximately 3 days then resolved. 1/1/2021-In the morning noted hives/rash/itching/obvious line of demarcation to the injection site in my left shoulder.  Through the morning noted the hives spread up my neck and angioedema noted to both sides of my neck, lymph nodes swelling on both sides and the injection site became more swollen and turned very hard to the touch.  No difficulty breathing at baseline, but it becamer difficult to take a full breath and chest tightness with exertion.  Benadryl 50 mg was taken 4-6 times a day for 3 days.  PA consulted, who stated to stay with Benadryl regimen, steroids not currently recommended, call 911 if symptom worsen.

                                                A little over 2 days after the vaccine, I had a horrible headache. Thought nothing of it, took Excederin migraine and went to bed. Woke up Thursday feeling fine, then by 5 pm, was very run down, had a mild headache, and had an intense sinus pressure under my eyes. My neck hurt and was sore to the touch in the front. When I bent over, it felt like my head was going to explode from pressure. No other symptoms or anything to be alert about. Took a Mucinex before bed, hoping that it would move anything that might be clogging my sinuses, went to sleep. Woke up Friday feeling okay, with just a tiny remnant of a headache. Around 1 pm, intense sinus pressure returned, worse than the previous day. Decided to go to local healthcare clinic around 3:30 pm. PA looked at ears, throat, all looked okay. Only symptom was swollen lymph nodes in neck, same side as the vaccine was administered. Covid tested (subsequent results were negative). Saturday, had less pressure, and spent the day laying around. By Sunday, was feeling back to normal. Peak of incident was definitely Friday.

Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                On 01/12/2021, I was notified that the patient stated she had a rash on her left arm near the immunization site.  I examined this site on 01/12/2021.  Noted 2 in diameter area where vaccine was injected, that showed a faded induration, but no redness now. The patient states this was red at the site for several days but then faded to the current appearance.  She states one week after administration of the vaccine, she developed a rash trailing to inner aspect of her left arm. Rash was blotchy in appearance, in small clusters. No induration or erythema noted.  Patient reports mild pruritis. States she has been taking her allegra since the immunization, has not taken any benadryl or other new medications for this rash.  Denies any systemic systemic symptoms. No shortness of breath, angioedema, wheezing, chest pain, or GI/GU symptoms.  She states earlier in the day on 01/12/2021, she had site examined by her primary care provider, PA and was told to put hydrocortisone cream on site and to monitor.   Patient denies taking any new medications since vaccine administration.  On 01/13/2021, patient was examined by another provider at clinic, APRN.  She noted, the arm is erythematous, mildly raised and with no induration or fluctuance at site. The patient complains of slight burning and significant pruritus. There are no excoriations. She has been using hydrocortisone and taking claritin. She encouraged patient to start taking benadryl as directed and continue hydrocortisone. Edges of erythema were marked and advised patient to monitor for progression today. If progression occurred within a few hours she planned to send RX for treatment of acute delayed reaction to vaccine.  Patient was examined at 3:18PM by RN and she reported that it looked like the erythema had improved and had gotten smaller, it had not progressed beyond the pen markings. Pt complains of some itching still but had not been able to take benadryl yet today. She will keep an eye on it and will check back in with us tomorrow.

My axillary lymph nodes were very swollen and painful. I also had a headache and felt a lot of fatigue and body aches.  I also had some paresthesia in my hand that would come and go randomly.

                                                On 1/8/21 evening (around 6 PM), I began to notice a few small (less than 4 inches in diameter), patchy, red, warm, raised, itchy spots on my posterior neck, abdomen, and left arm. By 9 PM, I had itchy redness across my entire chest. I went to sleep. The next morning, it had seemed to clear up slightly. By 4-6 PM 1/9/21, the rash had increased to cover my entire abdomen, with itchiness and redness. I contacted my supervisor at the hospital and also utilized telehealth to discuss the situation with a physician. He advised me to take Benadryl and issued a prescription for prednisone to clear the rash. He also advised me to take an allergy medication such as Claritin the next morning. I took Benadryl and although the redness stayed, the itchy sensation greatly decreased. I went to sleep roughly 3-4 hours after Benadryl administration (around 11-12 PM). I also went to the hospital for a COVID-19 test that evening on the recommendation of my employer. at 1:30 AM on 1/10/21, I woke to find the rash had covered 90 percent of my body (every part of me except for my face) and I was exceedingly itchy. I took an additional dose of Benadryl and fell back asleep. I woke at 8:30 AM 1/10/21 and the rash was entirely gone. I felt slightly itchy, so I took one additional dose of Benadryl. I have not had any additional doses of Benadryl, redness/rash, or itchiness since that time. I have overall felt well otherwise. I have not had a fever, cough, or shortness of breath. I have perhaps been slightly more tired than usual. I received notification of a negative COVID-19 test at 9:30 PM on 1/11/21. I returned to work the next day. I saw my family practitioner on 1/13/21 just to discuss her thoughts on what had happened (again, at this point I had no rash) and she advised I report my situation to VAERS.

The following morning noticed a small red raised area immediately below the injection site that was warm to the touch and very tender. The area grew larger over the course of a couple days. At around day 5 post vaccine, the area began to itch. At day 8, it is still red, warm to touch and itchy. No treatment has been used.

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

Initially had minor swelling and redness at injection site with minor pain, similar to flu shot, which lasted approximately 48 hours. 48 hours after injection, had chills with no fever for approximately one hour. After that symptom, no concerning symptoms occurred until evening of 1/18/21. Redness, swelling, and itchiness approximately the size of a quarter began. Morning of 1/19/21, size of redness and swelling had increased to size of baseball with itching. Evening of 1/19/21, size had increased to softball with continued itching. Area was raised, hard, and warm. Morning of 1/20/21, area had grown further and was starting to wrap around sides of arm and have ?target? appearance. Saw PCP due to concerns of size growth and itching with no relief from hydrocortisone cream. Recommended use of Zyrtec with hydrocortisone cream and cold compress. Recommended reporting to VAERS.

OB office was contacted about reaction and they will continue to monitor during my pregnancy but as of now no signs of harm.  Adverse reaction started with minor muscle aches  then about 12hr after I started with a fever/ chills that got very severe during the night. Finally around 1am/2am the fever started to break.  I took Tyenol 500mg every 4 to 6 hours x 5 doses in the 24hr period.

                                                Shortly after receiving the second dose Moderna vaccine, patient experienced nausea and dizziness.  Her vitals were stable.  She was alert and oriented but appeared to be weak and mildly uncomfortable.  She was observed for almost 30 minutes with resolution of the nausea but remained weak, dizzy and then started to c/o of facial numbness &#34;like I got novocaine.&#34;  She stated it was her whole face including lips and tongue.  She remained alert talking in full sentences.  &#43;facial symmetry, no obvious facial or tongue swelling.  Vitals remained stable.  At that time it was decided to transport her to the ED for continued evaluation.  She was brought from the outpatient vaccine clinic to the ED via wheelchair without incident.

Normal treatment that works for me( rizatroban) only slightly lessened. Advil Tylenol alternated for migraine and chills. Arm much less sore this time. I would say normal injection soreness.  But stayed in bed all day due to migraine, chills and fatigue. No way I could have worked. 36hrs- woke up feeling really foggy and some dizziness.  After drinking a few glasses of water feeling somewhat normal.  No fatigue today, arm feeling almost normal.

                                                On day10, 01/22/2021 about 3pm I went to touch my arm and it felt sore. When I got home from work, I noticed what looked like 3 round/oval shaped redness and swelling spots that were warm to touch on my arm, I applied Benadryl cream and that helped decrease. The next day the three spots had became one and was the size of a tennis ball; it was red, a little swollen and warm to touch. The following day (today 01/24/2021) the the redness and swelling had grown about 6 inches wide and 5 inches in height; I took Benadryl 25 mg po and within 30 minutes then swelling and redness had began to decrease, warm to touch was still there and it began to get a little itchy but very manageable, I applied benadryl cream and that seemed to help a little, but when cream wore off it began to get a little itchy, but still very manageable; I did not reapply the cream.  No pain or discomfort at the area of concern on any days above.

Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

Chills, muscle aches, headache and fatigue began about 14 hrs after injection and continued for about 24 hrs. Headache  and fatigue continued on for 48hrs. Diarrhea probably started about 18 hrs after injection and was very mild throughout the next day. Enlarged lymph node didn&#39;t start until around 38 hrs later and although it has reduced significantly it is still a bit enlarged.

When I got up the next morning at 6am, I realized I had mastitis on my right breast ( I got the vaccine in my left arm.) The mastitis consisted of redness around the areola, pain, swelling, and my lymph node in my right armpit felt slightly enlarged and painful. My fever was 100.9

My fever peaked at 101.2 at 2am. Pain relievers and fever reducers did not help. I had cold sweats throughout the night, not able to sleep consistently through the night due to body aches, headache and nausea. Left arm became swollen, hot and hard to the touch, this lasted through 2/17/21. The arm was itchy from 2/18-2/20/21. The fever and body aches lasted through 2/16 until about 10:15pm, around 11:00pm the headache went away. I was feeling mostly recovered with the exception of the arm by the morning of 2/17.

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

On 1/1/2021, I noticed that my arm was again sore; upon inspection, I found that the welt had returned. It was again large, red, swollen, hot to touch and very itchy. As of today (1/6/2021), it is just a slight bruise.

Immediately following the vaccine I had mild / moderate pain at injection site and muscle soreness at injection site. Roughly 20-24 hours after receiving  the vaccine, I developed moderate headache, fatigue, fogginess, full body aches, nausea and upset stomach. I continued on Tylenol twice daily. After a good night?s sleep, I felt better the following morning and all symptoms had resolved within 48 hours post vaccination.

I went to my gynecologist , first thinking I may have a yeast infection but she did not see a rash and couldn&#39;t diagnose me. She told me that my pain was probably neurological. She took my blood and sent it to a lab for possible yeast infection and STDs. She prescribed me Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Diporopionate 1%. I went to my PCP on Wednesday because the burning intensified and I thought that I may have shingles. I have a stuffy nose and my sense of smell isn&#39;t very good right now. My PCP gave me a Covid test and told me that she can not test me for shingles because I do not have a rash. She did prescribed me Gabapentin 100mg . I am awaiting Covid test and Lab results

                                                Upon vaccination, I had mild soreness in my right arm muscle on day 1 and day 2 (I have been reporting to the VSafe app). There were NO other symptoms or side effects including NO redness, lump/swelling, itching, etc.  I felt fine. I woke up Wednesday, January 6th at 8am  to some itching on my injection site. When lifting my shirt to look at it, I found a quarter sized, red swollen lump that was a little sore and hot to touch.  I contacted my hospital employee COVID phone hotline and spoke with a nurse who transferred me to a doctor (11am) I sent a photo and described my arm. Dr. stated that it was unlikely an allergic reaction due to it being 1 week later. She diagnosed me with cellulitis and started me on Bactrim antibiotic. I took my first dose at 8pm on 1/6 and at 2:30am I woke up with stomach cramps and diarrhea. I woke up again on 1/7 with an elevated temperature at 99 and feeling nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, slight body aches and a large, red hot touch spot on my left ankle (I had a spider bite on my left ankle in Sept 2020 that was treated with Bactrim it healed no issues but this flare up occurred same spot). I continued to take the Bactrim (3 pills total since receiving the rx) and still felt sick. I spoke again with a new COVID hotline doctor on the phone APRN CNP who stated she believes I in fact do not have cellutitis but rather an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine and therefore I should cease taking the Bactrim and start Benadryl. I did that at 7pm 1/7 went to bed woke up and my ankle was better as was my arm although you can still see the circle. I followed up on 1/8 with APRN CNP via secure messaging with photos and she stated again I likely am allergic and to monitor.

She stated that she was back to her baseline before leaving.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after injection I started driving home. I began to feel like my mind was foggy and some fatigue, then my lower lip and tongue started to tingle. I stopped driving and waited to see if anything further developed. I then felt flush and my hands became clammy. After maybe 2 minutes these symptoms resolved, I never had any trouble breathing so I continued home and did not seek any medical attention. The whole time frame was about 5 to 10 minutes.

                                                At the time of injection no issues other than sore arm. Day 9 post injection developed significant swelling, redness, warmth, and rash like irritation in left arm. Over the past 5 days there has been some decrease in swelling but the redness has formed a circle and has flare ups of rash, warm, and irritation. I have been taking benadyl, zyrtec, and cortisone cream to try and relieve symptoms.

I woke up with adverse effects on Jan 8: itchy raised rash next to injection site; ongoing today, Jan 9: rash has flattened, but remains warm, pink &amp; itchy - appears like cellulitus. Also arm has remained slightly sore since Dec 30.

Also began experiencing  vivid nightmares. Never experienced vivid nightmares before receiving Moderna vaccine. Vivid nightmares occurring nightly and including racing heart beat, sweating, shaking and ridged muscles, taking 1-2 hours to fall back asleep, continuing to increase in intensity.

                                                At 4:30pm on Saturday January 9, 2021 I experience a slight fever with chills and back and neck pain. Nothing alarming. I was still able to carry out my normal day activities that included cleaning, tidying, cooking. I did not check my temperature because there was no need, as I said, I could carry on with my day. My arm hurt a lot that day and there was a rectangular red rash around the injection site. That was about the weirdest part at 5:15pm today (Jan 10th, 2021). I noticed this gnarly rash on my chest and back and both shoulders. Red and a little itchy, warm to the touch. It is now 11:50pm same day and the relish has spread to under both of my breasts and down to the bottom of my back. I have pictures of the rash. No fever today. Also, I am both the patient and a member of the vaccination team at my company. My coworker and I are in charge of all admin associated with the vaccine. We are currently vaccinating all our staff. I was the first to get vaccinated in our company. And here it looks like I have an allergic reaction! I have never had an allergic reaction in the past to an injection. I just took some BENADRYL. I&#39;ll show a nurse at my clinic tomorrow. Hoping it doesn&#39;t spread anymore.

Night of Day 4 and ongoing have been having feverish, sweating, and chills several times per night, which continue. Woke up on Day 7 (1/8/2021) with pain in L axilla, which continues. On Day 9, I had red, slightly itchy, rash at site of injection approx 6x5cm. Had neg rapid COVID test on Day 9 and PCR, which was negative as well. Saw my provider on Day 10 and requested labs to be checked (cbc, iron also checked as needed to follow up those incidentally). Requested an esr but provider did not think it was necessary but did encourage me to report to Health Department or Moderna but found this website instead. Please let me know if I need to notify anyone else.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

Able to do normal activities throughout the day. 01/03/2021: Woke up with left arm still feeling weird and pain in the left armpit. If I put my fingertips in the middle of my armpit it hurt, sharp pain. I could not feel any lumps. I felt 2 lymph nodes swollen: above left clavicle and bottom of left neck. The lymph node above the left clavicle hurt with pressure.  Pain in both areas subsided by 01/06/2021 evening. Lymph node swelling has gone down but I can still feel them.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine, my left arm started to itch intensely. A large single hive formed. It was inflamed &amp; felt hot to the touch. I called the pharmacy where I received it &amp; was told that?s a common thing reported. To massage the area, use hydrocortisone cream for the itching, &amp; let them know if it didn?t get better. I followed the directions &amp; added Benadryl at bedtime. The next day on Thursday  the inflammation from the hive went down, but it remained bright red &amp; felt hot to the touch. I used the cream &amp; Benadryl that night. On Friday when I woke up the redness was nearly gone, but there was still discoloration and an added reddened area on my arm near the bend of my arm. It looked like a white ring was formed around the discolored hive area. Saturday it started to itch &amp; got inflamed some more. A half circle shaped hive appeared around the original hive spot. I used hydrocortisone cream &amp; took Benadryl at bedtime. This morning when I woke up it looked like a bullseye rash like from a tick bite! It has still been itchy some &amp; others told me it feels warmer to the touch than the rest of my arm. I have taken pictures each day for documenting purposes that I can email you all. I called the pharmacist again today to let them know it had changed to look like the bullseye rash. I was asked if I have a penicillin allergy &amp; I do not. My mother does. I asked what medications are related to PCN &amp; the pharmacist named augmentin &amp; amoxicillin-I?ve had both without issues. She said there is a very rare side effect being reported in folks with a PCN allergy. She said she was puzzled by the fact my reaction was late onset &amp; suggested I report this. Also suggested to watch for fever, spreading rash, swelling of the tongue or throat, &amp; to keep using the Benadryl for now. Was also advised to seek medical help if any of those symptoms arise.

My cough got really bad and I had to start on an albuterol nebulizer because of my cough/wheezing.

I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

This spot also feels warm and the skin is slightly raised.  I drew a circle around the rash to track growth and within 10 minutes it continued to spread outside of the line by about 1/4 inch.

Did not take anything or put anything on it. Did not let her doctor know.  About 3 days later, it went away.   Got the second shot on day 28 (1/20/21).

Day 9 (1/7), noticed red rash on my bicep- probably about 50%-60% of my arm was having very red and kind of warm to the touch. It slowly got better through the week and resolved around 1/20. Can I still get second dose?

                                                Since receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020 I have been experiencing what almost feels like brain fog. I have had some trouble staying on task at work, trouble finding words, remembering common last names, etc. Oftentimes I will have this temporarily as a migraine aura, but it typically goes away once the migraine comes and goes. This seems to have come to stay since receiving the vaccine. I did have fatigue for approximately 3 days after the vaccine administration - 2-3 hour naps daily. This has improved some. I also had a dull headache that seemed to be there daily for approximately 2.5 weeks post vaccine- nothing I could not tolerate but it just did not want to go away even with my usual treatment - Excedrin Headache and ice.  The best way I can describe it is a dull pain all over the top of my head and forehead. I did have one headache that occurred approximately 5 days after the vaccine, that I would consider a &#34;bad migraine&#34; (Migraine that rendered me incapable of completing my daily routine - having to stay in bed, dizziness, etc). My face on the side with the weakness as a result of my brain tumor has also been a bit more &#34;tired&#34; than usual - facial palsy more pronounced. There have been times in my brain tumor journey where this happens for sometimes a couple of weeks at a time usually due to stress or an impending &#34;bad migraine&#34; coming on or if I have been exposed to or end up developing an illness later - but I never developed an illness an no additional stress. Facial symptoms include smile not as symmetrical (basically more assymetrical than usual - not wanting to move at all so much on the affected side) and more eye watering on the affected side. I do still feel a little lightheaded at times, but otherwise no other neurological symptoms. No upper respiratory symptoms or any other &#34;COVID-like&#34; symptoms. No nausea, vomiting, numbness, or tingling. Symptoms do seem to be improving this week.

                                                First 24 hours sore arm and felt achy and out of it. Thought I was starting to feel myself by Sunday midday but then suddenly on Sunday afternoon almost exactly 48 hours after the shot I started to feel extreme confusion and short term memory loss. My body started shaking, I felt very hot and then very cold (back and forth) and began experiencing shortness of breath. It was all very scary and I ended up in the ER.

                                                I felt a pain shoot through my arm to my hand as I was being given the shot, then my arm and shoulder were very sore. I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

                                                The next day it was extremely painful and two days later I saw it was red, inflamed, swollen and itchy. The redness spread across my arm and down and persisted for six days. Since the day I got the injection I?ve had numbness in my left hand that has never gone away. I saw my doctor on 1/27/21 and he said it was an inflamed nerve from the injection and it should go away eventually.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

                                                6 minutes after receiving vaccine patient reported that her tongue was starting to swell and that her heart was racing.  Staff called 911 immediately.  Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

Negative strep that day, negative covid test the following Monday. Resolved within 48 hours.  8 days after vaccine (2/10/21): developed rash at injection site, tenderness, swelling, and itching - right arm had very minimal, minor rash at the same time. Pain was more significant than the two days post injection and improved within 48 hours (still have itchy, dry, raised skin but minimal redness as of 2/22/21).  16 days after vaccine (2/18/21): lymph node in front of neck area by collarbone swollen. No pain but minor discomfort. It feels like a 2 inch squishy mass with a hard node in it. I&#39;ve never had swelling here before. If my other lymph nodes are swollen as well I cannot tell.  I had the flu shot at the end of December, 2020. Not sure if that was close enough to matter, no symptoms after that one.

                                                Injection site was painful to the touch and developed a red rash circle around the injection site with a radius of about 2 inches. It has remained like this for several days. Now as it appears to be going away the injection site feels as though it has caved in slightly and may leave a small scar.

                                                The vaccine was received at 1:12 PM, and I felt fairly fine, aside from injection site pain and some tingling in my left arm  until I had sudden significant elevation of heart rate, with shortness of breath, and throat swelling/tightening at approximately 1:26PM.  I cold compress was applied to my forehead and I was put in a reclining position &amp; then received Epinephrine at 1:28PM. EMS (present onsite) arrived for transport at 1:31PM. 4L of oxygen was applied after O2 sat of 89% noted by EMS. Blood pressure was elevated to &gt;200/100 initially by EMS. Symptoms improved quickly following epinephrine, with some residual feelings of very mild throat fullness, and I developed chills which improved over time.  I was transported to emergency department where I was evaluated (symptoms mostly resolved at that time, but ED physician noted a little swelling remaining in my uvula), then IV Benadryl and Decadron were given. Later acetaminophen was also given for headache that developed during my ED stay.  My vitals were monitored throughout and observation occurred until I was discharged at approximately 5:00PM, as symptoms had not recurred.

Very tired all week post vaccine,.  Day 5-6 noticed ipsilateral axillary lymph node swelling.  On day 7 post vaccine I got a localized area of itching swelling and redness as if I had been bitten by a few mosquitoes at injection site that was new. Milder on day 8, less itchy and swollen, but still red and a little raised.  Mild shortness of breath.

                                                I waited a full 30 min after my injection due to my peanut allergy.  Left hospital feeling ok- on drive home began to feel flushed in my face, tingling in my lips and began to wheeze.  It felt like my peanut allergy but on a smaller scale.  I took my Albuterol inhaler and some Benadryl once I got home and felt better.  The next day I still have some itchiness and  fullness in my throat but nothing like yesterday.

                                                At minute 12 after injection (8:31am on 1/5/20), the pruritis started on my scalp and my back. I informed the volunteer at the end of the drive line. She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it&#39;s tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event. Thanks.

                                                While waiting the 15 minutes after the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy, I thought it was just because I was nervous.  After the 15 minutes, I went outside and tood off my mask to get some fresh air.  I went back to work and was still feeling dizzy.  I drank water, ate some food and sat for a bit.  At about 1pm, I was still feeling dizzy but also started feeling off, as if I were intoxicated or like how you feel when you just wake up from having anesthesia, sluggish.  I then went home and slept for about 5 hours and now I feel much better.  Will someone let me know if it is recommended I still get the second dose next month?

                                                Patient is an employee at Health Center. She was given the vaccine approx 3:30 pm on 1/28/2021 in the left deltoid. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine without incident. The following is a written statement from patient describing events: &#34;About 30 minutes after vaccine, I felt like I had hit my elbow on something. Discomfort radiated from left elbow to wrist- I did have pain around injection site. About 8:30pm on 1/8/21, area around injection site became more painful. Gradually pain increased radiating down to finger tips and up to left side of neck, stopped right below ear. Neck and shoulder muscles felt really tight- uncomfortable ache. Also got extremely tired- left side of face felt numb- left eye slightly blurry- I fell asleep about 10pm. Woke up a few hours later drenched in sweat. Face numbness gone, eyesight normal.? Patient reports the following day 1/9/2021 @ 2pm: ?All of a sudden I started to sweat all over. I didn?t feel hot, only last about 30 minutes.? Patient reports on Sunday 1/10/2021: ?Woke up feeling okay. Left arm and neck still ached but not as bad. Got fatigued around 10am. I got a headache that became really bad. Dizzy, nauseous- no relief from OTC meds. Headache went away after a few hours.? Patient reports today 1/11/2021: ?Today I am still very tired. My left arm, fingertips, shoulders and neck still ache. Face is flushed.? Patient does state previous reactions to prior vaccines: ?TdaP about 7 years ago made me have joint pain for months. Last flu shot received was about 9 years ago, had flu like symptoms x12 hours.? Patient did not seek any medical care for the reaction described above. Patient?s PCP has been also been made aware of her reaction.

                                                On 1/12/2021 (two weeks following the injection) the injection site became hot to the touch, quite red, itchy, and slightly swollen. On the morning of 1/13/2021 I noticed that it was still swollen, hot to the touch, mildly itchy, less swollen, but now has a large red ring around the injection site with a pale center.

                                                Patient reported swelling of arm several hours after vaccination that resolved the following day after taking diphenhydramine and applying hydrocortisone. The swelling returned after 3 days and has progressively become worse since the time of vaccination. She appears to have cellulitis, and this may be a result of the vaccinator using a 1 inch needle to administer the vaccine vs. a 1&amp;1/2 inch needle. This patient&#39;s weight is greater than 200 lbs and if a 1 inch needle was used this vaccine would have been administered subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly.

                                                Reports she felt flushed about 10 minutes after she received the vaccine.  Also states she felt a little &#34;spacy&#34;.  States she was talking with the RN who gave her the shot and states &#34;I felt like she had to concentrate more to have a conversation&#34;.  She reports the flushing subsided while she was in the observation area, but still left a little spacy that night.  She was feeling back to normal this morning and able to work.   She states she was nervous going in to the appointment.  Had ate a good lunch.  Hydrated well before injection.

My provider initially treated me with Keflex and told me I had cellulitis caused by the vaccine. I took the antibiotics (500mg x 3 per day) for 5 days and the area got much worse. I went back to the doctor and was told it was actually an allergic reaction. I was treated with Prednisone and Benadryl for 7 days. The area cleared up after that treatment, but is still slightly discolored.

                                                Tachycardia, palpitations, lightheadedness/near syncope, and numbness/tingling to tongue and lips 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. All symptoms resolved in about 15 minutes with the exception of  numbness/tingling to tongue and lips which lasted 3 hours. Symptoms resolved on their own without treatment/medication other than lying flat with feet up and drinking a bottle of water. I was assessed by medical professionals at the vaccine clinic which was located inside of the hospital. I consulted with an ED physician but did not require any additional treatment.

Bull&#39;s eye Rash on the vaccine site. I have taken a photo if ever needed. 2. Swollen lymph nodes.  I wanted to emphasize on the bull&#39;s eye rash which started after 5 days after vaccination. it&#39;s itchy and swollen. No pain or other discomfort.  I never noticed lymph nodes  before the peculiar rash.  I am overall health and has no other contra indications.

                                                Woke up at 5am the following morning with slight nausea and became diaphoretic and felt faint. This only lasted a few minutes, but later in the morning around 9am, body aches, fever, chills, fatigue began and lasted until 10pm. After this time, all symptoms ceased. I also had an extremely sore deltoid where injection site occurred for 48hrs, much worse than I&#39;ve ever had for any vaccine or IM injection.

                                                I received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA on the morning of 1/14/21. The next morning when I woke up I noticed that my right jaw was sore. I thought I may have slept on it wrong during my sleep or that had chewed weird while eating the day before and didn&#39;t think much of it. Throughout the day on 1/15/21 I continued to experience more pain though. I put some heat on it and tried to massage it, but nothing really helped. I hoped it would feel better this morning( 1/16/21) when I woke up but at this point it feels about the same. It&#39;s difficult to chew and feels swollen because my mouth bite isn&#39;t fully aligned like it usually is. I took my temperature and don&#39;t have a fever. I thought I should submit this in case my jaw pain it is related to getting the vaccine. In the past (maybe a year or so ago) I did have my chiropractor do some muscle release on the right side of my jaw because it was clicking a little while I ate and he said it was TMJ. I haven&#39;t experienced that since and this does not feel like that did, nor is there any clicking. Maybe that made me or susceptible though to experience this side effect if that&#39;s what it is so wanted to include that too.

Day 3---no side effects Day 4 to Day 5---At about 8 pm, I noticed slight swelling underneath my left eye, that looked like a bag.  My face was also red.  The sides of my face, jaw line,  &amp; both sides of my neck were itchy.  I went to bed since I was supposed to work the next morning at 6 AM (OB Nurse).  I work up at 4:15 AM &amp; my face was quite swollen, specifically my left side, my face &amp; neck was warm to the touch &amp;  itchy.  I immediately took 50mg of Benadryl &amp; called my internal medicine doctor. Day 5---I was to be seen in the clinic at 7:00 AM.  The Benadryl helped some.  I was not having any breathing difficulty.  I was prescribed 5 days of Prednisone.  By about 1:00 PM,  the swelling was worsening &amp; my lips were tingling.  I called the doctor again &amp; they told me to go to the ER.  I never had issues with my airway.   The swelling was always worse on my left side of my face.  I received IV fluids &amp; Solumedrol &amp; was discharged with an epi pen, &amp; told to continue the Benadryl, Prednisone, &amp; Pepcid bid.  CoVid test done in ER was negative.

I started feeling dizzy, a buzzing in my ears and broke into a sweat. I tried to stand up and walk over to my bed, but lost my balance and collapsed for about 5 seconds. Once I regained consciousness I stopped sweating, rested for a bit and then was able to resume normal function (drinking water, coffee, something sugary).

Following day rash was bigger and now solid, hot to touch and itchy. Over the course 6 days the rash has continued to spread down and up my arm in a circular shape. Lymph node located in my armpit also became swollen a day after the rash appeared.  I saw the doctor on the 4th day after the rash had appeared. That doctor consulted with dermatology and infectious disease. They are saying that it is a &#34;site&#34; related reaction. Recommendation for treatment is OTC allergy med, ibuprofen and ice.  I&#39;m 12 days post first vaccine and 6 days post start of rash and it&#39;s still ongoing.

Can&#39;t take benadryl during the day, still taking 1 antibiotic.  Day 12: taking 1 antibiotic and no benadryl during the day. it is slightly itchy but doesn&#39;t hurt, not hot, not red, not swollen, but it feels like something is there.

                                                Moderna Vaccine. No immediate reaction. 1/13/21 I noticed there was still a sizable lump at the injection site. Called our Employee Health hotline and they advised to apply heat and massage the area. 1/14/21, I applied heat and massaged the area and within a few hours the injection site started to get red and increase in size, and my eyes began to itch and swell. Took a Benadryl and in the morning there was more swelling in my face. Went to the dr, they couldn&#39;t confirm if was or wasn&#39;t vaccine related, and advised to continue taking Benadryl and apply cool compress if arm was painful. Swelling continued on 1/15 and 1/16. Arm still has a large spot, it is less red in color now, there is still slight heat at the injection site. I have been taking at least 1 Benadryl for the last 7 days now.

                                                I felt instantaneous numbness/tingling from the injection site down to the fingers in my left hand upon receiving the vaccine around 3:40 p.m. During the 15 minute wait period, the numbness persisted. The nurses on staff said that several other people had reported the same. Within about 30-40 minutes after leaving the clinic, I also had bilateral facial numbness and tingling lips. The arm and facial numbness lasted for about 5 hours and lessened right before I went to bed and this morning only my arm hurts (normal vaccine site pain).

At approximately 3:59 PM, patient stated her throat was closing and that she had a rash/hives on the side of her face (on her left cheek bone) - all indicating an anaphylaxis reaction.  A staff member in the observation room immediately administered 0.3 ml of Epinephrine and told the site director to call 911. After administration, patient was able to breathe and the throat swelling subsided. EMS services arrived around 4:10 PM and took patient to emergency room. Patient was able to talk and sit-up before being carried off by EMS.

Began about 18 hours after the injection. That is similar, but higher in intensity, that the response I experienced after my first COVID vaccination. In addition, I also have significant pain and swelling in several axillary lymph nodes on the same side the vaccine was given. Pain is rated 6 out of 10 despite taking Ibuprofen 600mg q4 hours. Pain and swelling in the lymph nodes began about 36 hours after the 2nd vaccination. It has not yet resolved.

                                                I had listed side effects start on 1/22 (the date the injection was administered), starting around 5 pm. This consisted of fever (102), chills, sweats, muscle aches, fatigue, tenderness at the injection site, and headache. The fever (reduced 100ish), muscle aches, tenderness at the injection site, sudden waves of heat flashes, and headache persisted into 1/23. I also had an onset of nausea that evening. On 1/24 I continued to experience a headache, tenderness at the injection site, and sudden waves of heat flashes. However, around 5 pm I noticed my arm (localized to below the injection site) was very red, inflamed, and radiating significant heat. It may have been that way since 1/22, but I didn&#39;t notice. Those same symptoms persisted into 1/25 and I contacted my PCP. I went in for a visit, it was assessed, with no infection noted, and recommendations to watch and belief it would subside. On 1/26 it continues to maintain some redness and radiates heat.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

                                                Thursday morning I awakened sluggish and feeling foggy in the brain. I had chills and a tmeperature of 100.3 with tylenol. At 11:42 am my temp was 102.3. I had severe headache, fatigue, bodyaches, chills. neck stiffness and joint pain, light sensitivity, nausea/loss of appetite. Moderate swelling at injection site (left deltoid) and swollen lymph nodes. Dizziness.  I slept most of the day, awakening to use the bathroom and at that time check my temp. Today 1/29/2021 some things have improved. my temp have improved 98.5, my headache is there but not a 10. I still have not eaten today. I am still taking tylenol. The light sensitivity is gone. The neck stiffness is there, but improving.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included monk fruit allergy and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications reported included hydrochlorothiazide.  On an unknown date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273.   On 28 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Jan 2021, following vaccination, the patient experienced an elevated heart rate of 105-112 beats per minute (bpm). The patient stated that 80 bpm was normal for her. At 7:30 pm, she began wheezing and her lips turned blue, both of which resolved within 2 hours. The patient took ibuprofen, naproxen, and diphenhydramine and sat in a warm tub for an hour and felt better after she covered up in bed.  On 29 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102 degrees Fahrenheit (F) at midnight and 99 degrees F at 5:00 am.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The events, wheezing and lips turned blue, were considered resolved on 28 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm and temperature was 102, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 37-year-old, female patient, with medical history of high blood pressure and allergies to monk fruit, who experienced serious unexpected event of cyanosis, non-serious unexpected event of wheezing, heart rate increased, and non-serious expected event of pyrexia.

She was pretty much herself on morning of 2/13/2021 - got up, had shower.  caregivers noted her extremities were cool and face was red.  temp was 97.4.  She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.  CPR was continued until family could be reached and decision was made to stop resuscitation.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

                                                I woke up on 12/30/20, one week to the day after my vaccine with an itchy red rash on my left arm about 2 inches below the vaccine site. It worsened throughout the day becoming larger, more red, hot and tender to touch. By the end of the day on 12/31/20 the rash was 5-6x bigger than when it started. I saw my PCP via telehealth appt that day and it was determined I likely have cellulitis based on presentation and symptoms. I started taking doxycycline that day and symptoms started to improve.

Progressively, left arm became red, warm to touch, hard, swollen, itchy and painful through the course of the day. It spread rapidly and pain was radiating under left breast, where the lymph nodes are located, behind back/shoulder. The following  day it has spread even further,  down to elbow; numbing/tingling sensation radiating to left pinkie and left ring fingers.   Vital signs: higher than normal systolic BP 130-150s (normal for me:100-110s); tachycardic with HR in 130-140s on the first day of the adverse event, O2 sats normal high 90s to 100% on RA.

                                                I got my 1st shot Monday evening. I was fine, arm started hurting about 9pm which was to be expected. Tuesday I woke up within 20mins I was nauseous and threw up multiple times. My body was achy and just felt &#34;blah&#34;. Was weak and dizzy when I stood up. I felt like my insides were on fire (like the worst temperature you&#39;ve ever had) but didn&#39;t have a fever. Felt like my brain was going to swell out of my head and it was the worst headache. I slept all day. Woke up long enough to call the dr and fell back asleep. Halfway through the day I ended up with a fever of 102 (it went down after a few hrs). Today I woke up still feeling weak and somewhat dizzy, spacey.

Denies any other symptoms at present and is primarily concerned about reporting her rash. No history of anaphylaxis in her medical history or other allergies to food or medications are known to her. Rash appeared scattered to trunk and extremities x4, red, raised, dry bumps that do not itch at present. Agreed that 25-50mg oral benadryl would be a good choice to start, which she states she will do. She in an APRN and states she feels comfortable recognizing new or additional symptoms for which she should seek medical attention, such as difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, worsening of rash, swelling off her face, throat or lips, or dizziness/weakness. She has family at her home as well and is not alone.

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

Today on day four I am Almost back to normal but still some puffiness in both cheeks and bottom lip.  Per my physicians advice I will be on a 5day course of oral prednisone (10mg 2x/day)  The other adverse event I experienced was starting day 2 I had extreme pain and itching as well as some cyst like bumps on both my feet as well as very mild itching on my palms.They are improving on day 4 but still super itchy. I have been advised to take Benadryl as needed for that.

                                                I was given the Covid Vaccine in my left deltoid on a Saturday morning. I developed severe heartburn/indigestion that day but was unsure if symptoms were related to vaccine. My arm was sore for about 3 days after injection which was a common side effect. After that, my arm felt completely fine although I continued to experience severe heartburn. I made an appointment to see my PCP that following Thursday for the heartburn and he ordered a CT Angiogram to r/o thoracic aneurysm. During the imaging test the nurse injected contrast dye into an IV in my left AC, below the site of my Covid vaccine injection 5 days prior.  That night I began feeling pain in my arm and noticed that my lymph node in my left axilla had become swollen. I ignored the symptom, assuming that it was yet another symptom of the vaccine. 3 days later on Sunday evening (8 days after my initial covid vaccine injection), I noticed that my shoulder on and around the vaccine injection site  was  swollen, very warm to touch and was extremely tender and itchy. I immediately called my PCP. The next day (today), on Monday afternoon. A fine red rash has developed.

                                                I had the vaccine Sunday night and experienced fatigue that night, and then developed arm soreness that lasted for a little over 24 hours. I also developed minor body aches and felt crummy Monday and Tuesday. I was then fine for the rest of that week. Monday, January 4th at 7:30 PM, I felt something tingly, burning, and hot on my left arm. When I looked at it, I had a large round red rash that had a knot and was hot to the touch and itchy. At 3:30 AM on Tuesday morning, I woke up in pain and crying. I went to Urgent Care to have it assessed. The doctor diagnosed it as cellulitis in relation to an infection at the injection site and gave me an antibiotic and drew around it with a surgical marker. He told me to go to my PCP if it grew outside of the line or to the ER if I developed severe symptoms. On Wednesday, it had grown and was not getting any better and had started forming blisters. I called my PCP and he told me to take 2 Loratadine every 24 hours and to come in if it was not better by Friday. It appeared to be getting better and I was fine on Thursday. Friday morning, I woke up in pain again. The rash had spread across the majority of my upper arm. It was red and painful and itching with heat. I went in to see my PCP and he diagnosed it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He gave me a steroid, which seems to be suppressing the rash and symptoms. I still have a rash and itchiness, but my physician said it could last for another week or two until it goes away.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

I was told to consult with my PCP but he doesn&#39;t know because &#34;we  use Pfizer here, not Moderna. Follow the website link.&#34; The site where the vaccine was given looks like my skin is discolor now -turning brown like leaving a mark around the lump (birth mark look like).

Yesterday, 1/14/21(9days after receiving the vaccine), I noticed that my arm was itching where I received the vaccine and when I looked it was all red and swollen. Not having any pain and have had no other reactions to the vaccine. I am scheduled February 2nd for my 2nd vaccine. Will it be okay to receive it?

After 5 days?: Developed small red, slightly elevated dots on left hand.  Also, developed white circular patch on left shoulder.  The red dots on left hand are improving day by day. The white patch on shoulder is still there.  Visited my doctor today (Jan 15). He discussed hypersensitivity on left hand, and vitiligo on left shoulder.  I am concerned about getting 2nd dose of vaccine and possible reaction thereafter.  Why did I get vitiligo? Will vitiligo worsen after 2nd dose? Will the hypersensitivy on hand translate to a stronger reaction/allergic reaction after 2nd dose? Thank you.

Dx UTI / Kidney infection.  Unlikely related to vaccine per PCP.  1/1/2020 - 1/5/2020 - swollen lymph nodes.  Continued to have random bouts of body aches and chills that seem to have resolved.  Random itching of injection site. General fatigue.  Have had previous reaction to flu shot, mainly 10&#43; years ago when shot was not preservative free.

Swelling went down, though not entirely, after I woke up and went about my day. Sent a photo of my nose with notes to my general practitioner who suspected it was a delayed reaction to the vaccine and instructed me to take an antihistamine that evening.

I took a Benedryl or Claritin and Advil.  Eight  hours after the 1st vaccine, I experienced severe aches and pain, fatigue lasting almost 72hrs. Even the joints of fingers aches but the pain in my lymph node in my left armpit felt like someone hit me with a baseball bat (injection was in left arm).

Tongue was a little swollen at this point. Airway was regularly checked and did not close.

NP gave her epinephrine at 3:19 and called 911 and patient was transported to ER (I think Hospital patient will know more). NP did follow  up  with patient later that 4:42 PM and patient said she was feeling better and received Benadryl and Solumedro.    **follow up with patient for missing information as reporter does not have access to it**

Notified nursed overseeing the monitoring.  Nurses began hooking my up to monitoring equipment. Heart rate came down to 120.  Nurses noticed flushing in face and blotchiness on arms. After an additional 15 minutes of monitoring, flushing was still present as well as throat tingling (just tingling, no swelling), so nurses sent me to the ER for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to ER temperature was 100.2 F. (Temperature before vaccine was 97 F, no fevers recorded after ER visit).  In ER fluids and zofran were given and was released after two hours of monitoring.  In the evening I experienced moderate pain in the left arm (very painful to lift arm above shoulder level) that lasted about 24 hours.  I also had a mild to moderate headache that lasted about 24 hours, beginning the evening of the vaccine.   I also experienced mild to moderate nausea that began the day of the vaccine (Saturday, 12/26) and was on and off through Wednesday, 12/30.

I was released, and went to work the next morning feeling OK. That evening on day eight I got a fever, tachycardia in the 150s, chills. The area on my arm was on fire, red with an area 12 x 9 cm area where the injection was given. My employer made me go back to the ER to have it seen. They prescribed me Benadryl, Pepcid. Fever had stopped.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

Little out of it feeling.  This was pretty much done by 1/1/21. 1/7/21 one week and a day after injection, injection site became raised, hard, inflamed looking  and was itchy. Site was visibly red and raised and had approximate 3 in diameter.  Previously mentioned symptoms began again (waves of hot flashes, nausea, aches).  This lasted at least until bedtime.  Next day, 1/8/21 felt better and injection site, though still hard and red, reduced down to size of quarter.  No further symptoms BUT injection site now as of 1/20/21 still looks like a quarter sized bruise.

                                                About 5-6 days after vaccine injection on 1/15/21, I developed a rash, itching, and pain on the same arm as my injection. It is also warm to the touch. I went to Urgent Care and they think it is cellulitis from the vaccine. I am on Bactrim DS to see if it will help. My blood pressure was low as well, not sure if it&#39;s related but usually by pressure is fine. I had cupping done at the chiropractor on 1/22 on my neck and back, symptoms started later that evening. Not sure if is is a coincidence or not.

                                                The following day I had redness at the injection site about 2/12 inches long and wide with itching and minor swelling/bump. The day following also was tired achy and felt off/headache. On Thursday symptoms went away other than the arm and a slight headache. On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

After about an hour, my arm was swollen and very painful to move and touch. I put an ice pack on and took Tylenol but the pain and swelling didn?t completely subside. I went to bed with Tylenol PM to help me sleep and woke up several times from the pain. Throughout the day today (2nd day), the pain has steadily gotten worse. I can barely move my arm due to the immense pain. The swelling is still there. I have been icing it and taking Tylenol but the pain has only gotten worse. I feel achy in my neck and the pain is radiating down my arm to my forearm, wrist, and fingers.

The red areas were swollen, hot to touch, and each were a hard lump a little larger than a marble.  These two spots were about 3 inches below the injection site and an inch closer to the body midline.  These red spots worsened and joined together.  1/28/21 I was still experiencing the red raised area that had grown in size, still hot to the touch and now red and rashy around the outer edge.  Redness diminished over the weekend and resolved by 2/3/21.  Arm and shoulder still are achy and sore.

Days following, the bumps started spreading to my left hand, abdomen and continued. I received my second dose on 01/31/2021, and have continued to have the itchy rash spreading to different body parts (thighs, chest, and face). Benadryl controls the itching, but bumps continue to appear and itch.

The next day, I had chills and a mild fever, along with swollen and sore arm. Through the weekend, I developed redness in splotches that were similar to hives in appearance. My arm has been intensely itchy. On Saturday, 2.20.21, the lymph node under my left arm became very swollen and painful. I am currently still experiencing a mildly sore arm (pain has lessened since yesterday), arm is still very hot to the touch, still have red rash/hives and my lymph node is still very painful.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

                                                Received vaccine Thursday afternoon. Waited for a half hour after receiving the vaccine, as there is a history of anaphylaxis. On the drive home lips began to swell and the lips felt numb. Patient went home and took some Benadryl which seemed to help.  Friday 3/5  Patient woke and her arm was swollen at the injection site and was very painful. Patient also complained of a headache at that time. Later that same day, Patient developed a rash at the injection site and intense itching all over her body including her face. Patient went to the Medical Center ER. At ER the staff evaluated her and administered IV steroids and Benadryl and sent her home with instructions to return in worsens. Saturday Patient complained that her throat began swelling and so she went back to the ER. The  ER gave more IV steroids and Benadryl, a breathing treatment (nebulizer), and gave 2 doses of epinephrine. Due to Patient&#39;s continued symptoms and gradual worsening condition the medical provider at ER felt  it necessary for Patient to be admitted, however, due to the smaller size and limited resources at ER it was decided for Patient to be transported to Hospital. Patient has remained admitted at Hospital since then, and yesterday (Sunday) she required another dose of epinephrine due to tongue swelling.  Patient reports that she is being given IV Benadryl and steroids, and she will not be discharged today. Today Patient is also reporting a burning sensation with urination.

                                                Starting  just a few hours after the immunization I had a red swollen rash around the injection sight, about the size of a nickel. It was painful, but not anymore then a regular flu immunization. I thought I was possibly just reacting to the bandage. However, by the end of the night the redness and swelling had grown to about the size of a silver dollar. The next morning it had swollen to the size of a baseball, was red inflamed and warm to the touch. It only itched when it was touched by something, but was quite sore. I tried some Benadryl cream and took my normal allergy pills I also started using an ice pack trying to keep the heat and swelling down. None of this seemed to help. I also started to feel dizzy and had a headache, normal reactions to immunizations. I did sleep off and on all day this first day after the immunization as I felt weak and dizzy. The swelling just kept getting larger and large no matter what I tried. The second day after the immunization the swelling was around the size of a soft ball, and it was very red, inflamed and almost hot to the touch. Again I used Zyrtec, Benadryl cream and also tried a washcloth soaked with witch hazel, this did not seem to help. Later I went to a friends house and she had some Triamcinolone cream and colloidal silver, I tried both of these and the swelling and warmth did start going down. The redness has stayed about the same (now about the size of a grapefruit). It has started itching, but not constant, and not like my typical allergy itch.

                                                I took the &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34; on December 31, 2020. I had pain/soreness at the injection site for 3 days, but I still have other side effects since getting the vaccine. The side effects started out with mild muscle pain and joint pain on the 31st, then in the night and for every day since the vaccine I have had headaches which I am taking ibuprofen for. I also feel quite fatigued since getting the injection. In the last few days I also had cold sweats, and chills yesterday. Today, I still have headache and fatigue.

                                                Patient received her # 1 moderna on 12/30/2020.  Eight days later on 01/07/21 she woke up and felt a &#34;bee sting sensation&#34;.  She looked at her arm and noticed below the injection site was a reddened area approx 2.5 inches long by 2.0 inches wide.  The &#34;bee sting sensation&#34; has gone away shortly after noticing the reddened are and now is just tender to the touch.  Encouraged patient to put Ice on the reddened area and or Tylenol or Ibuprofen if needed for pain or swelling. Patient will report back to me tomorrow.  The health department will monitor this situation over the next couple of days. Encouraged patient to follow up with her primary care physician for worsening symptoms.

                                                Client reported tightness when swallowing approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccination, but no shortness of breath or dizziness.  She felt flushing throughout her entire body as well as some tingling. At 7:05 pm, her oxygen saturation was 97% and her blood pressure was 115/80.  She also had red, irregular-shaped  spots on her right, upper arm  (non-vaccinated arm) and upper back.  At 7:13 pm her oxygen saturation was 98% and her heart rate was 111. She then described the tightness when swallowing from earlier as if the muscles in her throat were numbed, which made it hard to swallow, but not hard to breathe. The tightness improved slightly during the 30 minutes that she was observed, but it did not go away. She felt comfortable leaving and knew which signs to look for that would indicate that she needed to seek medical attention.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                Within 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I started getting a tingling sensation in my lips and cheeks. It lasted approximately one hour. Felt tired the rest of the day. I awoke at around 2am the next morning with diarrhea, extreme chills and bodyaches, and a headache. My right arm was very sore, but I expected that. I went back to bed and awoke for work at 6am. My injection site was red, puffy, and heat to the touch. My body ached as if I had a bad case of the flu. The next morning, I awoke with nausea and vomiting. It lasted until around 9am.  The aches have eased up, but I remain very tired and my injection site is still very red, puffy, and warm to the touch. It feels as if there are knots under the skin.

                                                6 days after vaccination, I started to feel ill. Throat slightly scratching, almost like I was getting a cold. Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

                                                Five days following  administration of the vaccine, axillary lymphadenopathy occurred, on the same side of the body in which the vaccine was administered. Lymphadenopathy persisted for 48 hours. Seven days following vaccine administration, an erythematous rash developed on the left wrist. The following day (eight days following vaccine administration), the rash spready to encompass the upper left arm and shoulder. Generalized severe pruritis was noted, not localized to the area of the rash. Pruritic involvement included but was not limited to scalp, face and, lips. The rash and pruritis did not resolve following oral antihistamine administration.

On approximately January 13th, I noticed that my arm was swelling and red and felt warm to the touch. I went to a doctor on January 14 and I was diagnosed with cellulitis secondary to the vaccine and prescribed antibiotics for 10 days.

Pain has subsided in axillary area at this time, but lymph nodes are still enlarged (can be felt at rest just by lowering my arm), and lymph nodes along left clavicle remain tender to palpation. Second dose of series is expected to be administered on 1/27/2021.

                                                Got my 1st covid vaccine around 9:30 am 1-18-21. Shot was administered with no issue, waited my 15 minutes and went home. Was feeling a little tired throughout the day and around 9 pm noticed I was starting to notice some mild flu skin, body aches and headache.  Went to bed around 10 and had slight shivering but figured it was maybe just a low grade fever and covered up with another blanket.  Within 20 minutes I had full blown rigors. My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn&#39;t so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night. Slept on and off all through the day 1-19-21 taking acetaminophen 2 more times for headache and sore body. Went to bed around 10 pm and woke up back to normal 1-20-21

She was taken to the ER, and in ER said her throat started to feel tight and itchy.

                                                within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine I started to become itchy.  My face started itching. I left the clinic without saying anything by the time I got home from the clinic another 10 minutes I was itchy all over and my throat started to feel funny.  I immediately took Benadryl  I went to urgent care where they said it was an allergic reaction but did not give me steroids. I continued to itch and have a weird feeling in my throat I then went to my family Dr. where I had hives, extreme itching and they prescribed me steroids.  I did my first round of steroids where I seemed to be getting better.  I finished the steroids and within a day I was back to having hives as well as extreme itching and a very itchy throat again.  Later that day I went to the ER and was put on a second round of steroids., I have finished the 2nd round, I am still itchy not terribly though as of now.

THEY WOULD GO AWAY AND RETURN DAYS LATER ON OTHER PART OF THE MOUTH. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT 3 TIMES AND THE LAST TIME WAS ON TUESDAY 1/19/21 WHERE I DEVELOPED A HUGE PAINFUL LUMP UNDER MY JAW BY THE EVENING. I DON&#39;T USUALLY SUFFER FROM MOUTH BLISTERS. I HAVE ONLY DEVELOPED THEM 3 TO 5 TIMES IN MY ENTIRE LIFETIME. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY PRIMARY DOCTOR, WHO CONFIRMED THAT THE LUMP WAS A SWOLLEN LYMPH NODE, IT WAS HUGE, THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL. SHE DID A PHYSICAL ON ME TO CHECK IF I WAS SICK AND HAD NO OTHER SYMPTOMS ASIDE FROM THE MOUTH BLISTERS AND THE HUGE LYMPH NODE.

                                                Legs extremely weak and felt like muscles were not functioning well. Knees were buckling while standing. Started about 4 hours after vaccination. Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.

                                                No side effects from first vaccine except soreness to site. This time around I was too lethargic for three days to get out of bed. I had a rash around site that progressed up to the right side of my face and also right side of my lower back the following day. The rash was also accompanied by blotches and is still there only on the side of the injection. I had metallic taste for on and off the first 2-3 days. I am feeling a bit better, well enough to work today. Still very fatigued. On Thursday I also had a 102 fever that Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help me at all at night. I finally stopped sweating yesterday. The blotches are now improving . Only thing that remains is the fatigue.

Over-the-counter antihistamines alleviated the symptoms temporarily but in 6 hours I had to go to the ER where prednisone was administered with good effect. Feel better the next day, with daily prednisone and over-the-counter Claritin, Pepcid and Benadryl.

My nose was congested for approximately 8 hours after.

Upon returning to work in the pharmacy, she sat down at her desk and noted her HR to be 159 via her Apple watch. She felt slightly lightheaded, so returned to  Auditorium for monitoring. On arrival, she complained only of high HR, no other symptoms. We checked her VS: BP 140/78, HR 132, RR 20, SaO2 94. She denied chest pain or SOB. We monitored her for about 15 minutes, and her HR decreased to 103-110. We monitored her for another 15 minutes or so, at which time her HR spiked again to 132, and she felt heavy in her chest and tight in her throat. At that point, we moved her to a gurney and called a Rapid Response. We administered 50mg of Benadryl IM per protocol, foregoing the Epinephrine, due to her tachycardic state. The Rapid Response team arrived and she was transported to the ED for evaluation. She maintained consciousness and was A&amp;Ox3 the entire time.

                                                I had previous anaphylaxis events that were treated and did not require hospitalization. I brought epinephrine pen and premedicated with Xyzal 5mg 9 hours before and Benadryl 25mg 1.5 hours before vaccine. 20 minutes after vaccine I felt flushing, nausea, low blood pressure. They had released me from the drive through vaccination site and I was driving and felt panicky, so I pulled over. I waited 10 minutes because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anaphylaxis or not. I felt OK after 10 minutes, so I drove to nearest ER and waited in parking lot several hours then drove home. I probably should have administered epinephrine and called 911 when I had that reaction. Continued with 25mg Benadryl every 4 hours and nightly Xyzal 5mg. The next morning (24 hours later)  I woke up scratching my face. I had a diffuse sandpaper rash all over my head and neck and was very itchy. Doubled my dose of Benadryl to 50mg every 4 hours. Also took 400mg of quercetin. The itching resolved and the rash was gone the next day, which was 48 hours after vaccine. I was fatigued for several days but fatigue is my baseline as a narcoleptic plus I was taking benadryl. I continued the Benadryl for a total of 4 days. I normally do not develop rashes unless I rub against hay and I did not have any contact with hay.
