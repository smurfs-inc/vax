                                                Caretaker at Facility contacted me to tell me that this morning, patients left arm is red and raised all the way to the elbow and very painful. Patient gets scheduled ibuprofen for arthritis which is helping.  She has had no other problems with other vaccinations including flu shot Fall 2020. Denies SOB, swollen tongue or throat, or rash/red areas anywhere else on body. Wondering if getting vaccine 3-1/2 months after getting COVID may be reason she is reacting. Caretaker anticipates she will recover just fine but is concerned about giving 2nd shot of series.

Patient&#39;s son tried to call her around 3:30 or 4 and there was no answer. Son called the facility where patient resided and staff went to check on her, where they found patient on the floor, conscious. Patient was communicating fine when they found her. It is unclear if she bumped her head when she fell, but patient deteriorated and was taken to ER where a CT was done and it was determined patient had a brain bleed as well as a UTI. Patient was admitted to hospital. Patient subsequently had a stroke while in hospital. Patient was discharged to rehab facility on 02.23.2021 and while she has regained the ability to walk with a walker and some use of her right hand, she remains unable to speak.

                                                My mom received her first Moderna Vaccine on 1/22/21. Late on 1/23 her face began to swell so the staff called the ambulance to come take her to the hospital for what they thought was an abscessed tooth. ER doctor said there was an infection and that she needed to be seen by an oral surgeon. On 1/25/21 I took my mom to Dr., her oral surgeon and after the examination he advised that there was no abscess but an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He suggested Benadryl. I gave her benadryl and the swelling started subsiding. From this point on her gums and teeth hurt. Her eating habits started to decline. She received her 2nd Moderna vaccine on 2/19/21 and from that point on she could no longer chew or brush her teeth because the pain was so severe. She passed on 3/19/21.
