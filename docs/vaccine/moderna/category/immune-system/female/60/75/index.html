Began to feel dizzy, weak, was sweating, and had a flushed appearance in face.  On attempt to stand, felt like I could not take a step.  In ER vitals were normal except for blood pressure was high.  Was discharged after receiving IV fluids, lab tests, EKG.  About 5 hours later, I developed a low grade fever of 99.7, blood pressure 142/92, chills,  general malaise and body aches.  Symptoms started dissipating later in the evening.  Started feeling better as the day progressed the next day.

Around 1115 she was still dizzy, stated she didn?t have much to drink or eat, so we brought her water and a snack.  No hx of diabetes. 1120 she looked flushed, and now had tingling in her left arm.  Took her BP 140/70, HR 70,  temp on her forehead 97.1.   1130 she continued to have a strange feeling in her arm from her shot site to her left hand, and up her neck.  Vaccinator counseled her to take an antihistamine once she gets home. Patient called her husband and her son who would take 40 minutes to come get her. She began to exercise her left arm, and began to feel better. She left with her family at approximately 1:00, still a little dizzy, no longer flushed with less discomfort.  We called her at 7;15 pm and she reported that symptoms had resolved.  Took Zyrtec. Extended observation and sent home.

                                                Patient received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at her place of employment as a phase 1A essential frontline healthcare worker in a skilled nursing LTC facility on January 6 2021. The day after receiving the vaccine (1-7-21), she started to feel increased shortness of breath (she has shortness of breath at baseline due to chronic health conditions- CHF, asthma), a heavy feeling in her chest/lungs, sweating and fatigue. She contacted the pharmacy on January 8th, as we were the entity that vaccinated her to ask about vaccine reaction. Due to her medical history of MI and CHF, pharmacist did not want to dismiss this as a reaction to the vaccine, and recommended that she contact her doctor for further guidance. She did reach out to her care team, and ended up going to the emergency room for testing due to cardiac history and presentation of symptoms. She had diagnostic testing done (see item 19) and the ER doctor attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of CHF and asthma, noting that vaccine involvement in the worsening of her symptoms can not be ruled out. Treatment/discharge instructions include: follow up with cardiology/pulmonology, furosemide dose was increased, potassium supplement restarted, and instructed to use inhalers already on hand when needed. As of time of report on January 9 2021, the patient was resting at home, doing well except still having symptoms upon exertion.

EMT administered 50ml benedryl and pushed 125ml saline.  No response.  Throat felt tight, not closed but tight.  Offered EpiPen .3 agreed.  Body reaction - shaking.  Went to Hospital ER via ambulance (~11am).  ER administered 50mg steroid and had 2 puffs of albuterol inhaler twice.  Became very tired but felt heart raced - assumed reaction to steroid/albuterol.  2:30pm started to finally feel relief.  Discharged 4pm with rx for prednisone 50mg 1/day-10 days and benedryl 25mg for that night and am/pm next day.  O2 dropped to 94 that evening.  Administered 3 rounds of 2 liters/minute before saturation held at 97. 1-9-2021:  9am took benedryl and prednisone doses.  10am both nostrils still feel &#34;swollen,&#34; legs are weak and very tired (benedryl?).  Oxygen saturation is good - 97.  Starting to feel slight sensitivity at injection site.  4pm able to shower and move around.  Breathing is better.  Elected not to take benedryl as I&#39;m not getting an positive response from it, only fatigue.  Nostrils still feel swollen - tried lubricated nasal spray, not much help. 1-10-2021:  8:30 prednisone dose  Oxygen saturation good - 98% pulse 72.  Nostrils still feel swollen.  Injected site sore,  Started around 4pm (similar to shingles vaccine - expected).

The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

I called my husband and with that I broke out in a very cold sweat and then fell asleep for 2 hours.  I was cold from sleeping in the cold sweat I believe but nothing after.

                                                I filed the V-Safe for one week. Originally my arm was firm and red, and swollen...that went away in 2 days, and I felt fine. Oddly yesterday, my arm started another identical reaction from the vaccine, where it was a small white area, then became red and inflamed in an hours time. It was warm to touch. Very itchy this time. I used a no touch thermometer on it and it read 100.4. My forehead temp was 97. It is feeling better and going away again, but I thought it was odd and that you should know. Thanks.

Then i was ok for 2 days then my arm started to hurt and i got a runny nose and a mild headache and fatigue. My nose ran so much i did not work the next day. I received a negative covid PCR test. then 1 day later my left arm started to itch, turn red and swell. It has continued through today (the swelling is about 4 inches by 3 inches, over my left deltoid). i just took Benadryl. i am now on day 9 post vaccination.

                                                5 hours after the shingles vaccine on 1/14/21 I could not form words and it was extremely difficult to speak. The wrong word came out. I felt dizzy and out of it. This lasted for 2-3 hours. The next day it was much better but I still feel that problem a little bit. Secondly, I felt tingling in my head, arms and legs since then, slowly waning.

                                                After sitting  for about 10 minutes, I noticed my tongue was swelling up in the back of my throat. I noticed my airway was narrowed and tongue felt very tight, but I was still able to breath. I told the man at the doorway assigned to help people find a seat after their shots. He said, &#34;We all have different reactions,&#34; brought me water, and I drank it.  After another 10 minutes, the symptoms were the same, not better not worse. After 10 more minutes the symptoms were better. And after another 10 minutes, I left.  When I made it back to my car, I noticed tightening across my forehead. This developed into a frontal lobe headache which continued off and on for the next 3 days. Also noted for the next 2 days was waking with swollen lips, face and extremities, and occasional ringing in the ears lasting 1-2 hours.

                                                Within a few minutes of injection had tingling sensation in tongue, followed by a couple days of increased stomach gas, tons of burping, some reflux, took Prevacid. Tongue seemed to affected during the first several days, especially along the sides, red. Didn&#39;t get concerned at first.  The common sore arm, cleared up within a few days. On about day 10 noticed large area on arm where injection given, warm red area about 4 inches by 3 inches, itchy, resolved on own by day 14 or 15.  The next week (third week) mouth seemed to be getting more sore, swallowing harder, took prevacid. Today, day 27, mouth is sore, especially noticeable along sides where there are circle looking ulcerations where surface tissue seems to be missing. Very discouraged. Doubt I feel able to receive second dose which has been postponed, by myself, until day 30. Seeing primary doctor on day 30.

                                                After the 1st dose, two days later I had an infected tooth.  After 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine, I woke up the 2nd day with my neck lymph glands completely swollen, my jaw hurt really bad, and every tooth in my mouth hurt, and I had another infected tooth on the other side of my mouth.  I had to take an antibiotic for both tooth infections.  Teeth were not infected prior.  By the end of day 2, my lymph nodes were back to normal using Advil for swelling.

                                                The first day I had pain in left arm around injection. Couldn&#39;t sleep on it. Next day it was itchy but pain had subsided. Next day itching was almost gone. By Wednesday January 27 I thought everything was gone. Getting dressed that night I noticed a red rash developed around or near injection site. About 1 inch by 2 inch oval, slightly raised, slightly warm, slightly itchy. This morning January 29, it is still there less itchy and less red, but still visible outline. I was being followed by vsafe up to wednesday afternoon the 27th. I thought I shouldn&#39;t wait til next week for the vsafe check in.

I had to stop working that day and the next day. The headache was unrelenting. I went to bed with a heating pad on my head. Typically my body temp is 97.3 it went up to 98.1 I took Ibuprofen and Benadryl around the clock for the next 10 days. Day 8 &amp; 9 were the worst. My arm looked like an orange at the site of the injection; it was red/inflamed, induration &amp; itched. The welt size 2&#34; x 1&#34;. My headache was intractable, severe chills with teeth chattering, nausea, GI turbulence. It was a horrible 48 hours at which time I was again not able to work. I finally felt better on day 10. On day 14 my arm finally looked like it had not had an injection in it.

                                                About 3 PM she received her second vaccination for Covid.  She states that she has a history of adverse reactions to flu vaccines that are anaphylactic like in the past.  She usually premedicates with Benadryl and steroids.  Today she did take 100 mg of Benadryl prior to her vaccination.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine, she did feel like her throat was getting a little bit tight but she did not feel like it was true anaphylaxis.  However she then felt very off.  After this vaccine her throat started to feel tight, and she stated she did not feel well overall.  She did have some tunnel vision and was shaky. At about 1730 her heart rate drops to the 30s, she started feeling itchy, and then she went into a coughing fit and started to feel her throat close. She received 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, 20 mg IV famotidine, 125 mg IV methylprednisone, 0.5 mL of nebulized racepinephrine, and 500 mL NS bolus. She has since recovered and is stable on room air.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful.

I took my temperature and headed to bed to rest, feel asleep and work up for another call and felt like my fever had broken with a sweat feeling. I felt much better and finished my night on call and home on holiday at 1 pm.

HAD A VERY MINOR HEADACHE THE TWO DAYS FOLLOWING THE VACCINE, JUST MILD DISCOMFORT.  FULLY RESOLVED ON ITS OWN AFTER TWO DAYS.  2.  MONDAY, JANUARY 4 WHEN I WOKE UP I FELT &#34;PUFFY&#34; - FEET AND HANDS WERE MILDLY SWOLLEN.  NOTICED MY SHOES FELT TIGHTER THAN USUAL AND HANDS FELT A BIT DIFFICULT TO FULLY CLOSE.  THIS IS FLUID RETENTION, AS IF YOU HAD TOO MUCH SALTY FOOD THE DAY BEFORE, AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS I HAD INGESTED MORE SALT THAN I REALIZED ON SUNDAY.  BUT IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE THAT OCCURRED FOR ME AND MY DIET DOES NOT INCLUDE MUCH SALT OR PROCESSED FOODS.  THEN TODAY MY FEET AND HANDS STILL FEEL PUFFY, SHOES STILL A BIT TIGHT AND HANDS A BIT HARD TO CLOSE SO THERE IS STILL SOME FLUID RETENTION GOING ON.  THIS IS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR ME, I AM QUITE HEALTHY AND HAVE A GOOD DIET AND DON&#39;T RECALL THIS HAPPENING BEFORE.    AGAIN, NOT AT ALL SURE THIS IS RELATED TO THE VACCINE, IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HEAD COLD, BUT AS I AM NOT SURE AND THIS IS UNUSUAL AND HAS OCCURRED AFTER RECEIVING THE VACCINE, I FELT I SHOULD REPORT IT.  THIS EFFECT IS VERY MILD AND I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND IT.

It is hard to lift my left arm up and put it across my chest because that hurts. It hurts in my lymph nodes and my joints. I had to go the the ER on 12/31/20 because of this. they gave me a shot of Prednisoneand Hydroxyzihe that helped for a coupled of days and then I had to go back to the ER on 1/6/21 because of the same symptoms. They gave me Benadryl,prednisone and pepcid. I am still itching.

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

About day six it started to feel a bit better.  A week and a half later it still had a large hard knot at the injection site by 1.16.21 it started to itch. On 1.17.21 it began to itch really bad and swell  and get hard again, that evening I used topical Benadryl and hydrocortisone which made the itch dissipate slightly.   On 1.20. the swelling is noticeable from six feet away and can be seen popping up under my shirt sleeve.  I made an appointment with a doctor for 1.21.21.

However, I could breathe easily so I just remained to relax and slowly swallowing my salia over and over again. Once home took a benedryl and was able to drink water without any problems. My throat is still somewhat scratchy after 2 hours.

Due to this we observed her for 30 minutes following administration of vaccine.  About 25 minutes into her observation period she began developing hives on her forearms and wasn&#39;t feeling her normal self.  She denied any respiratory symptoms but was continuously clearing her throat and when asked if she normally did that, she stated that she did not.  Decision was made to take vital signs and administer 50mg of IM Diphenhydramine.  She was agreeable to this plan .  After administering Diphenhydramine, we continued to monitor her vitals and had her stay another 45 minutes for observation.  Hives resolved and vital signs remained within normal limits.  Patient was education on allergic  reactions and she to seek medical care.  Patient verbalized understanding and felt  back to her normal self.

                                                Developed a rash red with red pustules ( No drainage) on my fingers approx 3 days after injection. I have since developed these all over both hands palms and top as well as my arms, feet and legs its itchy and painful. . Saw Dr today and he is unsure what the rash is. but says it could be related to shot. Gave me a Medrol Dose pack.

                                                On  January 16, the day after being vaccinated (1/15/21),  I woke up with my arms, hands, legs and feet tingling and numb all over and it lasted on and off all day January 16 and on and off all day January 17 and has persisted every day until Monday, January 26 when the symptoms became worse. Instead of tingling in all extremities (with some numbness)  the sensations changed to a pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shock sensations. I want to note that, yes, I have radiculopathies  - however, I have never had them change so suddenly and increase in intensity so fast. Also, the pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shocks are brand new symptoms for me (my radiculopathies have not presented this way before).  I reported these symptoms to my primary care provider today (1/29/21) and she instructed me to report my symptoms to VAERS and she is referring me to neurology. Note: I received my vaccination outside of my health care system and received it through the county because I could get the vaccination sooner that way.  I did not report these symptoms sooner because they were not listed as a possible adverse effect of getting the COVID19 Moderna  vaccination. However, as these symptoms have worsened over the past 2 weeks I have become concerned.  I have not added any OTC medications or supplements to the ones listed prior. I have gone to a chiropractor twice during this time for relief of my back pain with  no positive outcomes. Waiting to see the neurologist.

On January 15 developed an itchy, red, hot rash about 1/2 inch below injection site.  The area was approximately 3 in by2.5 in with swelling.  Also had 5 hives break out on my body.  I took 1/2 a Benedryl and used clobetasol propionate ointment on the area until the rash went away (7 days).  The swelling took another 5 days to subside.

She still has some aches in her joints, but not as severe.  The rash is deep red today, swollen with hard ridges, very itchy and very hot to touch.  She has not taken anything for it.  She has been having a harder time than usual breathing, but not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine or not.  She has less than 20% of her lungs.

On March 19, 2021 she was on the floor laying beside of the bed and my father noticed blood looking stuff on her shirt and bed covers. She was really confused and lethargic. She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

Contacted via phone and e-mail, Occupational Health Services on 1/1/2021. I also saw  an ED physician at on 1/1/2021 who said a local inflammation reaction was unlikely, probably cellulitis, and prescribed doxycycline. The affected area of my arm was marked to follow progression of red, warm area.  Began doxycycline 1/1/2021. Next morning red, warm area of arm is now outside of marked area and down to below my elbow.  I have an appointment with Occupational Health on Monday, January 4,2021.

I was monitored by EMS and given 50 mg IM Benadryl. After 30 - 40 min. symptoms cleared.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

The soreness lasted only one day and then no other symptoms until day 8.  On day 8, the injection site was red, itchy and raised.  Then yesterday, day 9 my are was tender to touch, VERY RED and HOT and expanding all over my arm, now in the back of my arm.  All the time remaining afebrile.  V-safe will only check in with me once a week from day 7, for 5 weeks, I am told so I wanted to report this.  I am waiting for a call from my PCP.  She is considering cellulitis, that is how red and hot it is but it is only tender, not hurting or requiring any pain medication.  I have good range of motion, too.

                                                I stayed my 30 minutes as directed in a room since I have needed IV Benedryl in past with blood transfusions. Toward the end of my 30-minute wait, I noticed my lips tingling/swelling.    I ALWAYS carry an antihistamine with me, so  I walked out to my car and noticed that my lips felt full.  I needed to run my tongue around them and I immediately took a Zyrtec.  I never did feel short of breath, but with many times in my life getting giant hives due to allergies/ blood transfusion ( secondary to my hemophilia), I feel this was a type of allergic reaction.  I&#39;ve never had the lip-tingling thing before with any other vaccine.  I&#39;ve had both pneumonia and both Shingrix vaccines and always get my influenza vaccine since I&#39;m immunosuppressed and work in a Doctors office daily.

                                                24 hours after the vaccine I had a 102 fever overnight.  The next day, my feet were hurting, like burning.  They continued like this but with fluctuating severity.  My calves and shin muscles began to be sore.  I sought out acupuncture and myofascia release work to help.  It did help temporarily.  I started to have left ankle pain, not like a sprain, like tendonitis or inflammation.  It continued to hurt to walk and the muscles more painful.  I started having darker urine about 4 days after the vaccine.  I drank cranberry juice and took a kidney/bladder supplement, increased fluids, but it continued dark.  I went to the Urgent Care on January 7th c/o muscle pain and dark urine.  My blood pressure was elevated, 179/100..unusual for me, and my urine was neg so it was sent for culture and blood was drawn for CBC and metabollic panel and Creatine Kinase

I was bloated, swollen, nauseous. About 4 hours after the vaccine there was some relief, but the pain came back multiple times that night, would subside and was mostly better the next day. I did vomit around 7pm. I took antacids and simethecone with no relief.

I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

                                                Hi,  I was vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine (1st administration) on 1/13/21. I have had persistent and very significant swelling since that day and it has not abated as of today, 1/20/21. The reason for this report is that I believe the swelling is not typical axillary swelling which I believe would be right under the arm where the lymph nodes are; rather it is located lower down and much farther away from where the lymph nodes are under my arm. It is a large swelling that is located to the side of my chest on the same side of the body as my vaccinated arm (which was my left arm).   I have not checked fever but do not think I have any. I do have headache as of today. Can you advise on whether this swelling is a typical reaction and whether there are any steps I should take at this time ?  Thanks very much,

                                                Had headache, fatigue, brain fog for 3 days also very sore arm. On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

On 24 Jan 2021, about 15 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24 Jan 2021, 30 minutes prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient took prednisone (dose unknown), per instructions from her doctor due to her history of anaphylactic reactions. She did notify the vaccinators of her history and there was an ambulance present. About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient started coughing, had heavy chest pain, trouble breathing, and felt like her throat was constricting more than usual. No rash developed. She approached the ambulance and asked if she could take diphenhydramine. She took one dose, followed by 3 other doses, and felt a bit better. Consent given for Safety to follow up with patient.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event, anaphylactic reaction was resolving at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62 year old female patient with medical history of included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

                                                A 63-year-old female with a medical history of Hashimoto?s Disease, on Levothyroxine 88 micrograms (4 days per week) and 100 micrograms (3 days per week), presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of acute onset of severe, debilitating, fatigue, weakness, anorexia and malaise. She had no clear precipitating events, stated that she was in her usual states of health, active, working as an optometrist at a University hospital. Stated that 1 week before symptom oncer she had her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Stated that 24hrs later her symptoms started associated with low grade subjective fever, however her fever disappeared, and she persisted with severe fatigue. She was unable to do her regular activities of daily living and was hoping her symptoms would resolve but upon persistence and given the severity of her complains she presented to evaluation. She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA &gt;1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 &gt; 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.

She woke up on 3/10/21 around 1145 with facial/neck swelling, urticaria,  and shortness of breath and presented to the ER at 1250. Upon arrival she was given 50mg benadryl IVP, 20mg Pepcid IVP, and 125mg Solu-medrol IVP. Soft tissue neck xray showed subglottic narrowing and thickened epiglottis. She had some improvement after IV medications but was admitted to ICU for observation overnight. She was discharged 3/12/2021 in stable conditions on steroids and antihistamines. Pt&#39;s vaccine card did not list vaccine lot number. I reached out to facility for the lot number and have not heard back.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported were levothyroxine, lisinopril , premarin 0.625, omeprazole, valacyclovir, d-amphetamine salt.  On 05-Mar-2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 027A21A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced swelling in her arm, . arm red, white dot big as dime solid white, tongue swelling, pain all the way down to arm , fingers cramping up, flu like symptoms.  On 07-Mar-2021 the patient reported to the hospital, was evaluated by a physician who took blood and advised her to go home and take diphenhydramine. Treatment details included tylenol and benadryl.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, tongue swelling,white dot big as dime solid white,fingers cramping up, flu like symptoms, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site erythema and vaccination site pain, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

After about 6 hours after that took more Benadryl and the the next 2 days just as needed about every 8 to 10 hours   Started  chills with highest temperature was  99.4.  K Legs felt heavy the morning after the vaccine and  I felt very tired with some short bursts of Nausea

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

                                                After receiving my shot on Friday, my arm began to get sore, my ears felt like they were on fire.  I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 I felt a little strange.  Just not myself. A little dizzy.  Went to work overnight.  Got up at 5 am Friday, Jan 8, 2021.  Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

                                                Almost immediately after receiving the vaccine, I felt a headache, throat scratchiness, numbness to fingers on right hand and discomfort at injection site. Within 2 hours, I could not continue to work and went home. Took motrin at home and rested.  The following morning  the headache was mild but the injection site was very painful. No reddness or swelling, not firm but extremely tender to touch. Pain at injection site was present for 2 days then resolved slowly..

                                                I experienced what I would describe as a minor localized reaction. The symptoms I noted on Friday after the vaccine was an itchy sensation and under left arm lymph node tenderness on the side of injection. The area was red firm to touch and approx. 3 inches circular around the injection site.  The symptoms are slowly resolving with the redness/itchiness and firmness at the site. Lymph Node tenderness is resolved.

                                                Approx. 12:30am I awoke to a leg cramp. I arose from bed and stood up till the cramping muscle relaxed.  Then I walked to the restroom and during the short distance,I felt a sudden &#34;flush&#34;.  Upon entering restroom, I felt I was getting faint.  Feeling that I was about ready to faint, I tried to easily lower myself to the floor without striking my head or body.  Feeling very dizzy and faint, my stomach instantly felt nauseous and then vomited.  After vomiting, I  suddenly started to &#34;shake very violently&#34; (chills?).  The shaking was uncontrollable and went on for approx. 10 -15 min.  I tried to relieve the violent shaking by covering up with bath towels, that I was able to reach from the floor, where I was still sitting; but that did not seem to help.  After I did not feel so faint, I called for help to have my husband help me back into bed to try to warm up.  By that time the shaking (chills) were no longer so severe, and I was gradually able to fall back to sleep with no further problems the remainder of the night.  The following morning, and ever since that night, I have had no other adverse reactions.   For many years, I have received the yearly flu vaccine and have never had any kind of reaction, accept some minor soreness at the injection site (muscle).

Felt swollen, but dont think it was, burning sensation on lateral borders and tip of tongue,extremely dry mouth.  Felt as though it had also been burned, and had a few white spots on tip, reddened borders on lateral aspects also, very scallopededges. Note I do have a fissured tongue but this reaction was unlike any I had ever had from eating certain foods that trigger any tongue response, and had not eaten anything night before to trigger this. Lasted a few days and progressively felt normal after 3-4 days.

She stated that she was dizzy but that she does suffer from vertigo already. She said these symptoms lasted about a week. On the 1/14/21 she was tachycardic, dizzy, weak and she had a raised red rash distal to the site of injection. She went to urgent care and was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic. On 1/17/21 she went back to urgent care since the rash had migrated and appeared patchier than cellulitis. Her doctor said that he did not believe it to be cellulitis at this time and prescribed her a steroid cream.

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included hypertension, sulfonamide drug allergy, and penicillin drug allergy. Concomitant medications reported included bisoprolol, telmisartan, vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc.   On 30 Dec 2020, approximately four hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot Number: 025J20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Dec 2020, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced warmth, redness, and pain in the arm which she treated with ice and diphenhydramine.  On 31st Dec 2020, 14 hours after vaccine administration, the patient started to experience bullous eruption on her arm, pruritis and constant burning sensation in the arm. She reported having swelling extended down to her arm, bruising, discoloration, blisters, small vesicular pustules, erythema down to the side of the arm, and demarcation. She spoke to her primary care provider as her rash continued to evolve. She was started on a methylprednisolone pack but only took two doses for concern it would blunt the immune response to the vaccine. Additionally, she was treated with triamcinolone ointment.  On 03 Jan 2021, the bullous eruptions peeled off with sloughed skin, she had an excoriated area underneath the skin. She also had tenderness and pain in the arm which resolved spontaneously. The patient self-treated the events with benzethonium chloride and vitamin E oil.  On 28th Jan 2021, the patient had hyperpigmentation of her posterior arm with an excoriated area.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, bullous eruption on her arm, bruising, discoloration, blisters, vesicular pustules, significant pruritus, hyperpigmentation, constant burning sensation, arm felt warm, bullous eruption eventually peeled off with &#34;sloughed skin&#34;, redness down to side of the arm and demarcation, looks like a burn, her arm felt warm, painful and was red, and swelling extended down to her arm, was not reported. The outcome of the event, sloughed skin, was considered recovering. The outcome of the events, significant tenderness and pain on arm/significant tenderness and pain and swelling extended down to her arm, was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 63 year old female patient with medical history of hypertension, sulfonamide drug allergy, and penicillin drug allergy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Dermatitis bullous and NS unexpected events of bruising, discoloration, blisters, vesicular pustules, significant pruritus, hyperpigmentation, constant burning sensation, sloughed skin and arm felt warm. The events occurred 14 hours after first dose of the study medication administration. She was started with a methylprednisolone pack and triamcinolone ointment.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA,      My legs were getting sore and tired at work. I sat down to tie my shoe and noted Pitting &#43; 3 or 4 edema to BIL Calves.  Redness , warmth in a few areas.  R leg 1&#34; larger than L.  Then  I mentioned it to another nurse and  she said it could be side affect of Norvasc.  I spoke with my PA about it on 2/12 she D&#39;C&#39;d Norvasc and perscribed  Nefidepine 30 mg ER. I have not taken it yet I am monitoring my BP and it is WNL.   The edema less in calves however continues in ankles.  I have gotten MULTIPLE broken capillaries all over my legs.          Long short it has to be a reaction to vaccine.  And it continues almost 2 months after injection.   I can&#39;t wear most of my socks.  It is BAD.

It should have been up near the shoulder, but instead the person gave it to me down toward the middle of my arm. I knew something was wrong immediately because it felt so warm and disruptive. The doctor on the scene said it was nothing. Nine days later I went to Urgent Care with swelling, hot-to-the-touch, itchy and a huge knot. The Urgent Care Dr. gave me a five-day prescription for Prednisone and also gave me a prescription for hydroXYzine pamoate, which is an antihistimine.

I was taken to a room and had vitals and was hypertensive and tachycardic with a worsening headache, I was given 50 mg Benadryl and put ice on my face and neck for about 20 minutes as I felt I was burning up. I remained at the clinic for an hour for monitoring. I never had difficulty breathing , and it was mostly resolved in about 45 minutes except for the mild headache and my face was still red and my eyes were swollen for at least an hour.

I spoke to the nurse who hooked me up to bp machine. O2 sat was fine at 98. BP was 158/110, pulse rate was 157. Normal values for me are bp 120/70, pulse 80. BP started to go down and several minutes later another flush happened and bp and pulse rate went back up. Dropped again then third flush with increased bp and pulse happened. After this vitals went back to normal and didn&#39;t happen again. I subsequently developed a pounding headache which lasted until the next morning. Arm was sore as expected. BP that night was normal and the next morning normal. No further adverse effects noted other than fatigue.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min. Within 5 mins, heat rose up to my head causing dizziness &amp; head spin. Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

                                                Adverse event: Face swelling especially the eyes (eye lids, tissue between nose and eyes and below eyes), lips and outside the lips (left upper lip and into cheek and lower right lip into chin). Note: I was not having any trouble breathing and I did not think my throat was closing up.  Treatment: Benadryl 50 mg immediately and again 4 hours later,  Allegra 180mg once daily for 7-10 days, Methylprednisolone 4mg Dospak 21S, Famotidine 20mg 1 twice/day for 10 days. Outcome: Spoke to MD about 8PM on 1/19/21; took first dose of Benadryl and Allegra about 8:20PM; MD called in other Rxs and I had to pick them up, so first doses of methylprednisolone and famotidine were taken around 9:05PM; around 10PM or a bit after MD checked on me and I said I thought the lip swelling was improving but it was hard to tell with the eyes; MD had previously instructed me to stay up to 12:30PM in order to take the second dose of Benadryl 50mg, which I did and then I went to bed. In the morning around 9AM, I thought the face swelling had gone down 40-50%. MD called me around 9:16AM and I reported to her that the swelling had gone down 40-50%.  At 10:36PM tonight as I make this report, my swelling as gone down more maybe by an additional 10 or 15%.

                                                The afternoon after I developed chills and had goose bumps all over.  I didnt have a fever but the chills went on for several hrs so I took 2 500mg tylenol and the chills ended around 5pm.  I developed a headache and still had to continue to drink plenty water because my mouth got that super dry feeling again.  I went home ate and relaxed until I fell asleep.  I had body aches and because my arm was hurting I couldnt lay on that side.  I took benedryl and tylenol before bed. Today I still feel very very tired, fatigued and my body still aches.  My arm is still really red, warm to the touch and has a nice knot at the injection site and the headache comes and goes.

                                                Part of the vaccine ran out at time of injection.  The night of the injection my arm started itching.  I was awakened at 4;00 a.m. the next morning with a very stiff, sore, cramping arm.  I had the normal reactions: slight headache, low temp, itchy, swollen, hot red arm, but very stiff and sore. This lasted 3-4 days with the most noticeable reaction being the sore arm from shoulder to elbow.  On Feb 10, one week later, my arm started itching again in the afternoon and by evening was swollen, red, hot, and hurting  just like the first 3-4 days or slightly worse.  It gradually got better after 4-5 days, returning to normal by 2/20.  The only other symptom the second time were blisters on my left hand above my pointer finger and ring finger.  I&#39;m not sure if they were related or not since I walk outside or if I may have been exposed to poison ivy since the blisters looked similar.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, pneumonia (had from Dec 2020 to Feb 2021 and had &#34;compromised lungs&#34;), allergies to penicillin and sulfa drugs, vitamin D deficiency, pseudobulbar effect, and traumatic brain injury (with swelling on back of brain stem, memory loss, problems with speech). Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium, vitamin C, vitamin D, fish oil, tizanidine, and fluvoxamine.     On 18 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number:029L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 18 Feb 2021, after receiving mRNA-1273 the patient reported to have a severe reaction to the vaccination. The patient had swelling at injection site which looked like a bee sting and felt hot.   On 19 Feb 2021, the patient reported to experience swelling and very bad pain in left hand. The patient took Benadryl as a treatment.   On 20 Feb 2021, terrible pain in arm was reported along with swelling. She went urgent care and they sent her to the hospital, where she stayed for about 8 hours.  Test showed a severe inflammatory reaction.  She also had headaches, her body was in a weakened state, pain went up her arm, she had a rapid heartbeat and a fever.  The patient&#39;s blood pressure was 289/89 and they &#34;thought she was going to have a stroke or a heart attack&#34; because her blood pressure was so high.    Treatment for the events included steroids and unspecified painkillers.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.    The outcome of the events peripheral swelling was considered to be not resolved at the time of reporting.  The outcome of the events of  severe reaction,  swelling and warmth at vaccination site, pain in the arm, inflammation, rapid heartbeat, blood pressure was 286/89/blood pressure was so high, fever, headache, and weakened body state was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

And eyes started feeling puffy especially my left one but when I looked in the mirror nothing was swollen.  About 30 minutes later I took a Benadryl.   It started feeling better but the sensation took about 24 hours to go away totally on my face and a few hours later for my eyes to feel normal.

                                                Approximately 20 to 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I had what appeared to be a seasonal allergic reaction, in which I could not stop sneezing and my eye tearing.  This continued throughout the evening and night but not as intense as when it first began.  I awoke at 1:00 AM to a very intense sneezing and eye tearing, but on only the left side of my face and eventually both sides.  I took Allegra D and did get relief.  The sneezing (allergic rhinitis) reaction continued but after almost an hour of taking the Allegra D , it was not as intense.  My face also appeared swollen but only with respect of atypical allergic rhinitis intense reaction.

Started overnight after day of vaccination and has continued for over 24 hours and has not yet resolved although frequency has started to diminish as of 48 hours.  Also visibly flushed face/hot flashes, slight rise in temperature at 98.4 (over my normal baseline of 97.5) this morning which has since receded.  Waiting to see how long this lasts.

                                                About five days after vaccine administration I noticed an inflammation of the area of the achilles tendon of left foot. Since I am not prone to inflammation of any sort nor did I have any strain or trauma, I took notice. I do not CHF (causing swelling of the ankles). The area of inflammation is tender, a bit red and a bit swollen. It is worrisome since I have never had anything like this in the past. I WILL NEED FOLLOW UP ON THIS. I AM UNSURE IF I SHOULD RECEIVE THE SECOND VACCINE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF SIMILAR INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES HAVE BEEN REPORTED, WHETHER IN ANKLE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BODY.  I realize that this may not be a typical vaccine reaction BUT this is a brand new vaccine, has not been time-tested, is only permitted by the FDA to be administered under these emergency circumstances. SO all possible reactions must be taken seriously and recorded. We are the guinea pigs. Also. I was handed a packet of papers when I received the vaccine. To register for v-safe the only two options given for registration were smart phone browser or QR code. I do not have a cell phone. So this leaves me out of the loop, which I think is unfair and unwise. Why can computer registration not be made available, and if it can then why doesn&#39;t the instruction sheet tell of this? In rural areas not everyone has a cell phone nor is cell service available to all areas.

It took a couple of hours for it to come down to normal. Went to sleep and woke up BP normal and a slight headache.  My arm was sore lasting about 3 days.

                                                Arm soreness noted on Jan. 5. On Jan. 11 I was sneezing a lot with a runny nose. This last for 24 hrs. On the 12th I noticed a raised area in the injection site. I took an Advil .  On the 13th my arm started getting hard near the injection site with some redness. On that day I took a Benadryl once and Advil BID. Today the arm is very hard, red and is warm to the touch. My temp is 100.2. I took 80 mg ASA and a hour later took an Advil.  I reported all my Sx w/ Moderna. They recommended that I call my PMD for Tx. I contacted my PMD and the health department for treatment and they referred me to CDC. No treatment was suggested or given

The redness went down my arm to my inner elbow down my forearm to my wrist. The redness going down my arm was not as bad after I took the Allegra.  It was all extremely painful. I had to go see Dr. because the itching was so bad. Dr. prescribed medicine for the swelling/itching.  At times my throat was sore and my face was flushed and I had a tightness in my chest. But that did not last long.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

Went to the doctors when they opened on Tuesday January 19 and he confirmed I was have an autoimmune response to shot and gave me medication to help with the swelling.  It has been one week and I feel worse every day since the shot not better.

Was 3 inches by two inches. The arm is now back to normal.  .2. Day 8.  Woke at roughly midnight with extreme heat and burning in all toes.  Quite painful.  Very unusual, as I have never experienced anything like this before.  When pain and burning became overwhelming I took Tylenol.  It helped and I was able to sleep.   The next morning the pain and burning were gone but my toes were, and continue to be quite numb, as is the area of my feet that surrounds my toes.  I can&#39;t fully feel my socks, shoes, sheets, etc.  It feel like I have cotton stuffed in my shoes.  It is hard for me to related the level of heat, burning and pain that happened.  I felt like I could melt a block of ice with my feet.  It was severe. I marked &#34;disability or permanent damage&#34; below because I don&#39;t know if the nerves in my feet will return to normal.

It only lasted a few minutes.   About after an hour of being home, I had an issue swallowing only once.   I don&#39;t know if adverse reaction, or panic attack.  I have my 2nd dose schedule for the beginning of Feb  I will let them know what happened.   Also, quarter size red spot on right arm.   It hurt when touched.   Lasted a couple days.

                                                starting February 5, I had mild swelling in the entire left leg treated with ice and anti-inflammatories. There was no redness, swelling, or pain at injection site. Symptoms seemed to be slowly subsiding. However, Thursday 2/11/21, I had a small patch of itchy, (but not painful) red rash on back of left thigh. By Thursday evening it had doubled in size. Friday am (2/12/21) it was a little bigger still. Then by Friday after work, my entire left leg was moderate to severely swollen and the rash covered a large part of the back of right thigh and was beginning to spread to the back of left calf.  Friday evening, I visited Urgent Care. The doctor there was concerned about a possible DVT and sent me to the ER. At ER, an ultrasound revealed no DVT. At no time did I have a fever. The ER doctor admitted me to the hospital where I remained until the afternoon of Monday, February 15. During hospital stay, I was treated with IV Vancomycin twice per day. That helped quite a bit to reduce rash and swelling but it remains at a mild level. I am currently Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. I took the first dose of the oral med at the hospital on the day of discharge.

                                                ?Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA? About a week after my first dose (only immediate side effect, about 12 hours after shot, was stiff left arm/shoulder for about 3 days), I had the WORST genital herpes attack that I&#39;ve had in literally 40 years, with extremely swollen labia, excessively &#34;weeping&#34; sores, intense itching and pain. The shot was the only variable in my routine health and healthcare to which I can attribute this; the herpes attack finally began to heal, but then repeated itself, not as bad as the first one. During this time I have been taking Valcyclovir and Acyclovir cream, prescribed by OB/GYN. A few days into the initial herpes attack, my hands and face swelled and broke out in a case of (probably) dermatitis (which I&#39;ve had once or twice in the last 2 years), covering my arms, legs, hands, somewhat belly and back, with itchy hives which are still healing. Was prescribed by dermatologist Hydroxyzine HCL 10 MG 3x/day &#43; Triamcinolone Acetonide lotion USP 0.025% topical ointment, which are helping to relieve itching.

The size of the rash was approximately 6 x 4 inches.   The itching subsided in approximately 48 hours but it was 9 days before the swelling and the rash finally improved.

This was  accompanied by a prickling sensations.  I got a sore inside my right nostril and a cold sore on right upper lip.  The mottling and vein prominence continue intermittently still.  Improving but not resolved entirely. Along with this, my eyes became intermittently  itchy as if I had an allergic irritation. This has also completely resolved.  I spoke with a relative who is a physician  and he felt that I may have had a hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis reaction.

This time had low grade fever (100.1), body aches, sore neck, joint aches in hands, minor headache, chills from fever.  Also injection site redness, which extended out for a few inches around the injection site itself.  This lasted about 3 or 4 days and was warm to the touch.  The fever etc. only lasted the one day (day after injection) and by day three I was fine.  Was not servere enough to keep me from working etc., but I did go to bed early that night.

                                                About 6 PM the day I received the vaccine, the arm started to become extremely sore. It was achy feeling and it radiated down to my wrist. This lasted until Sunday and it started to fade. Today it is just some soreness left at the injection site. I was taking OTC Acetaminophen 500MG between 100 MG for pain. It was difficult to sleep due to the pain. I was also putting cool compresses on it.  The pain worse when I was trying to clean my car and shovel the snow. However the cold compress and stretching did help with some of the pain. I also felt agitated for different periods times after vaccination, I felt like my hormones were out of whack and I wanted to &#34;bite someone&#39;s head off&#34; this lasted for about an 1 hour or so. I also had mild headaches.

                                                I woke up Saturday morning 2/20/2021 - 9 days after vaccination #1 - and noticed my left arm was bright red, slightly swollen, tender but not painful, and itching like crazy.  It appears the name for that is now, Covid arm.  Today, 2/23/2021, the redness is fading and it is only slightly itchy.    Very mild tenderness when I touch it.  Checked my temp over the last few days and it was in the normal range 97.4-97.9 (for me).

                                                I was experiencing a mild RA flare w/ tendinitis going into the vaccine sequence. After 2nd dose my flare worsened to severe within a 9 day period. I had joint, muscle pain, swelling of fingers, hands. I lost much mobility, having gait issues and could not walk unaided ( a first in a flare). I do not take immunosuppressive infusions. Just NSAIDs. My doctor  prescribed a week of Prednisone. I am improving but having to build up strength to stand and walk. My flare continues but is abated. My muscles are weak.

                                                starting February 5, I had mild swelling in the entire left leg treated with ice and anti-inflammatories. There was no redness, swelling, or pain at injection site. Symptoms seemed to be slowly subsiding. However, Thursday 2/11/21, I had a small patch of itchy, (but not painful) red rash on back of left thigh. By Thursday evening it had doubled in size. Friday am (2/12/21) it was a little bigger still. Then by Friday after work, my entire left leg was moderate to severely swollen and the rash covered a large part of the back of right thigh and was beginning to spread to the back of left calf.  Friday evening, I visited Urgent Care. The doctor there was concerned about a a possible DVT and sent me to the ER. At ER, an ultrasound revealed no DVT. At no time did I have a fever. TheER doctor admitted me to the hospital where I remained until the afternoon of Monday, February 15. During hospital stay, I was treated with IV Vancomycin twice per day.  That helped quite a bit to reduce rash and swelling but it remains at a mild level. I am currently Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. I took the first dose of the oral med at the hospital on the day of discharge.

                                                While driving home after leaving facility 15 minutes after shot, I started having an increased heart rate.  Once home, the rapid heart rate continued and I noticed throat swallowing was getting a little tighter.  I started drinking water and just breathed normally sitting down.  I went to a mirror to see if I could see any swelling of my face and noticed my neck right under my chin was red about half way down.  My chest seemed fine.  I continued to just sit &amp; drink water and soon the heart rate was getting back to normal.  I noticed the redness on my neck was getting lighter also.  I looked at my watch and it had been a little over an hour since my vaccination.  I did not seek treatment, nor have I called my doctor.  There have been no more adverse reactions.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

Started as a few red pimples but became red all over and swollen (possible hives?). Later in evening swollen lymph node (about 1)2 inch diameter) under chin near left ear. Felt very tender. Lymph node swelling reduced by next morning. Rash at injection remained. Has diminished in color but is still pink thru today 02/22/2021 and no more itch.  Took no action at all. Notified primary care physician Thurs 02/18/2021. Note that on Friday 02/12/2021 (prior to rash appearing) started prescription prilosec 40 mg 1 per day. Continued this thru Thurs 02/18/2021.  Discontinued prilosec after speaking with primary care physician. Don&#39;t know if this had anything to do with reaction.

                                                When I first got the vaccine I was fine but as the day went on I felt soreness in my left arm with some stiffness in my neck. Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

I took Ibuprofen, rested, had lots of liquids, and was fine the day after (01/01/2021) No other symptoms until exactly one week later (01/06/2021). I noticed the injection site on my left arm was itching and a bit sore. A 5&#34;x3&#34; red rash appeared at injection site. I took one Acetaminophen PM that night. The red rash is still there. These appear to be minor reactions but the red rash is never one I have had before with any vaccinations. It seems strange it didn&#39;t appear until a week later. No difference in skin lotion I have used. I wanted to report effects for data collection purposes since it is a new/emergency vaccine.

It was definitely swollen and some redness too. I took my temperature and had no fever. Called my doctor&#39;s office to report my findings. Was instructed to apply a cold ice pack on it and take ibuprofen and to contact you with my event. I did not need to visit the office and continuing to ice pack my arm and ibuprofen.  As of 3:41 pm CST it is still swollen.

                                                After receiving vaccination mid day Monday, I awoke Friday morning with slight swelling on right upper lip and surrounding cheek area. Thinking I had slept in an odd position, I went about my business. At noon, I realized that it had not gotten any better, By 3PM it was clearly more involved. I took 2 benedryl tablets.  By abour 6:30 swelling was increasing, Visited facility and Urgent Care where I was given Dexamethasone 10 mg injection IM. Prescribed Predisone 20 mg tablet x2 daily for 5 days. Most swelling resolved by Saturday morning, but slight swelling is presisting so far.

                                                When my fingers touched something cold they would feel weird and lose their color. The first time (1/21) was minor (one finger) and the second time was (1/23) and all the tips of my fingers of my right hand turned colorless when I touched something cold. 1/24 my toes tingled when I walked and happens when I go for a walk. The finger symptom seems to be diminishing. I have never had either of these things happen before I had the Moderna vaccine. My doctor told me not to have the second dose which is due on 1/30/2021.

While driving home my face became warm, after arriving home face/cheeks extremely red/flushed.  Have a picture taken at 3:54 for documentation. Not sure if from anxiety, but felt jaw tightness and a thick tongue.  No itching, swallowing problems etc.   lasted approximately 15 minutes. By 4:57 pm redness had faded.   Picture documentation. 9:15 pm had right ear pain and mild reddened of right cheek.   Picture documentation.

Per the daughter, the patient started feeling ill on 1/21, improved on 1/25, and then acutely worsened on 1/27, resulting in the ED visit.

Occasional tingling, angioderma around mouth. Disssapated after Benadryl.  Rash is gradually fading and requires less Benadryl to keep in check.  Had similar reaction to Shrinyx vaccine 2 years ago.  Rash lasted 1-2 weeks without Benadryl treatment.

On Jan 27th (7 days following vaccination) a large (2.5&#34; X 4&#34;) red area formed around the injection site on my arm and it began to ache and itch. I also had diarrhea which began in the middle of the night (2 am on Jan 28), with a total of 3 episodes over 3 hours. That day I was very tired, experienced intestinal upset  (w/ very small episodes of diarrhea) and my arm began to really ache and the swollen area became rather firm and hot. The intestinal episode is over but the hot red welt continues as of this report. Diarrhea is not a common condition for me.

On 2/16/21 noticed a red hive like rash at the injection site that extended down to the  inside of my arm. No bumps, not itching,  just a red patch about the size of a half of chicken breast.  Applied Triamcinolone cream to the site. Saw Dr. on 2/17/21  and she said to monitor and apply the Triamcinolone cream.  If it worsened we may treat it as a skin infection.  The redness  lessened over the next few days and was gone by 2/21/21

                                                I received my Covid-19 Moderna vaccine on February 12. Soon afterward, the pharmacy called and told me that they had accidently given me a double dose. They reported it to my primary care physician and both the pharmacy and my doctor stayed in close contact with me to monitor my health. I had the usual sore arm, a headache, and a little achy that evening, but nothing major. I noticed the next day that I had a hard lump about 3.5 inches below where my shot was given (not directly below, more toward the inside of my arm.) A small rash begin to develop, but after a few days the rash was gone, but the lump remained. Twelve days after my shot, the lump became very red and hot. The rash appeared again and basically moved up my arm. I kept putting a cortisone itch cream on it, but it was very uncomfortable. Two days after the rash appeared I became quite sick with what it felt like side effects ? chills that included violent shaking and temperature that reached 100.5. I had that for about 24 hours. Now the lump on my arm is gone, I no longer have rash, and my temperature is back to normal. I feel tired today, but probably because of the previous day?s temps and chills. I find it interesting that 2 weeks after my shot I would have those kind of reactions (unless this had nothing to do with the shot?)  I thought you might want to have this data, as it is an interesting side effect. My doctor wasn?t sure how to explain it either. I would be interested to see if others that might have gotten an overdose of the shot experienced anything similar.

                                                Within 24 hours of injection, the left arm became very red below the injection site, and after five days the redness had traveled down to the elbow.  The arm was also distinctly warm to the touch and tender.  During the first evening, I experienced chills and presumed fever that responded to 400 mg of Ibuprofen.  I experienced some nausea, loss of appetite, and malaise over the next three to four days after injection.

After 2 hours I got up and felt okay.

                                                Began experiencing itchy ankles on Thursday, 1/7/21, afternoon.  Itching got worse overnight and awoke to find numerous raised red spots over my legs, thighs, and lower back. Spots became more numerous and pronounced through Friday, 1/8/21, and itching became nearly unbearable causing me to make deep scratches on the bac of my legs. Spots continued to spread and become more pronounced throughout the weekend. There have been no other notable symptoms. The itchiness is horrible and only occasionally becomes bearable for a short time - usually after taking Benadryl at bedtime.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

                                                Sent: 3/4/2021   7:55 AM Subject: Non-Urgent Medical Question                    For a full week now, I have been battling diarrhea and a very hyperactive stomach and intestines. Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).

Treated with tylenol, motrin, and heat and pain eventually dissipated. Then Tuesday and Wednesday pt did a lot of yard work and lifting. Thursday patient woke up with excruciating right flank pain.  Nothing has made it better.  Patient has tried ice, heat, tramadol Tylenol, Motrin, steroids and pain persists.  Additionally patient having nausea and vomiting.  She has started to have burning with urination.  Pain is excruciating stabbing.  Radiates to the groin.  Patient has also started running fevers today.  She feels pretty miserable.   Also patient notes difficulty with her bowels since her last surgery.  Prior to surgery she took Linzess every day.  Since surgery it has been suggested she does not need this medication.  Patient does note little to no notice when her bowels decide to move.  Severe significant gas.  Other times patient feels quite constipated.   UA suggests possible infection with positive nitrites, 1&#43; leukocyte esterase and 3&#43; blood.

I also became exhausted.  I realized I had been tired much of the first day but once my arm became so painful, I was completely exhausted.  I felt out of sorts for about  36 hours and then began to feel normal again.  It probably took a few more days to regain my energy completely.

I received my vaccine on 1.06.2021.

Saw my primary physicia and she was unsure what was happening. We agreed to monitor the arm and call if it got worse or I had other symptoms. The following two days found the red rash becoming more of a bulls eye. The outer ring was red with the inner bulls eye brown, same coloring as a birthmark. The upper arm continues to ache, but swelling is down and today, Monday, January 25, it is still discolored, but brown rather than red.

I took a photo of the injection site which has a red circle the size of my hand.

                                                I had a possible reaction on my Left arm and chest. My Right arm received the injection. I never have any sticks in my left arm since I have  developed Lymphedema post breast cancer mastectomies and treatment in  April 2006. When I arose  my effected arm was red in color, with a rash on top of that. It was hot to the touch and swollen and stiff.  My husband took me to the emergency room of the hospital named in Item 21 and later that day I was admitted to the hospital. They diagnosed it as a severe infection, resulting in cellulitis and started me on round the clock IV antibiotics.

                                                Arm burning at site and achy, malaise, Sunday I work up and my face felt hot and cheeks red and felt swelling, my cheek and neck and felt like it was going into my nose and up to my eyes, and I had hoarseness as well.  I had difficulty breathing so I went to the ER. I was given an IV and they observed me.

                                                Patient was waiting out her 15 mins in the waiting room after receiving the first dose of her Moderna COVID19 vaccine when she began to fill like her tongue was a little swollen. Brought patient into an exam room and took her vitals at 1028 which were BP 135/83, HR 82, O2 96%, and RR 15. Also looked at patients throat to assess signs of angioedema or restricted airway. Patients tongue did appear swollen and was unable to clearly see the back of her throat. 1020 IM Benadryl 50mg was given per standing order and retook vitals at 1032 vitals remained stable at BP 131/52, HR 79, and O2 96%. Patient was moved to a more private room and laid down on a yoga matt for 15-20 min. She began to feel better and continued to be able to swallow and maintain airway. Tongue swelling does appear to have decreased. Could not see uvula but patient states she is not sure if you ever can she may have different anatomy. Vital taken for final time around 1100 and were BP 125/76 O2 96% and HR 74 which she says is normal for her. Made patient aware that after her husband drives her home that she should monitor symptoms and if they become worse she needs to call 911. Scheduled second dose of vaccine but told her to anticipate getting vaccine in Urgent care if okay with Director.

                                                The day after the injection ( January 8) I had a very sore left arm, fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches.  During the next week I had occasional fever and chills , fatigue and muscle aches.   On January 14, my  upper left arm began itching and swelling.  This has continued including the entire upper arm becoming very hot to the touch.  It has subsided somewhat by January 17.  Should I get the second dose scheduled for Feb 4?

On 01/24/2021 roughly at 04:45 A.M., I began to chill/shiver.  The injection site on my right arm had become hot to the touch, peppered with red blotches, swollen and began to hurt again.  I did take 1000mg of Tylenol for discomfort.  I felt flushed, but no fever to speak of, rather lethargic.  Today, 01/25/2021, the injection site is one large reddened, hot, swollen area about a size 3x4 inches.  At this time, I have not visited my physician or any Urgent Care.

Used Benadryl to stop itching so not to scratch.  Lasted about 4-5 days but did not think much about it until I read where several people had the same symptoms, but only happened in primarily women 30-40 years of age.  Thought you may be interested as I am 70.

                                                Red rash that started out about a 2 inch square (about 10 days from when I got the vaccine) that kept growing to wrap around half of my upper arm.  It itched some, and was warm to the touch.  On day  14, after discussion with Dr., he thought it was a skin infection, so prescribed antibiotics (Cephalexin 500 MG Capsules taken 3 times a day), which I started taking on day 14.  By Day 18 the rash has calmed down, not as red or visible,  but still there.  This was for the Moderna vaccine.

                                                A 70 y/o female who presented to Urgent Care for arm pain (left arm was swollen, itch and redness after getting COVID vaccine 8 days ago).  At the initial visit, the provider thought the patient had cellulitis.  Therefore a course of 7 days of Keflex was given. Patient finished her antibiotic and those symptoms still persisted. She came back to her primary care with still mild erythema and warmth of the left lateral arm.  At this time, her doctor diagnosed her with a local reaction to the COVID vaccine  and the patient was sent home with triamcinolone which she had.

                                                After first vaccination on Jan. 11th, 2021 I had muscle weakness in legs lasting only about an hour. I just didn?t feel right. After one hour I was fine.  Second vaccine was administered on Feb. 8th at noon. By 3:30 AM Feb 9th I could barely get out of bed because of severe joint pain and aching. I was nauseated, had a mild fever, mild headache and very tired. This lasted until  February the 10th at which time I felt better. By Feb. 11th I had return of deep aching pain in my hips and pelvic bones. ( I have arthritis and know what joint pain is). This was much worse. I felt ill from about one week after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna. I started feeling much better with the occasional return of mild symptoms.  I go to physical therapy for arthritis pain and had taken a week off. I returned to physical therapy on Thursday. February 18th. I was unable to complete my usual workout due to weakness in my legs and joint pain. I returned on Feb. 22nd and the same thing happened I felt weak, diaphoretic, nauseated,  after exercising a short time. This has never happened before.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First symptoms appeared about 8PM the evening of the shot - a feeling of being weighted down, with extra difficulty in moving about.  I went to bed early and when I woke up I had a fever of 101.5 accompanied by chills, body aches, nausea, fatigue, brain fog, and headache.  Over the course of two days, my temperature ranged from 101.5 to 103.  After two days my fever broke during the night.   I did not want to take fever reducing medication in case it interfered with the immune response, but I did take 1 dose each of Tylenol and Motrin over the course of the 2 days.  Still felt a bit sluggish on the 3rd day and continue to have brain fog 6 days later.

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

                                                She felt. Ad the evening of her 2nd vaccine.  The morning after she felt worse.  Nauseous, pale, achy. She said she had not ever felt that bad. I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

I felt not myself after reaching the lobby and sat a little while there. Once home took tylenol and rested for while woke with horrible headache including the next day.

Each day after the initial discovery,  the rash grew larger and the pain and heat grew in  intensity.  I iced my arm and took 3 Advil.  As of today the swelling has subsided.  The redness now  is across the entire front of my arm but the pain no longer prevails.

                                                On the first day of the injection (1/14/2021) the left arm was sore and I felt tired. Towards evening and during the night I felt cold and hot at the same time - an intense burning/freezing sensation, but no sweating. On the first day after the injection (1/15/201) the arm was still sore and I still felt tired - burning/freezing sensation had ceased. On the second day after the injection (1/16/2021) the left arm was not sore and I felt better, but at 11:00 a.m. the vein in the left temple burst and bled until about 6:00 p.m. Continuous throbbing pain across the forehead the entire day. The  middle of the forehead is covered with red dots; the area near the left eye has a number of open, bloody lesions; the area below the temple (left cheek) is black and blue. There are also two bright red spots on my left knee - but no bleeding. Nausea was slight, but present during the entire day on Saturday and Sunday. Since the hospitals have Covid 19 patients and I do not have a car, I stayed home and rested in bed.  Today on Sunday (1/17/2021) I can sit up and walk around somewhat; the throbbing pain in the head has ceased. The lesions are still vivid red , but slowly forming a crust.  Will make contact with my doctor  on Monday, when the office is open.

The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

                                                On day 6 he woke up feeling very weak. Needed help getting out of bed. He has a degenerative muscle disease (Inclusion Body Myositis) so is already very weak, wheelchair bound. House is set up with all lift chairs or elevated (Bed, Toilet) so he can get out of them with very weak legs. By mid morning he was not able to use legs or arms at all to get up and had difficulty holding head up (usually no problem). By afternoon temperature went to 103.6. and he ached all over. After 2 - 3 hours with dose of 2 extra strength Tylenol temperature came down to 100.6 and then another hour later he became very sweaty all over body and temp returned to normal. Continued very weak for a few days. Gradually regained strength and back to normal strength for him over 6 days.

I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

                                                4 days after the vaccine, I had EXCRUCIATING nerve pain, starting at the upper vertabrae and  shooting down both arms to fingertips. Sometimes all the way down my back and the back of my legs.  I vomited all day, had a low fever which  lasted for 24 hours, then the pain and fever subsided. Still have nausea but no more vomiting .  I went to a doctor  after that, he also thinks it was a reaction..  On the 7th day, a purple splotchy rash showed on my skin and my hands started swelling up at night, so painful I couldn&#39;t even pull up the sheet.  The hand swelling goes down during the day and comes back at night.  I plan to get an antibody test  on  Feb. 26.  I am 98% certain that I had COVID in July, it was precisely the same symptoms and I had with the vaccine.  No treatment, just resting tilll it&#39;s over.  I am almost 80% better now, but not completely. I worry that I will never get back to 100%, it&#39;s been  11 days now.

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

There I was given  multiple liters of IV fluids,  IV Zofran and IV Tylenol.   I felt better after treatment but still had the intense headache and ringing in the ears.  The next day, I&#39;m now gradually beginning to feel better, just weak.  I can eat today, two days after the injection and slowly beginning to feel better.   This reaction was terrible for me.

Rash has looked gone and not affected me during part of some days, then will flare up later at night and seems to be in places at times, like legs, other side of my face  and then gone. Not particularly itchy, mostly a feeling of irritation and  rash  on right side of face feels tight, like when you have a sunburn.

                                                4 days after the injection, I felt weary when I woke up that morning.  By 10:00 AM, I had a moderate headache that lasted the rest of the day even though I did take some Ibuprofen.  5 days after, I was extremely fatigued but able to go to work and do my daily activities but went to sleep soon after dinner.  6 days after was a repeat of the extreme fatigue but I did get through my day and went to sleep early.  Day 7, I woke up feeling great and have not had any other symptoms.

Soreness went away and injection site could not be found. 5 days after the shot was administered,, my arm started getting sore and I felt achy.  The 6th day, symptoms got worse, achy and chills, but no fever that I am aware of.  7th day, symptoms persisted but not as bad, except that my arm had swollen up and turned red all the way to my elbow and felt  like a large hard knot.  Today, I am not as achy or chilled, but my arm is still hot, red, and swollen .  The redness is below the injection site, although the injections site looks like a little red pimple, whereas earlier, I couldn&#39;t even find it.

I developed chills and had muscle aches like the flu.  No fever.  The next day, my arm started getting sore below the injection site and itched.  That night, my whole arm was swollen, red,  sore, hot to touch and itched.  The redness extended around my upper arm and down to the elbow.  It had been 8 days since the vaccination and I still have the red itchy arm.

Then 7 days after the vaccine, she experienced severe pruritis that actually woke her from sleep and had been scratching the area. It has now on day 8 become much more indurated and has grown in size, even during today.

I got worried and went to an urgent care clinic where they thought that it was a minor reaction.   I went home and had breakfast and felt much better within 2 hours.  Have felt fine since.

                                                First vaccine digestive symptoms and minor aches; very sore left arm lasted 7 days; 2nd vaccine: 102 degree fever on next day; aches and pains all over; could barely get out of bed; inability to eat at all for 24 hours; digestive symptoms: gas, acid refulx, nausea; giant burps. By next day, very painful electric transitory pains (seconds) in core of my vascular formation in my upper left leg. This is a congenital defect that responds to estrogen, but also some medicines like synthroid, which I do not take after getting reaction with just 3 pills. Successfully moderated Hashimoto&#39;s with strict gluten-free and dairy-free diet. I have never experience such severe leg pain and massive swelling, still happening today. Th The only other time that I have experienced these short intermitent &#34;electric&#34; pains was during infertility treatment at age 40, more than 30 years ago. I suspect something in the adjuvant. I hope that this will exit my body because the sudden swelling and severe pain is not something I can endure. It barely beats dying from Covid-19. My quality of life is wrecked for the time being. I suspect that this vaccine has caused an autoimmune attack on my vascular malformation; that my T cells have gone beserk. I&#39;d be willing to have my antibodies against Covid checked and I&#39;ll bet I have more than average! The havoc for people with autoimmunity and Moderna vaccine is serious. I despair and hope that it won&#39;t have a lasting impact on my health. I will volunteer to be studied, but no more Moderna vaccine for me! I trusted the medical establishment and government and this has not worked out well!

                                                On 01/11/2021, within a few hours of my grandmother getting the shot her injection area became red, swollen and hot to the touch. At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

Applied 2% Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride which helped.  Fever and headache gone and did not return.  Body aches less each day.  1/17?2021 Body aches, arm soreness gone. Itchy rash lighter in color, but remains today as I file this. Not concerned about it. Am sure it will go away soon.

The second ay the itching has dissipated, but the arm is now sore at the injection site and the rash has spread.  The rash is not as red.as it was on 1/19/21.   I have been taking an antihistamine and rubbing hydrocortisone cream on the rash.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

Tight chest with heaviness and shortness of breath, started within 30 minutes and grew more difficulty breathing over each ensuing hour.  Ventolin inhaler and Wyxlela inhaler s used 4 times over recommeded dosage....to no avail. Used nebulizer with Ipratropium Bromide an Albuterol Sulfate..two times over 3 hours.

                                                On Sat morning upon arising and taking a shower I noticed a red line almost welt on my arm by afternoon there were 2 lines and they were getting longer and wider. By Monday morning the area covered with puffiness and redness was about  at least 4 inches wide and going  almost entirely around the arm. It hurt and was very warm to touch along with starting to itch. It was not hard at the\at time. Placed a call to my doctor and was advised to see him or urgent care. I choose the later to do. In checking it out they mentioned that they have been seeing the quite often in the last couple weeks. Take an aspirin, tylenol or ibuprophn  and put cold conpresses on for 20 minutes as often as I can. This morning (Tuesday 23rd of February) it has enlarged again some redness is gone but it apprears to be black and blue now. Still itching, I have not itched it as of yet.

                                                I am not 100% certain of this event being related to the vaccination with the Moderna COVID19 shot or not.  However, in the interest of completeness and for investigative purposes, I am reporting to you the event in relation to the vaccination as the patient reported to me.  She received the vaccination on 2/14/2021 and became very confused.  She had significant left arm swelling much worse than when she had her first vaccination.  Her husband brought her to the emergency room and she was eventually discharged, but she went on to develop significant hypertension and she reported that her blood pressures were normal prior to the vaccination.  She had an emergency room visit in which her systolic pressures were well above 240.  She revisited the emergency room and had elevated blood pressures of 240 and was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy and later found to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES.  We have started the patient on medications, and started laboratory work-up for secondary hypertension and her blood pressures have improved with treatment.  We discussed the case with the neurologist, who suggested that we repeat MRI scan to make sure that her punctate lesions noted on MRI on this admission on 2/25/2021, have resolved.  It was advised that if they had not resolved that we should call neurology again.  Hypertensive encephalopathy is rare and press syndrome as a result is also rare.  It is for this reason that I am reporting this event as again, I am not trying to mislead anyone or distort information, but should this be an adverse effect of the vaccine I wanted to make sure that this was reported as the patient&#39;s history prior to the vaccination and developing this complication post vaccination are temporally related at a minimum.  The patient is a known smoker but quit on the 14th of this month.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included cellulitis.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 19-Feb-2021, approximately 2 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT/BATCH: 016M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On the day of vaccination, the patient reported that her left lower leg turned stop-light red and that it became swollen and itchy. The patient was admitted to the hospital 20-Feb-2021 through 22-Feb-2021 where she was treated with intravenous vancomycin.   Treatment for the event included intravenous vancomycin.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, cellulitis, her left lower leg turned stop-light red, swollen and itchy,  was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 13 Feb 2021, the patient received the first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch# 007M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the night of 13 Feb 20212, the patient experienced arm hurt a little bit and she felt fatigued.  In the early morning of 14 Feb 2021, the patient went to the bathroom.  On her way to the bathroom,  she felt confused and had overwhelming nausea.  She lost consciousness and banged her head on the cabinet.  Within second, she regained consciousness but felt extremely weak.  She could not recall how she got back to her bed.  The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).  The outcome of the events was resolved on 15 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Additional information has been requested.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded

My arm was very swollen, fatigue and bad headache with loud ringing in the head. My blood pressure accelerated  to nearly 200/88 and had to be admitted to the ER three days after shot. I was in the hospital for two days and had a series of CAT scans and ultrasounds.  Loud ringing in my head has not stopped. Never had a history of high blood pressure, but now they put me on high blood pressure medication along with the baby aspirin. I was a relatively healthy woman until I had these vaccinations.

These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

                                                Delayed injection site reaction in vaccine arm. Arm of patient was sore with minimal swelling after vaccination and resolved. 8 days after vaccination, vaccine arm started itching and is red, warm, and swollen (patient estimates the size of an orange). Patient also reports that there are whelps around the injection site. Patient called PCP and was advised to take Benadryl and watch;  if more systemic reactions develop, to seek emergency care.

                                                Red rash on face.  At first, 1/13/21, I didn&#39;t think it was related to the vaccine.  It spread and worsened over the next four days and then the injection site became red also that was when I related it to the vaccine, 1/18/21.  I sent a picture to my doctor, a friend, who retired, and he said to take Benadryl and Pepcid AC, which I did for 3 days (1/18/21 - 1/10/21).  I now have just a little roughness to my face and a very pale red mark by the injection site.

Day 8, arm itchy and red around the injection site.  Warm to the touch. Day 9, more redness and larger area. Size of a silver dollar.  Talked to the nurse at a local gym. Suggested a clinic. I Saw a Nurse Practioner at a clinic. She thought perhaps it was an insect bite as the red area was about 4 inches below where a &#39;normal shot&#39; would be given. Prescribed cream and antibiotic. I didn&#39;t take it.  Took Benadryl (pill). Improving after 1 hr of taking Benadryl.

                                                Got home, after eating dinner felt nauseous on the verge of throwing up, indigestion.  Very tired, and went to bed.  Started feeling sick during the night, knew something was wrong.  Could barely get out of bed, was hot, possibly low grade fever, had chills, was achy, bad headache like you feel when having the flu, weakness.   Took Tylenol and her regular medicines.  Today, 1/29/21 when she woke up still has extreme soreness, hot to touch.  She looked at her left arm and it&#39;s all swollen, red and itchy.  She&#39;s now afraid to go back for the 2nd vaccine.   Caller her pharmacy due to her arm and she was instructed to take Benadryl and Ibuprofen, which she only takes Tylenol.

                                                On Jan 26th when I woke up in the morning I saw that a large portion of my upper left arm was very bright red and over the subsequent 3 days including today the area of redness expanded, got larger. So now the red rash is covering almost my entire upper left arm down to the elbow. And day of onset I had a low grade fever but temp was normal after that. In the center of the rash, there is a darker area that was slightly swollen and the whole area, but especially the darker, area is warm to the touch. I did see the Dr. on Wednesday January 27th and he prescribed Keflex antibiotic which I am still taking.

                                                First Vaccine, no side effects except sore arm for one day and a lot of bruising at injection site which left in 8 days. Vaccine 2 awakened at 2:00 AM in extraordinary pain in my whole body,, dry heaved for 4 hours, sweats and chills, temp only 99 (I usually run 97) Felt sick to stomach rest of  day. Never felt this sick.  By evening it left as quickly as it came.  Was tired for several days but nothing else. On Feb 16th awakened with an very sharp pain in the injection site when I moved my arm up to stretch. This has gotten worse every day. When I move my arm in a certain direction it feels like it is ripping inside. It is not bruised and not painful to the touch. It is inside and in the same location as the injection. Heat and ice make no difference. It seems to be getting more painful and feel it more often. It is painful enough that I let out a yelp when I forget and lift my arm a certain way. As of yesterday I feel it all day, not the sharp pain but more a inside burning, not enough to stop me, but I know it os there.

Red area on sot arm by that evening - next day (2nd day after shot) developed red rashes by  outside of each breast, larger spot by left side (where shot was given), spot on left side of my neck also.  Not a raised or bumpy rash at all, not sore or itchy.    Called advise nurse to determine taking a benedryl was ok and took one last night.  This morning rash less noticeable but still there - also new little mark on inner left elbow.  Feeling fine this whole time, just concerned because I haven?t read of this reaction much for second Moderna.

Blood pressure rose to 170-190 over 110 and would not go down.  Doctor advised I go to the E.R. for assessment, which I did. Blood pressure remained elevated for days . Noted the systolic was higher , mostly in the 80&#39;s.  I do not have hypertension BP this morning  in the 120&#39;s over 70.  Needed Alprazolam to calm my anxiety since.  Not every day. Very concerned about having the second dose. Doctor has advised me to only drink water the day of shot, take a tranquilizer an hour before and has given me BP med to take if my BP goes over 150.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had my first dose of the Moderna Vaccine 1/14 with minor discomfort. On 1/21 area around the site felt itchy. On 1/22 morning I saw large red circle that was slightly sore and hot to the touch. On 1/22 afternoon I called for appointment.  Since none was available I went to urgent care where I was prescribed Doxycycline.  Have been taking it as prescribed and circle has been slowly fading away but is still visible.  I  thought it might have been a reaction to an insect bite, but now a friend who got the vaccine the same day I did is experiencing the same reaction.   I  would like to know if you think this is connected to the vaccine and if so could it affect the efficacy of the vaccine? I am also concerned about taking the second dose.

Over the next three days the redness moved down my arm, covering an area of 6 inches and nearly all the way around my arm.  The arm was stiff and painful and hot to the touch.  On Monday,  1/25/21, I contacted my primary care doctor.

It itches, is red, but other than the itch it has not bothered me at this point.  I went to a walk-in clinic and was told it could be cellulitis. (bacteria) at the injection site.  He has placed me on an antibiotic starting today.  The rash, swelling on my arm, is hot to the touch and I prefer non-one touch it.  The physician at the walk in said to add heat to the site.  I have also gotten a cough.   He prescribed something for this also.  My Covid case was very mild.

                                                Yesterday 2/21/21 started having itching on her arm, round area when she looked in the mirror at the time of her vaccine.  Area is warm, very itchy and 1 1/2&#34; x 1 1/2&#34; in size.  The area is also red today, intensely itchy.  Did put cortisone cream on it yesterday, which didn&#39;t make it go away, possibly reduced the itching some, but not much.  She does also have a headache today.  She takes a lot of vitamins, and has not taken anything else for the reactions.

Pts doctor sent her for mammo and sonogram test for the swollon lymph nodes.  Pts doctor let her know that these symptoms were directly related to taking the Covid Vax.  Pt states that the swelling is not completely gone but it is smaller and getting better.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine she felt a tingling/little something going down into her hand, but she did not think about it being the shot and did not report it.  Then went home, took a Tylenol and that afternoon her arm was sore like the normal reaction.  She went to bed, woke up at 1:00 AM and her arm was killing her/hurting.  She got up and went to the bathroom and noticed that her hand was swollen and the veins on the top of her hand were protruding.  She looked in the mirror and noticed that the left side of her neck was swollen.  Then she took her temperature and it was elevated, her normal is 97 and it was 99.  Later on that day on Saturday the inflammation got better.  She did not take anything for it.   The symptoms have progressively gotten better and now her hand is normal, her neck this morning looked normal and her temperature is back to her baseline.
