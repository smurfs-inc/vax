                                                I got the shot, didn?t feel it at all so it went good. I went to the bathroom and went pee and got my arm back in my long sleeve shirt under my scrub top. I wasn?t anxious about getting the vaccine. Then I went to sit down and be monitored. After about another minute I felt very weird like a warm feeling going all over my body.  I started pulling my mask away from my face to get a deep breath. Then I broke out in a sweat from head to toe. I think I became pale (I apparently didn?t look good).  I started feeling more ?weird? as I had never felt this way before and I stood up to walk because the nurse there wanted me upstairs near the ED but I was weak so I sat down and had tunnel vision. After that it?s a bit of a blur. After I stopped sweating I got very cold and shaky but vitals were ok.  It scared me because I have never had a reaction before to a vaccine.

After getting the shot, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and drank some water then waited 20 mins. When I left to go back to my department, I started getting dizzy and coughing. I sat down in my department and could not stop coughing so I went to the ER department. My eyes were swollen, I had a rash from my arms and legs all the way down my body. I had hives on my face and my eyes were swollen. I was coughing and wheezing. the ER RN started an IV and I was given steroids, diphenhydramine, ondansetron and IV fluids. I was also given some cough medicine. I was monitored for a few hours and before I left - they gave me hydroxyzine for the hives and itching. The PA also ordered meds for me to take at home.      - per patient report

I woke up in the middle of the night with a head ache and not feeling well. On the 24th I started sweating and dry heaving very bad and had no temp. I was in and out of the bathroom the entire shift.  The next day  (25th)I woke up and thought I had the flu, my lymph nodes in my throat had swollen and I just felt bad  the entire day.  The fatigue and exhaustion was un believable.  By the 28th I started to feel much better. Then everything returned back to normal.

My tongue was still numb but not getting any worse so i felt it was ok to leave. I decided to go home after those 2 hours and i took 10 min of zyrtec and about 5 hours later i still had a little numbness and tingling on the right side of the tongue but the rest of the tongue and lip had resolvedf. Had fatigue and myalgia for the rest of the day.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I went into a waiting room for the post-vaccine 15 minute observation. Approximately 2 minutes after sitting down I felt a sensation that can be described as a wave through my body. It only lasted for 10 seconds; however, it was immediately followed by a rapid heartbeat. It almost felt as though I might pass out (I have never passed out before). I alerted a nurse, and she monitored me for the 15 minute duration. After about 2 minutes, I felt &#39;normal&#39; again.

She has had extreme fatigue as well as body aches as well.

Red and itchy rash grew to size of softball next couple of days, armpit became more sore.  Rash and armpit soreness improved over next week, and now 95% better.

I sat with her and she had progressive tingling, worsening throat tightness and some facial swelling under her eye.  We then moved her to a room and laid her down.  I discussed the use of the Epipen and a dose was given at approximately 400PM.  We also called 911 at that time.  Vitals were taken and EMS arrived and by the time they were taking her away her symptoms were improving.

It then disappeared and then reappeared on day 7 post vaccine.  It was red, hot, raised, and extremely itchy.  It was larger in size slightly bigger than a half dollar. Today 2 weeks post vaccine it returned. Again itchy, red, warm to touch, raised and much larger in size. I put a call out to the CDC last week and have yet to hear back.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, January 4. I had a mildly sore arm for the first couple of days following the vaccine, but that was about it for side effects. I noticed my face was a little flushed when I was driving home afterward, but I chalked it up to being excited and nervous and wearing a face mask.  Seven days later, it started to feel itchy around my vaccination site (upper left arm). There has been some mild swelling around the site, in addition to being itchy. The area is also warmer than the rest of my arm or body. For one night, it was uncomfortable sleeping on my left side.  Starting on the 8th day after the vaccine, there is a small amount of redness just above the vaccine site, about an inch and a half wide, a little larger than a quarter.  Here are my doctor&#39;s notes, who I saw on January 12: Patient is a 40 y.o. female who presents for evaluation of rash/ possible injection reaction  involving the left upper arm. Rash started yesterday.. she noted slight swelling, warmth, and itching with pink erythema in a spot just above the area of her arm where she had her COVID injection 1 week ago. She received the Moderna vaccine.   Associated symptoms: no associated symptoms. Patient denies: fever, headache, arthralgia, abdominal pain, nausea, myalgia, decrease in energy level. She did not have significant pain at the time of the injection, and had a mild sore arm the following few days but no other symptoms after the shot. The warmth and swelling began just yesterday, almost a week later. She has reported this to the VARS website. She is employed by public health and is going to work at a covid vaccination site tonight, checking in people who are getting vaccines.  She has a h/o sensitive skin, but no h/o hives or urticaria, no previous injection reactions. She get racing heart from epinephrine but no other known allergies.  She denies dizziness, dyspnea, SOB, cough, or sensation of swelling in throat.  She has been using ibuprofen, cold compresses for sxs with some relief.  Assessment:  Probable injection site reaction, delayed reaction No strong evidence of cellulitis but we discussed signs and symptoms to be watchful for such as increased swelling and redness or tenderness of the overlying skin, fevers, chills, body aches.  Plan:  Medications: Benadryl 25 mg administered in clinic and discussed use of antihistamines to reduce injection site reaction. She can continue use of ibuprofen and cool compresses as well. Avoid over cooling of skin as this may also cause local reaction.  If pain, redness, or other sxs of concern progress she should follow up.  Verbal patient instruction given. Follow up: as needed.   If no further increase in sxs she should be able to receive her second vaccine but would premedicate with Benadryl to prevent local reaction again.

I have been very tired and had a headache since I got the vaccine. And over the last few days I have felt worse and my joints and muscle ache, I have been nauseas and mild chills with low grade fever.

                                                Racing heart, tingling sensation and ?heavy, full? feeling in the face; dizziness, confusion, difficulty concentrating and flushed face.  Racing heart began within the 15 min waiting period but I interpreted as anxiety.  Other symptoms began roughly 3 hrs post-vaccination.  Remedy was to leave work and go home, lay down in bed, and wait.  After a few hours symptoms mostly resolved, but face still feels strange (slight numbness and slight tingling).

                                                I had some initial sight swelling and redness that resolved after a few days. Then, on day 8 post vaccine, the swelling returned more intensely to the injection site, and started itching and a rash developed. It has grown slightly over the last 24 hours. I swam the morning that the swelling returned. Historically I do get swelling and redness from vaccines, but usually after it goes away it doesn&#39;t return.

                                                My shoulder was sore with a hard knot in the middle of a reddened area at the site of the injection. I was tired, had body aches and a severe headache for 3 days. This all subsided on the 4th day post injection. On the 6th day post injection my shoulder and neck began to hurt with swelling and a hard knot at my clavicle. It was tender to the touch and caused pain when moving my arm. I saw my doctor on the 7th day post injection with complaints and he said it is most likely a  viral infection and gave me meds to relieve pain. That night my shoulder started to throb and when I looked at it it is red, hot and swollen again. I still experience pain and discomfort to my shoulder and neck. The area where I received the vaccine itches as well.

                                                Update: Already made one report on January 13th describing how right hand and upper lip was numb. Right hand numbness lasted 4 hours then returned to normal. Upper lip numbness lasted 10&#43; hours and resolved sometime during that night when I was sleeping. On 14th when woke up (numbness gone) but had about an inch redness around injection site with a 7mm× 7mm lump under skin where injection given sore to touch.  On 15th site reaction still there and felt low on energy. Today 16th then redness seems to be a bit better and taking on more darkish hue (maybe turning into bruise?) And lump feels slightly smaller and not as sore. So site reaction might be on the way towards healing. However today I have been fatigued and drained feeling, low on energy. ( Dr notified of numbness post injection, and pic of arm via online portal. (No reply from Dr as of this date).  Seem to be on mend other than increasing fatigue, low on energy.

Roughly 3 hours later excessive fatigue started, along with increased lymph node swelling in the same area and now more painful. Tylenol 1000mg taken every 8  hours along with holding a warm compress to left side of the neck where swelling and pain occured with no relief achieved.  A headache also developed on this day and did not respond to tylenol.  Day 4 post vaccination: Continued lymph node swelling and pain on left side of neck along with new lymph nodal swelling noticed supraclavicular on the left side. Painful, red, and warm to touch.  Day 5: Excessive Fatigue, increasing neck pain on left side with noticeable swollen lymph nodes still present and noticeable without the need to palpate.  Day 6: Worsening fatigue, slept all day and some slight chills. Lymph nodes still enlarged but does not appear to be increasing in size any further on this day but has not decreased in size either.  Slight cough has developed this day.

She also developed a fever during the day.  She did not seek treatment until Sunday and went to Hospital ED.  She was treated and released same day.  She went back to hospital on Monday as she felt worse and she was admitted at that time and treated for a bloodstream infection and meningitis.  We are not sure it was caused by the vaccine.  She consulted her PCP and her PCP feels it may be more coincidental given her medical HX.

Her initial symptoms included hives which began 6 hours after receiving the vaccine. This eventually progressed to anaphylaxis and she went to the ED 2 days later.

                                                I was vaccinated on 12-30 after 4 pm.  By 3:30 on 12-31 my neck quickly swelled up, my throat becoming sore, glands swollen, headache, and fatigue were my first symptoms. An unusual symptom occurred from day 2-6. My facial skin did not hurt unless I applied pressure. When I applied pressure it felt bruised and highly sensitive but didn&#39;t hurt unless pressure was applied.  I also developed a small sore along my gum line on the bottom right front of my mouth.  Both of these symptoms disappeared after day 6. 7-8 days after receiving the vaccine my neck, jaw and shoulders became extremely stiff, including a runny nose. This symptom has persisted and is the worst of all symptoms (jaw and neck stiffness and sore throat). On day 12 in addition to the ongoing sore throat,  and stiffness in my neck and jaw I developed white spots on my right tonsil.  3 days after the white spots disappeared, but the red sore throat is current. On day 20, I developed 2 more sores on the right side of my mouth. One on the bottom gum line and one on the top right gum line (this feels like a canker sore). Today I have a slight earache in my right ear.   NOTE: I tested positive to COVID June 2020. I ended up taking 1 month off work due to persistent symptoms. I still cannot properly smell and taste, and I can smell water.  Occasionally, the brain fog from COVID comes up but that is more rare.

                                                Patient received her vaccine and was taken to the observation area to be observed for a 15-minute period. In the observation area, she immediately reported &#34;feeling funny&#34; and was noted to be &#34;sweaty&#34;. The advanced practice nurses and pharmacist were called for assistance immediately. She was placed on a stretcher, had her legs elevated, and was moved to a quieter area. She was responsive to commands and her vitals at this time were as follows: blood pressure 96/56 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 96%, and heart rate in mid 60s.  She did not require treatment and within several minutes of lying down on the stretcher felt better. She did not have any rashes or swelling, and she denied difficulty breathing. She was observed for about half an hour in this area and was also evaluated Emergency Medical Services who had been called. It was suggested that the patient should visit the Emergency Department for observation but she refused as she felt better and due to concerns of being exposed to Covid-19. We were able to walk with her escort her to the exit area at the end of the observation period.   We questioned her about potential allergies again and she denied a history of allergic reactions. The advanced practice nurse evaluating the patient suggested this episode was consistent with a vasovagal episode and that anxiety could have also played a role.

                                                8 days after injection, injection site got red, hot, inflamed. I wasn&#39;t sure what was going on so I went to Immediate Care on 01/12/21 where they put me on antibiotics and an antihistamine. I followed up with primary care on 01/15/21. By then my arm was almost back to normal. He told me to stop taking the antibiotics and antihistamines and report the reaction. I did as instructed and by 01/17/21 the redness, warmth and swelling had returned. I restarted the antihistamines and my arm has gone back down to normal.

The patient&#39;s medical history included a propensity for fainting and low blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient got dizzy, had nausea, a little vomit, and fainted to the floor. She reported feeling dizzy, hot and sweaty.  Patient did not take medication to treat her symptoms.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, fainted, dizziness, felt hot, nausea and vomiting, and sweaty were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 40-year-old female patient with medical history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the unlisted event of Syncope which was considered medically significant. Additionally, the patient experienced the non-serious listed events of Nausea and Vomiting, and the non-serious unlisted events of Feeling Hot, Dizziness and Hyperhidrosis. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. We would note that the patient&#39;s history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure could be also contributory.

Cried for my husband. Dripping sweat gave me a cold rag and foam large diarrhea began. Still 10/10 pain in abdomen. Felt like my lower abdomen was getting ripped out.  About 45 minutes or so later still 10/10 wanted to go to ER. I could not stand. If I stood my legs and body felt like I wanted to curl in a ball on the floor. He called an ambulance. I was pale as a ghost, no fever, normal vital signs. Went into full reynauds flare from body stress. Ambulance was unable to get oxygen sat and glucose at the time due to flare. Arrived at the ER labs drawn. WBC 10.9 and Glucose 194. I am not or never have been diabetic. Vaccine related. Like a lightswitch all symptoms stopped except sweating hot and cold spells, sore arm and drowsiness. Discharged at 6am

Monday (9 days after vaccine)  it had grown to approximately  4 inch rash on left arm. It continued to grow the next few days  and seemed to slip (move) down my arm the next few days. My doctor had prescribed antibiotics and on day 12 the rash seems to be going away.

I was given 25mgs Benadryl by mouth and taken directly to ER.  In the ER I was given another 25mg Benadryl by mouth, hooked up to BP monitor, heart monitor and pulse ox.  After seeing the doctor on duty I was given an injection of a steroid and Vistaril and 2 Pepcid by mouth.  The symptoms began to subside and I was released approximately 2hrs later with prescriptions for Prednisone, Pepcid, Epi-pen and told to take 50mg Benadryl every 6 hrs for 3 days.  I was to return immediately if symptoms reoccurred.

                                                One hour after vaccine, arm began to hurt then progressed to hurting so much I could not lift it for two days without significant pain. By 7 hours after vaccine, chills and fatigue started and I could not get warm. That same night upset stomach and migraine as well as hot sweats between the chills. No fevers noted. These symptoms worsened on the next day. Very fatigued all day and little to no appetite. Sunday started improving but easily fatigued with walking more than 100 feet. Still little appetite. Able to eat half usual amount at dinner that night. No chills anymore. Still sweats. Monday still easily fatigued but not as bad as sunday. Appetite improving. Still sweats with minimal exertion.

These were mild/moderate symptoms and came and went for about 1 hour,  decreasing in severity from the time of injection.  They were the worst within the first 20 minutes post injection.    I consulted with Dr. prior to my vaccination due to my mast cell disorder; he said to take 2 Zyrtec  an hour prior to injection - which i did.  I still had the above reaction.  Also had pain at injection site for approx 48 hours

                                                On Wednesday, Feb 17, I experienced an earache in my left ear and an eye twitch in the left eye, which continued to Thursday , Feb 18.  On Feb 18,  also experienced extreme fatigue and a jabbing, throbbing pain behind my left ear that came and went all day.  I also noticed when I brushed my teeth that I had a hard time swishing water in my mouth, especially on the left side.  On Friday morning, I woke up and noticed my left eyelid was drooping and my smile was lopsided.  As I have a history of hemiplegic migraine, I assumed I was experiencing a migraine, although this was not the usual course of these migraines, and I had not had one of these types of migraines in many years.  The left side of my head, behind my ear, and wrapping from my neck to my temple continued to hurt (but not as painful as a normal migraine).  Thinking I was in a chronic migraine state, I took 40 mg of Prednisone, as I have done before to &#39;cut through&#39; the migraine.  When the facial weakness did not resolve by the next day, I suspected this was not migraine and instead suspected Bell&#39;s Palsy and consulted my physician.  Looking back in time, I also realized that I had experienced some adverse tingling/taste sensations on part of my tongue as far back as February 8, that felt similar to burning your tongue from drinking too hot liquids that I realized later could have also been part of the Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

                                                Woke up with extreme leg aches and low grade fever, also noticed that my arm was really sore, swollen, red and hot to the touch. Took Tylenol and Benadryl.  This continued from Wednesday-Saturday.  On Sunday, I began feeling normal again, except that my arm is still sore, red, swollen, bruised, and hot to the touch.

                                                12/31/20 10:30a Vaccine given 10:48a Left the vaccine observation room 11:30a Started feeling warm like maybe my temp was increasing, face was red 12:00p had what felt like an adrenaline spike through my body became hot and jittery feeling. 12:30p The spikes started coming in waves, like a full body hot flash. Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) &amp; 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), &amp; 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable. Injection arm a little sore, no redness or swelling at site of injection. Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl. Did not have complete resolution of swelling but did improve. Mild hives, swelling of hands and feet. 1/2/21 All joint pain is gone, and injection site pain is only noticeable if someone bumps into my arm. 6a 25mg Benadryl &amp; Pepcid 10a 25mg Benadryl 2p 25mg of Benadryl 3:30pm felt fine all day with only mild swelling and redness to hands, ate chicken nachos. Face became very hot (like my face was too close to the oven when I open it), redness from eyes down, lips swollen, mild itchiness too the tongue but nothing too concerning. 4p 25mg Benadryl I strongly believe the exacerbating factor is eating as all times the symptoms increased in intensity I had just eaten. After discussion with Dr. will be cutting out chicken (chicken was eaten before all 3 instances) and all other meats until complete resolution of symptoms and will avoid any inflammatory foods such as nuts, berries and shellfish. 7p 25mg Benadryl &amp; Claritin taken 7:30p ate a banana, no reaction 8p Singular taken 9:30p put Vaseline on my lips, face &amp; ears flamed hot and swelling and redness followed. 9:45p took 25mg Benadryl 10:25p tongue thick feeling 11p took 25mg Benadryl tongue still feels thick 1/3/21 Fevers 101.6 and chills started in the night Face and lips are permanently swollen and red despite all the meds I?m taking.Lymph nodes are all swollen. I?m too afraid to eat for fear of more swelling while my face is already so swollen.

                                                41 y.o. female presents to the ED with concern for possible allergic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine that she had received approximately an hour prior to arrival.  Patient reports that shortly after receiving her vaccine in her left arm she developed the sensation of her throat closing and a &#34;film &#34;in the back of her throat.  Patient has also reported feeling nauseated and having a throat clearing cough.  No chest pain, headache, abdominal pain or development of a rash.  Injection site appears to be unremarkable. Patient is given some antihistamine medications as well as steroids and observed here in the ED.  The patient has improvement in her sensation of her throat closing and is able to be discharged.  I discussed with the patient the usefulness of continued antihistamines over the course of the next few days and would likely advise on not receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine based on her reaction to the first.  Discussed with the patient the use of epinephrine and EpiPen as needed.  See discharge instructions.  Patient is discharged home with her sister in improved condition.

I felt mild pain in my arm in the evening of the 31st and then the pain started from my elbow to my neck on my right side. I went to sleep and woke up with general malaise, chills, body ache, sore throat, headache. the same feeling I had when I had covid, a heaviness in my chest, almost like a shortness of breathe. I was flushed and felt feverish although I never had a fever. The symptoms lasted all day.  On the first also my arm pain was severe, I could not even lift it the whole day. I went to sleep on 01/01 and when I woke up on 01/02 the symptoms were all gone. I took Tylenol 3 times to help me with the symptoms. 3 grams total in 24 hrs.

                                                Patient had history of feeling dizzy/faint from needle pokes. She thought she&#39;d be alright- but 5 minutes after the vaccine, she got very pale and lightheaded. Staff eased her onto the floor (she did not faint or lose consciousness) and staff raised her feet up on a chair. Then after about 5 minutes on the floor, we had her sit up and helped her to a cot- continued to lay down another 15 minutes. She also had not eaten or had anything to drink yet that day (she was vaccinated at 11:15am). Given apple juice, which also helped her body recover. No injury was sustained.

Had a telehealth visit with my PA due to never having a reaction to a vaccine before other than a sore arm at site.   He prescribed Benadryl.  The rash started within a few hours after being vaccinated.   Rash lasted 4-5 hours.  The time frame is estimated for both onset and duration as I was working and not near a mirror.

The circle was not in the same place as the injection site.   By 1/4/21 the circle was fine and gone.  The circle appeared again 1/6/21, and was more itchy and deeper in color.  When I awoke the morning of 1/7/21 the circle had gotten larger in size and also other small circles appeared further up my arm.  I took a antihistamine medication, Benadryl medication and have iced my arm today, but the circle and bumps are spreading further.  My arm is very warm, itchy and tingly.  I contacted my clinic and they suggested I report the adverse event via the VAERS.

                                                On 12/25, I woke up feeling fatigued with slight body aches. I had significant soreness in my left arm where I received the vaccine, radiating down to my forearm. At approximately 7-8pm, I felt extremely cold.  I then noticed I had a flat, red rash on my face, chest, upper back, and shoulders.  There was no difficulty breathing, swallowing, or associated itching. My temperature was 99.0.  I went to bed at approximately 10pm, with no change in the rash.  I woke up the next morning at about 6am.  The rash was gone, and I felt well.  On 12/31, I developed moderate itching in the area of my left upper arm.  I noticed swelling, redness, and warmth in what felt like the exact area where I received my injection.  This continued into 1/1 except the itching had resolved, and I felt point tenderness as well as a cool, tingling sensation in my left upper arm. On 1/2 there was a shadow of redness in the area of my left upper arm, but the warmth, swelling, and tingling sensation had resolved.

Did fine with injection, sat down for observation, 8-10 minutes later started feeling sweaty, then passed out. Woke up on the floor with nurses around me feeling tightness in chest, numbness in fingers, body shaking off and on, started to feel like tongue was swelling. Nurses gave IV fluids,  oxygen and 2 Epi-Pens. Transported by ambulance to Buffalo General Hospital. Symptoms resolved not long after arrival at hospital. Remained in EMT bay hallway for observation., seen there by ER doctor. Another EGK done, additional half bag of IV fluids, released after 4 hours observation.

I felt heat rush into the left side of my head, I was extremely light headed and couldn?t catch my breath. I asked if there was a nurse that could help me. There was 1 paramedic watching everyone. I stepped outside, took my mask off to catch my breath. One staff member accompanied me and sat next to me. I began to shake in my legs and arms involuntarily, my heart kept beating and I just tried to do deep breathing techniques to catch my breath.  The paramedic came outside and asked if I wanted help. I declined his help and I called my husband who was sitting in the car to help me walk to our car. At 1:15, my heart was beating less rapid, I walked back to the car and as my husband was driving us home, my heart began to beat rapidly again, I felt burning and heat in my head and I began to shake in my arms and legs. It lasted about 10-15 minutes. We got home and I could barely walk into the house because I was so weak in my legs. I went to bed where my heart began beating back to normal after 1 hour or so.

                                                I had my first COVID 19 Moderna vaccine Lot: 025J20-2A at hospital. Within about 60 seconds of receiving it, my heart started pounding hard and rapidly and I let a nurse know. She took my vitals and my heart rate was very high, as was my blood pressure. My O2 was fine. I had some tightness and heaviness I my chest. I felt flush in my cheeks, but did not have hives. The nurse said my color was very pale. I was warm, given an ice pack, and then a bit later cold. At one point they wanted me to go to the Emergency Department, which I refused (perhaps stupidly). I&#39;m not sure I was thinking clearly. I was trying very hard to stay calm and relaxed. My blood pressure was very elevated for about an hour and a half. They finally let me go home when I was 140/95 (my usual is 110 over 70 ish). I had some tongue tingling at home, very briefly.

Been this way since the 6th of January and I thought it was sore due to the shot and the other small issues I had( headache, low grade fever) The pain was not going away after all the other issues did.

                                                I already reported one rash or reaction on the last VAERS report I made 1/7/2021.  After going to an urgent care facility on 1/8/2021 and given a steriod shot, steriod medication and antibiotics, the rash disappeared by the end of the day on 1/8/2021.  The rash appeared again on 1/11/2021 but in the form of small bumps on the same right arm.  The bumps and rash are spreading again on my right arm.  I will be going to see a dermatologist on 1/13/2021 because the rash is not going away or slowing down.  The bumps are raised, bright red and spreading on my arm.

                                                A day after the shot I was in the shower and started experiencing exhaustion and shortness of breath. I also had tachycardia. I proceeded not to feel well they?re very next day. Then on Friday I was dizzy and a coworker said that I was flushed and I wasn?t feeling well. I proceeded to go see patients and while examining a patient I became very dizzy and lightheaded while bent over and almost passed out when I came up.. at that time I decided to leave work and go to my PCP. Orthostatic?s were positive and EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and an echo is ordered. Echo was normal. Throughout the week I continued to have tachycardia and shortness of breath with any type of exertion. I left work this morning and was tested for Covid because of my symptoms.

                                                On Wed, Jan13, 2021 I noticed pain in my right arm pit when using deodorant.  I got progressively more uncomfortable and swelling throughout the day.  On Thursday, Jan 14, 2021, I woke up to itchy, burning sensation in my right arm.  It got hot, hard and very itchy as the morning went on.  Sharp burning pain started in my right arm muscles.  I saw PA at my PCP&#39;s office.  She also had a doctor take a look as well.  I was prescribed prednisone taper for 12 days, and I was recommended to take OTC benedryl.   Today, Saturday, January 16, 2021 it is still continuing to get larger, covering most of my upper right arm.  Benedryl has been helping with the itchiness.  It is not as hot and hard, yet continues to spread.  The burning sensation has dulled but still uncomfortable.

                                                After over a week post vaccination I have noticed redness under the vaccination site that was warm to touch. Also noted significant discomfort and soreness in the armpit are and around the shoulder of the vaccinated arm. After palpating, I could locate several enlarged lymph nodes that were tender. The arm still has swelling and redness, however, lymph nodes are less tender although still sore.

I stayed home from work and reported it and was told I could return to work on 1/11 (my next scheduled day) by workplace health. I felt fatigue and eye pressure headaches on and off since. I also felt like I was having vision changes. On 1/14/21 I noticed a small, raised, red area at the injection site. Over the weekend it continued to spread over my arm. It is warm and very mild tenderness to palpation but does not itch. I am also feeling tight muscle pain in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.

                                                Approximately 36 hours of fever of 101, chills, shivering, sweats, aches and pain in every joint in my body, back pain, headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, nausea, difficulty completing my daily work duties and household activities due to pain and not feeling well. This was not much helped by Alleve, therefore I took Tylenol which was mildly helpful. After the first 36 hours, the symptoms lessened in severity and lasted for about another 12 hours. After that, I felt well for several days in a row, then about 1 week later I felt sore, weak, tired and nauseous. This resolved in its own in about 2 hours. I have felt well since then. I am choosing to receive my second dose of moderna vaccine tomorrow, because I would rather experience these side effects then catch COVID ever again. I caught COVID19 in March 2020. With my COVID infection, I was sick for about 21 days with fever of 101 and more, bone pain, body aches, chest pain, back pain, headaches, nausea, shaking chills, sweats, trouble breathing, dyspnea, cough, runny nose, sore throat, pink eye, dizziness, tiredness, ?brain fog? and fatigue. I was not hospitalized. After about 21 days I began to recover, but the first week after my recovery began I was very weak and tired, and spent most of my time sleeping. I was 41 years old at the time, with health problems including well controlled asthma and being overweight. I never wish to experience this again and I am grateful that I am receiving the Modena vaccine. Thank you so much for logging my side effects.

Have iced the area and I have taken extra Tylenol and Benadryl to help with the reaction. To note: I do have a large tattoo on my arm that is several years old. Just a note in case that is important.

This is typical for me when I am starting to fight something off.  I was managing okay until around 1pm when I started to low grade fever at 99.8.  By around 4pm, my body was really starting to ache and I was getting chills.  After the training, I took some Thera Flu, but I couldn?t really move from the couch to the bed because my body was so sore.  My fever fluctuated between high 99?s to low 100?s.  I felt like I got hit by a truck.  I managed to fall asleep around 8:00pm and was able to sleep until 1:00am.  I took more Thera Flu, water, and was able to fall back to sleep at 3:00ish am. 1/23/21:  I woke again at 11:00am and my aching was still there but not nearly as bad as the previous day but now I felt heavy congestion in my head and chest.  I also had sneezing, and a stuffy then runny nose off and on throughout the day.  I was also very, very tired and had no energy to do anything but lay there.  Today is when the diarrhea started 1/24/21:  Body aches at this point are still tolerable but I?m sore.  My arm injection site is bruising and starting to itch and still slightly warm to the touch.  I have sneezing, a dry cough, and an off and on runny nose and diarrhea  1/25/21:  Body aches are mild today, dry cough is here, post nasal drip mucus I am assuming as well.  All I want to do is sleep.  I?m so tired.  No diarrhea today so far but I haven?t had anything to eat yet.

                                                Day after initial shot my arm became sore, red, hot, swollen and hard.  This was in addition to other side effects.  This subsided after 4-5 days. On day 9 after injection my arm became red, and hot again at the injection site.  It was not as inflamed as the initial injection reaction, however very noticeable.  On day 10 I woke at night with vertigo as well.  I was able to fall back asleep after about an hour, and when I woke the next morning the vertigo has subsided. My arm had redness on and off for about 5 more days, seeming to get worse after my shower.  The redness has now subsided completely, however it looks as though I have a minor &#34;bruise&#34; under my skin at the injection site.

                                                warm, mildly itchy rash first noticed this morning upon waking. Currently measures approximately 1.5&#34; x 2.5&#34;. It is 11 days since I received the vaccine so it seems unusual for a reaction to be so delayed, but since the vaccine is new I&#39;d rather report it as possibly associated than ignore it. Will do my best to photo-document in case that&#39;s helpful to anyone in the future; I don&#39;t foresee needing medical treatment for this.

                                                41 yo healthy woman with history seafood allergy, developed sensation of throat tightness/closing 7 minutes after vaccination. She stated this was similar to sensation she has after exposure to seafood and that these respond to diphenhydramine.  She looked well and had stable vitals. She was observed for10 minutes and did not have worsening symptoms. She was given diphenhydramine 50mg orally and monitored for an additional 60 minutes. She was breathing comfortably, had no dyspnea or wheezing, or swelling of lips, gum, or oropharynx. She reported improved symptoms and was allowed to return to her home. On follow up telephone call 3 hours later, she reported complete resolution of the symptom.

It was a delayed reaction. One day later, the swelling went down but the redness spread. Five days after my symptoms appeared, I am doing much better but my arm is still a little itchy. I am reporting it per my doctor?s advice because it was strange and how it was a week delayed. I did have injection site pain the day following but no swelling or redness like what happened a week later. Is it safe for me to get the second shot?

My first vaccine was on 12/23/20. Several days after a small area around the injection site became swollen and itchy.  I also had a small palpable lump under my skin at the injection and my skin had a small area of hyper pigmentation for ~2 weeks. Again the area was much smaller and I did not think it would be considered an &#34;Adverse&#34; effect. I was also unaware that I was several weeks pregnant at the time of my first vaccine. when I went to the doctors office on 1/23/21 I was told I was 7.5 weeks pregnant, there was no heartbeat and I had miscarried.

                                                I took my first dose of the Covid vaccine on Thursday, 01/28/2021 a 6:05 pm. Then on Friday afternoon, my temperature was around 100. I had chills, a sore arm, and weakness. It continued on Saturday as well. On Sunday morning, I woke up with chills on my chest, shoulders, and back. The rash was pink colored and it was itchy.  Around Sunday afternoon, the color turned to bright red and spread to my belly and arms. Then I took a shower and Benadryl. Monday morning, it is still itchy and fades away. I contacted my primary physician. They told me to take another Benadryl.

                                                Chills began within 2 hours of injection.  Fever rose to 101 within 6 hours and lasted for approximately 48 hours.  Chills lasted the entire time the fever lasted.  After the fever came down to below 100, bodyache became more recognizable.  Most unusual pain, which began while the temperature was above 100, was in the muscles connecting my neck to the shoulders, more severely on the left-side where the injection was administered.  The pain was so severe that it felt the muscle was tense, numb and itchy at the same time. The severity of the pain made it feel like the throat was closing up even though I knew it was not true because I did not have trouble breathing.  This pain lasted (in similar intensity) approximately about 36 hours. After this, on the third day, most of the pain was gone but I experienced dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea.  I had a loss of appetite the whole time (over 72 hours) I was experiencing these side effect symptoms.

                                                Received the vaccine Friday around 11:40 am. Arm was sore and had joint/body aches that evening.  Saturday 2/20, 24 hours after getting the vaccine my tongue started to swell up/ was splotchy/ had bumps allong the side and my throat was scratchy. My breathing/asthma was also triggered and I increased use of my albuterol.  I took benadryl with minimum results, but symptoms did not get severe enough to go to the ER.   The next day, Sunday 2/21 my tongue was still swollen and my jaw/ face were also sore and had inflammation. This was in addition to the sore arm/joints.

                                                I?ve experienced severe allergic reactions to many things. I?m now allergic to soy, yeast, wheat, coffee, casein (dairy) peanuts, green beans/ legumes, eggs, onion and celery. I?ve had a huge rash that broke out on my left arm that started at the spot where I received the injection.  Now I?ve been experiencing my mouth and tongue swelling to the point that my throat has closed up. I?ve been hospitalized as air wasn?t going through my body. I had to inject an Epi-pen in my leg, and be taken to the hospital. I?m currently on high dosage prednisone, Benadryl and several other meds to address the swelling in my tongue that happens daily. I am desperate to find out if there is anyway to stabilize anything that vaccine had in it to see if this condition will get better.

                                                Onset of leg weakness and instability that has progressively worsened. Constant imbalance noted more in standing and with walking resulting in feeling like I am &#34;rocking on a boat&#34; constantly. Increased sway in static standing that is more pronounced with rotational movements, eyes closed, and decreased base of support. Ataxic movements and lateral veering with walking at times. Episodes of low blood pressure/significant decrease in blood pressure from sitting to standing, tachycardia, and resting tremors in the hands that are intermittent in nature. Feeling of head being &#34;in the clouds&#34; constantly where something is not right.

Woke up March 7th with swollen lips/throat/tongue. went to urgent care and received an EpiPen and steroid. Monitored for a couple of hrs and went home for a nap. (refused the ER at this time as I felt better). Woke up around 2:30 and my symptoms worsened . We to ER and received another Epipen for anaphylactic shock. Remained at the hospital for 5 days. Had 5 episodes while there. Also, had tightening in chest and what felt like a heart attack. Been resting, still very tired and swollen nodes in my neck and sore throat as well as aches. Also, might be developing thrush. Didn&#39;t run a fever and Ive never had an allergic reaction  before this.

                                                I had the normal shoulder pain for a couple days. Then day 6 developed extreme malaise with nausea.  I kept saying it felt like my whole body was floppy and melting into the couch, and I couldn?t motivate to stand or do anything for 24 hours.  Then myalgias and nausea continued for 2 days.  Around the same time as the malaise, I developed a palpable indurated area under the vaccine site.  Then day 8 my entire shoulder swelled up with overlying red leathery skin and axillary pain but no adenopathy.  Day 10, back to normal except for some residual red pruritic skin extending down my arm.

Once I looked at my arm in a mirror I saw that it was swollen, red &amp; itchy. At the time the redness was about the side of a 1/2 dollar. The last few days I have noticed that my arm is itchy, red, swollen &amp; now feels like a rash in the same location but the redness is about the size of a baseball.

                                                A little over 24 hours post vaccination (09JAN2021), I started to experience some tongue numbness/tingling along the lateral edges and the tip of my tongue.  This is ongoing as of time of this report.  This is not interfering with function, but it is a new symptom that I did not have prior to receiving my vaccination.  As additional medical history in the last 30 days, I had dental work done for a broken filling on 21DEC2020 (multiple numbing injections during this visit - two molars grounded down to prepare for placement of two crowns of left lower molars).   2 crowns placed on 06JAN2021 (1 numbing injection at this visit). Additionally, I also started with symptoms of inner ear infection on 03JAN2021, was evaluated by medical provider on 05JAN2021 and diagnosed with suspected inner ear infection, for which I am currently taking doxycycline and sudafed for.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

I began taking Benedryl and continued to take Benedryl every 4-6 hours over approximately the next 48 hours. Also, I originally had no injection site reaction, however, on Jan 9th, my right arm began to itch. Upon assessment, I noted a 1.5&#34; diameter red, warm area where the vaccine had been administered. This lasted for three days, and now, January 12th it no longer itches, and looks more like a bullseye that is approximately 2.5&#34; in diameter around where the redness was. I have also noticed that since the vaccine I feel cloudy or like I have a constant mild headache.

By that evening my headache was still there and I had the chills and felt exhausted. For next three days after I had a normal headache on and off accompanied by nausea. Tylenol slightly relieved the headache. The last few days I have been feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; but the headache is gone. I noticed my lymph nodes were a little swollen which I am thinking is what caused the headaches.

Sunday night switched to Benadryl. Itchy throughout entire body- tingly lips and nose, but no swelling to tongue.

This happened 6 days after injection. I?m assuming this must be related to injection but have not seemed medical attention for professional opinion yet.

                                                About 8 minutes into my 15 minute observation time after receiving my first COVID vaccine, my tongue started tingling.  The observation nurse gave be a Benadryl and water.  within the next minutes my whole body started tingling, I felt nauseas, and felt like I was going to pass out. The nurse laid me on the ground.  I asked her to take my BP and pulse.  For me it was high 145/98.  My pulse was also reported t be high.  I was able to swallow and breath.  I continued to have waves up and down my whole body of tingling, nasusea and cold sweats.  The nurse called my husband to come.  I was able to sit up after about 20 minutes.  The waves of feeling sick continued for about an hour.  After having some food and drink about 2 hours later I was able to drive home.  I was exhausted, nauseous, and had a headache the next 2 days.  I am concerned to get my second vaccine.

I got blood work today with  it showed my WBC was down to 4 and my normal WBC is usually at 6 and I am frequently checked and always normal. because of kidney stones I get checked regularly. I was told to get a covid test and will have the blood test run again on Monday to see if its back to normal. I wonder if this has anything to do with my auto immune disease as well. also back and neck aches and pains.

                                                Around 730-8 I got a really bad headache. Throughout the night my back tightened up and my hips. I got up tp get ready to go to work, I felt really  light headed while I was brushing my teeth but went in to work. I started felling shortened of breathe and achy. I started feeling  bad and told my Head Nurse and he took my BP and I have a fever. My heart beat was rapid. I went home, slept and had no appetite . The I ended up going to the Hospital  my chest was hurting bad in my lung area, everything about me just hurt I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

                                                I received my second dose of the moderna vaccine on a Sunday at 10:30 am in my left deltoid.   Symptoms started with chills and swollen supraclavicular lymph nodes around 10:30 that night, and progressed to body aches,  joint pain, muscle pain,  and a low grade fever.   I was unable to sleep due to chills and pain.   The muscle pain would radiate down my arms and legs, and I would sometimes have a pinpoint sharp pain in the bottom of my left foot.  Symptoms persisted the next day, and also included extreme fatigue, nausea, and enlarged and painful axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  The  supraclavicular lymph nodes were large enough to visibly see.   A round rash/redness started around the injection site started on Monday as well.   This also occurred with the first vaccine, but is much larger this time.   Most symptoms had resolved as of Tuesday, except for fatigue and the rash which are still on going.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0830. My arm felt sore during the day. In the evening (around 1700), I began to feel muscle aches and pain in my joints (wrists, knees, ankles). I also felt fatigue and brain fog. My injection site (L upper arm) was sore, felt hot to touch and was about 5/10 pain-wise.  I took Tylenol 1,000mg PO and rested for the next 24 hours. The muscle aches and joint pain resolved after 24 hours. However, up to 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt extreme fatigue and could not resume my regular level of activity. After 48 hours, I returned to regular activities.

                                                Soreness in my arm the day and night of the vaccine that continued for a couple of days.  Then, a week and a day after I received the vaccine, I developed &#34;Covid Arm&#34; with the red itchy rash, hot to the touch on the arm where I received the injection.  The Covid Arm has faded tremendously but is still itchy and lasted at least 9 days.

It became red, swollen, hot to touch, itchy, and sore.  I marked the area.  I called my PCP on 1/1/21,  She recommended I keep an eye on it, as I have no fevers nor do I feel sick, that it is likely a delayed immune response.  1/2/21- the redness has spread beyond markings but is less swollen and sore. Seems to be improving.

                                                Patient felt tingling and vibrating in all extremities right after the vaccine.  She was hyperventilating.  Had o2 sats between 98-100. HR ranged from 100-117.  She was clammy with no chills.  Rapid COVID test performed and it was negative.  Because the patient complained of trouble breathing and was about  to use her AuviQ, paramedics were called. The patient did go with the paramedics.

By the time I arrived home around 3 pm I had chills, achiness but never ran a fever. This went on throughout that evening. When I woke up the next day I felt great until approximately 1000 am and then began having diarrhea. That lasted for about 5 hours. I had some soreness in my L arm where the shot was given however the following  Monday (1-4-21) I had a hard lump where the shot was given and a red rash that appeared. The rash has improved today but is not completely gone.&#34;

                                                about 2 minutes after receiving the shot I felt like I was having an allergic reaction in my chest area. My lower esophagus got extremely tight and then it worked its way up to the back of my throat. It felt like there was a lump in the back of my throat, along with burning in my throat. This same reaction also occurs when I eat certain foods I&#39;m intolerant to. I felt very dizzy right after as well. After exactly one hour my throat symptoms went away but suffered from residual effects for the next few days.  The next day I couldn&#39;t lift my left arm(which went away 2 days later), I was out of breath with everything I did, dizzy, muscle cramps, chills, body aches(as though I had the flu) and had extreme fatigue. All of theses symptoms lasted for the next week almost two.

                                                I received Moderna dose 1 on December 29th, 2020 around 10:30 a.m.  I did experience chills, body aches, extreme fatigue, pain and swelling at injection site for about 36 hours.  However, symptoms seems to resolve after a couple of days.  On Tuesday, January 5th around 5 p.m. at the injection site in my right arm it began to itch.  By 9 p.m. I had a huge red circle around 3 inches in diameter around the injection site, it was sore, swollen, warm to the touch. itchy and lymph nodes under right axilla were swollen.  I contacted my Dr. immediately the morning of Wednesday, January 6th and after assessing me she felt it was a skin infection. She prescribed Doxycycline antibiotic and Zyrtec by day, Benadryl by night.  I began the antibiotic treatment with first dose on 1/6/21 at 1:30 p.m., dose 2 9:00 p.m. and dose 3 on Thursday, January 7th 2020 around 8:00 a.m.  I have responded well to the treatment and already my arm is much improved.  My Dr. felt it could have been the technique of the administration of the vaccine that caused infection.  However, I wanted to report in case anyone else with this batch also experienced similar response.

The injection site was also very red, raised, itchy, and hot to the touch.  By Monday morning 1/4/21, nothing had changed taking ibuprofen and I consulted with a female GI doctor I work for.  She recommended that I see me PCP.  I was able to get in that same morning to the PA, and she called the Dr for further consultation after examining me.  He advised not getting the second dose of the vaccine and prescribed mthyprednisolone (medrol) 6 day pack.

                                                I saw patient on 1/6/2021 for a possible vaccine reaction. She had her vaccine on Dec 31 and had arm soreness. On the evening of 1/5/2021 she had headache, chills, and during the night sweating. She woke on 1/6/2021 with itching on wrists with a red raised rash and then noted it was also on her hips when she took a shower. In office on 1/6/2021 she had erythema on wrists (she had applied Kenalog cream and states that it was no longer raised after application of the cream) and she had small dime to quarter sized hives on bilateral hips. My colleagues and I researched and found that people can get a serum illness with any vaccine so we checked labs and a UA ? it was all normal but a little protein in her UA. I spoke with patient on 1/7/2021 and she stated that her hives had spread over her buttocks the evening of 1/6/2021 but had resolved by the time she woke on 1/7/2021 and she was not having any current symptoms yesterday late afternoon when I spoke with her. She feels sluggish on 1/8/2021 but overall feels okay. No more rash. We discussed that she can return to her next shift on Monday 1/11/2021 unless she notes any other symptoms / return of symptoms she will let us know.

The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

She presented to ED 12/28 noted to have hypokalemia and  head CT showed mild occipital encephalitis, admitted overnight for obs subsequent brain MRI was normal.  She was seen in my clinic 2 days later (1/4/21) and was started on 3 day course of Decadron, topical acyclovir for herpetic lesion.  As she is a nurse, I kept her off work until resolution of symptoms. Seen again on 1/8/21, headache resolved.  She did discuss CT and MRI results with neurologist. He was not convinced this was vaccine related.  She is having 2nd dose of vaccine on 1/11/21.

                                                Eight days after the injection (1/7/21), I developed an inflamed rash on my left arm. It was hot to the touch and itched .  It was round and approximately 2 inches in diameter.  I called my doctor on 1/8/21, and she had me come in and be seen. She diagnosed as cellulitis from a secondary infection at the injection site and prescribed sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim 800/160mg every 13 hours for 7 days. The rash started to go away, but on 1/10/21, it began to itch again and became inflamed. On the morning of 1/11/21, it had grown and changed shape. It is now oval and over 3 inches in diameter. It also has a pronounced border. On, that day, I also found out that 2 co-workers had a similar reaction. I spoke with my doctor, who told me to report it to the CDC.

Pain and swelling moved down into armpit and below followed by extreme itching.  Swelling and pain then moved down to left elbow. Then I developed throat itching, difficulty swallowing and wheezing. I also developed joint pain in opposite shoulder. I  immediately took 600 mg Ibuprofen and 50 mg Benadryl .  Itching, redness, and wheezing, and difficulty swallowing resolved about 30 minutes after taking the medication.  Next morning (today) I still have pain and swelling around injection site. Pain in left elbow and right shoulder joints. I still have moderate pain and edema below left armpit.

                                                Felt a burning sensation in my hands right after getting the shot.  Went home,  took 2  Aleve and iced my arm for 5 minutes at a time on and off about 4 times.  Hours later,  about 8 pm I was laying down on the couch on my left side for at least 20 minutes.  When I was getting up my upper left arm was very numb and I had a strange sensation on my left side like my blood had pooled over there but it was very numb in the area.  I never have felt anything like that.  The sensation did go away over the course of a few minutes.  Soon after I was having shooting pain in my hands.  It felt like arthritis pain.  This did not last too long but came back here and there.  My lower back started hurting a little bit out of nowhere.  And then when I went to bed I started having random body aches all over.  Like brief shooting pain in different parts of my body.  I did have some dryness, weird sensation in my throat at times. The body aches kept me up until 2 or 3 am.  It was resolved by the time I woke.  I never felt that I had a temperature.  And I was not sick prior so I felt it was a cause and effect from the vaccine.  I took 2 Aleve and I went to work.  Temperature checked at work and I was 97.1,  normal.  Wore a mask all day,  social distanced at work and I had mentioned to my manager upon arrival that I had symptoms/reaction? after my shot.  I did still have some residual,  arthritis type pain in my hands during the day and more so when I got home.  I also felt fatigued when I got home from work but I was half awake most of the night before due to the body aches.  Felt pretty good,  normal on the second day after the vaccine.

                                                I was fine the day of the vaccination.  I started feeling bad overnight - got a headache and arm got sore.  When I woke up in the morning to get ready for work I felt very weak.  I walked into my bathroom and lost conciousness.  I woke up on the floor and had hit my forehead on the tile floor.  I was confused when I got up, and proceeded to get into the shower.  I then passed out again in the shower and hit the back of my head against the shower wall.  My husband found me as I woke up on the shower floor.  He called my doctor and took me to the emergency department on doctors advice.

                                                On 1/15/20 at 10am, i noticed my L arm at the vaccine injection site was itchy and felt like it had a couple of raised bumps.  I was at work so i didn?t look at it until i got home after 5pm, when i discovered a blotchy rash around the injection site,  around 2 inches long by an inch wide.  It was itchy.  As the night went on, it grew larger, became more raised like a welt, and became painful/tender.  It was also still itching and burning, and hot to the touch.  I didn?t take my temperature but i was very cold and have felt fatigued for two days.   I applied ice, which seemed to help some, and took Benadryl.   It has grown a bit larger overnight.

My hand and wrist does have pain in them at times and does make this bothersome and at times difficult to use at my line of work for the developmentally disabled.  This is the arm that I was given the vaccination in.

                                                8 mins after receiving first dose, I became very dizzy, my heart rate increased and I started sweating.  I never passed out and remained sitting.  The episode lasted 1-2 minutes.  I did not need assistance.    Then 2 -3 hours later I had the exact same episode and reported it to the downtown clinic and they only urged me to self monitor or report to ER if needed.  Those were the only 2 episodes.    My blood pressure was elevated that afternoon but was very low for 3 days and I did not take my atenolol for those days.

It later became itchy and over the next few days started to spread all over my upper arm. No pain and the hardness went away after a couple of days. But redness, swelling, and it itchiness remains at day 12 post vaccine.

I took acyclovir and it subsided. Two days later I got another cold sore in the same location. That was very different. Usually when I take acyclovir it clears up very well. I took acyclovir again.  Then today (1/24) I have another cold sore, this time in a different location.  I have not had excessive stress or bad sleep which can sometimes trigger cold sores for me.  I have never had multiple in a week. I will get one cold sore every 6 months or so on average. I wondered if it is due to an immune response from the vaccine.  Also, I have some large cancer sores inside my mouth.   (I had arm pain for three days after the vaccine  and some fatigue the day after)

                                                She received her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 7:30 AM on 1-22-21. At 9:15 AM, she felt lightheaded, her heart was racing, and vertigo.  She had a nurse check her blood pressure and it was 101/65 and her heart rate was 138 bpm.  She felt presyncopal so she went to the ED for evaluation.  By the time she got to the ED, she felt her throat was scratchy, and when she would lie down flat she felt her throat was occluding.  She notes that she is s/p tonsillectomy in 12-2020, and considered whether that was playing a role in her symptoms, but she had not had any of those throat symptoms for 1 week prior to getting her COVID-19 vaccine.  In the ED, she was given IV medications and IV fluids.  ENT was consulted.  Her symptoms got better with medications, she is still experiencing some throat dryness but otherwise is feeling back to her usual self.  She never had any rash, flushing, itching.  She had a little tenderness at the injection site only.  She never had any difficulty breathing, lip/eye/tongue swelling, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, vomiting/diarrhea/abdominal pain.  She did have nausea when she felt vertigo.

I wear an Apple Watch and notice my heart rate was steadily climbing. I asked the exit secretaries to be seen by a nurse and as they were getting a nurse my heart rate reached 169 and I was feeling faint and beginning to shake. When the nurse came she noticed how white my hands were and my breathing was becoming labored. The nurse called a code white and an ICU nurse and respiratory specialist arrived to assess me. I thought I would pass out and they had me lay on my back with legs up. They tested my blood sugar and were assessing my vitals. My breathing was fast but I was still able to breathe. My heart rate started to slow down but remained somewhat high. they helped me into a wheelchair and escorted me to the emergency department. I was assessed for cardiac concerns and labs were taken. After a couple of hours in the ED the dizziness started to subside but I had excessive thirst and dry mouth and slightly swollen tongue. I had feeling of butterflies in my stomach off an on. My heart rate stabilized and I was cleared to go home after four hours.

                                                I felt tremendous body aches all day (the following day), my skin even hurt to touch lightly and a headache.  I took Motrin and even needed Vicodin for the pain.  No fever or nausea.  This is still better than getting COVID and I am just reporting for data purposes.  I was told that this symptom could occur after the second dose.  Some people are talking about blood type being a factor, I am not sure if that is true, but I am A&#43; if that helps. Vaccine on Friday, Saturday felt horrible and Sunday was back to normal.

                                                Within 5 minutes after shot my lips were feeling tingly. at 15 minutes out a co-worker sat by me and I told her about my lips and she commented that I had a large red mark/rash on my neck. I went to the nurse and she asked if I was nervous - which I was. She told me that I should take a Benadryl. I took a single Benadryl.  I went home and was still feeling the tingling sensation and had the rash which had spread onto my chest.  I took another Benadryl about one hour after the initial shot. This reduced the rash and tingling sensation. as it wore off about 4.5 hours later the rash, tingling lips and facial swelling started to appear. I took two more Benadryl and called the on call doctor at my physicians office.  He advised me to continue taking Benadryl until 48 hours after the vaccine, I did this every 4-5 hours including waking during the night to keep up on it. I was also taking Advil at this point to try to help with the swelling and a dull headache that had set in. I should note that I have never had any facial injections or anything like unto it. For 40 hours post vaccine I did this. After 48  hours the symptoms seemed to go away. I did start feeling a metallic taste in my mouth that night and the following night so I took a single Benadryl at bedtime those nights and that seemed to resolve it. I have had a slight cough and congestion on days 3-6 when I woke up in the morning, but that would resolve itself within an hour of being up. The doctor on call that I spoke with the first night did advise me to still get the second dose, but to take some Benadryl ahead of time and to make sure that the clinic has a current EpiPen on site.

Other than arm pain, I am fine today.

                                                In addition to some of the expected symptoms (arm soreness, chills, headache) I experienced the most debilitating sciatica pain from 18-36 hours post shot. I thought  my back condition was worsening but honestly think it was an effect. Nothing I had been using for pain relief helped. I was in agony during that period. Agitated.  At 5AM on 1/29/21, I woke up soaked in sweat and finally had some pain relief. From that point on, my pain returned to my normal level.  I never reported this to any healthcare professional since at the time, I did not think this pain was related (also not sure what could have been done).

The next day, muscle aches &amp; chills continued, and were joined by exhaustion, fatigue, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, migraines, chest congestion (for one day).  The symptoms continued to worsen each day, and on 2/09, I vomited and went to the clinic.  I tested negative for Covid-19, (both the rapid and 3 day tests), negative for the flu, negative for strep.  I started taking Excedrin for the migraines, and it helped, but prior to that, no medicine was working.  I continued to rest and take Excedrin.  Daily symptoms continued to include:  migraine, fatigue, chills &amp; aches, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, could only warm drinks &amp; bland food.  Also nausea, short of breath.  These symptoms continued to slowly improve, but I had them through 2/19.

                                                I developed fever of 101.7, had rigors, sweats, bone and muscle ache. I experienced a zapping sensation in my head that traveled down to my jaw. It felt like an electric shock that lasted a few seconds .It went from top of my head to my left jaw and ear. If felt the pain in my back molars.  This happened at least 15 times. In a 24 hour period. It was not a headache.

                                                Received vaccine on 3/3/21 at 2:30pm. Waited for 20 minutes at pharmacy for allergic reaction. Given the all clear, so headed home. Around 5pm, I started noticing how extremely sore my left arm was, almost as if somebody had hit it with a baseball bat (no bruising, redness, etc., just VERY sore). I also started noticing numbness and tingling in my left arm that traveled down the outside of my arm into my left hand and into my left pinky finger.   As the evening progressed, I lost my appetite, developed a headache, felt extremely fatigued, was dizzy, had muscle and joint aches, had left kidney pain, and began to feel flushed and hot. I took my temperature and it showed I was running a low-grade fever of 98.7F (my normal temperature is anywhere between 96.9F and 97.1F). I went to bed around 9pm.  Around 3am (which is now 3/4/21), I woke up with nausea, and my left arm/hand/finger really experiencing numbness and tingling (it&#39;s as if that portion of my arm/hand/finger was semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was on the verge of throwing up. I broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed and went back to sleep.  Around 5am (still 3/4/21), I woke up again with nausea and my left arm/hand/finger still numb and tingling (semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was again on the verge of throwing up. I, again, broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed. I decided to take a Zofran around 6am for the nausea.  I slept from 8am-12pm on 3/4/21 due to the Zofran. When I woke up, I called the pharmacist at pharmacy to notify them of my symptoms. The pharmacist everything I experienced was normal and should go away in 2-3 days (if they didn&#39;t then contact my regular doctor), that I could take Tylenol for any pain, and I still needed to keep my follow-up appointment for the second shot.  The entire day on 3/4/21 from 12pm until I went to bed around 10pm, I still experienced an extremely sore arm, loss of appetite, slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint aches, left kidney pain, low-grade fever (for me), and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.  I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up around 6am on 3/5/21. Currently, I am still experiencing an extremely sore arm, fatigue, and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger. I am EXTREMELY concerned about the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger as it does not seem to be getting better.

I have a previous history of fillers in my tear trough areas and cheeks, last filler injection was January 2020.  I have some swelling under the right eye too.  I have read about that being caused by an immune reaction to the filler after vaccine administration.   I have not treated the swelling , as I want to see how long it persists.

And then around 2330 on 12/31/20 she experienced facial swelling, arm swelling, headache, chills, and dizziness.  EE stated she felt it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine and took Benadryl for the next 24 hours to help with the symptoms.  EE reported she hasn&#39;t had anything since the initial 24 hours, but is concerned about taking the next vaccine.  Encouraged EE to contact PCP regarding concern for taking next vaccine.  After speaking with Administration, EE encouraged to report vaccine side effects to CDC via V-Safe (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html).

The next day where the welts were my arm is now red and warm feeling.; Slightly itchy.  My arm has felt heavy like a swollen feeling although not swollen - as if my arm was asleep.

                                                Initial swelling and soreness right after injection.  Swelling and pain continued for the next few days, Motrin 800mg and Benadryl 25mg  at bedtime were taken.  Swelling and pain persisted.  Area became hard, red, itchy and raised over the holiday.  Swelling, redness and itchiness became worse over the weeknd into Monday. I was unable to lift my arm, bring it behind my back or reach.  It was very painful and hot.   I then contacted employee health.  They did not feel it was infected but was the delayed reaction to the moderna vaccine.  I did not feel comfortable with this and I then contacted my physician who looked at it and felt it was in fact cellulitis, I was sent for a ultrasound to rule out a blood clot and labs and an IV infusion of Rocephin as well as oral antibiotics.  I received my first infusion yesterday.  The swelling has improved greatly, however the redness has spread beyond the marked area on my arm and I will be receiving another dose of IV Rocephin today.  My labs showed my CRP was elevated  and my ALT/AST were elevated as well.

After several scratches to alleviate the itchiness I checked the site &amp; noticed that where the vaccine was administered was red &amp; warm to the touch.  It progressively started getting more itchy.  Then the muscle soreness started.  It felt as if I just had the injection.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  We had at least 7 different patients all receive their Moderna vaccine on the same day complain of the same thing 7-8 days later. They all had delayed injection site reaction, swollen arm, and warm to touch. All advised to use a warm compress and take antihistamines or tylenol/ibuprofen as needed. This appears to be quite a common response. I want to report it but not submitting all 7 patients separately.  As far as I know, they have all resolved.

The unbalanced feeling, dizziness, weakness ,and occasional palpatations remain. I had a covid test done on 1/6/2021.I had sinus pain started on 1/8/2021. I am being treated for possible sinus infection with Augmentin that I started on 1/11/2021 but my symptoms are still present . I have been unable to work because when I walk I feel dizzy and unsteady.  I have follow up with my primary doctor on 1/18/2021.

                                                increasing LN along  right clavicle and then among right cervical chain these past few days. about 4-5 of them with the largest on on distal right clavicle and about 1cm in size. They&#39;re all mobile.No other symptoms to speak of.  No fever, no sore throat, no redness/swelling anywhere. Some mild baseline tiredness. I had some soreness in upper arm the first few days after the vaccine , some vague right shoulder/upper back pain last weekend that I attributed to muscle strain from overuse. I noted the 2 larger 1cm lymph nodes by mid-right clavicle 4 days ago, and the 2 smaller 0.5cm right sided lower cervical chain LNs 2 days ago.

The next day the arm was still very sore and I had very little energy and total body aches.  I self medicated with 600mg of Ibuprofin several times through out the day.  My injected arm was 4 degrees warmer on the surface than my non-injected arm; as measured with an infrared thermometer.   I felt like when I had actually had Covid 91 days prior.  The next day I was about half as bad as the day before, and I was able to return to work on Monday.  The injected arm remained sore for more than a week at the injection site.  I also experienced some swelling of lymph nodes under my arm.

Pt admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation secondary to angioedema from Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. Pt presented with a chief complaint of tongue and facial swelling approximately 10 minutes after receiving first dose of the vaccination. She did not respond to Benadryl or IM epinephrine. She was admitted to ICU and intubated. She was started on IVsteroids, famotidine and diphenhydramine. Swelling gradually improved and she was successfully extubated.  Her hospital course was complicated by steroid-induced hyperglycemia requiring insulin.

                                                At injection, some vaccine trickled out of the arm. Increased soreness and swelling that day and for the next few days resolved on their own. Same day as injection, I experienced mild nausea and dizziness. Resolved with rest and time by the end of the day. On 1/23, my left arm at the injection site was swollen, hot, and red. Large red area present that grew bigger the next day. No other symptoms. Was prescribed Keflex on Sunday (1/24)  by covering HCP (telephone call). Saw my dermatologist for a scheduled appointment who said it was not cellulitis but a delayed allergic reaction. I stopped Keflex on 1/26. On 1/27, symptoms have improved. Small circumference, less redness, and swelling.

My throat did not close, but it clenched or got tight and my tongue seemed to tense.  Before I had time to think about that, I had a surge of adrenaline which left me a bit startled.  The tongue and throat tightening happened without an adrenaline surge approximately 4 more times.  I lost feeling in my left arm and felt lightheaded.  This lasted about 30 minutes, after which I felt fine.  I experienced sharp stabbing pains in hands, feet, pelvis and fingers, which are still present 48 hours later.  At 24 hours post-vaccine, I felt chills and developed muscle aches and a low fever, which are still present at 48 hours post-vaccine.

It is warm to the touch and slightly itchy/burning.

At 7pm the same evening I developed a fever of 101.2, chills, headache, nausea, severe fatigue and weakness. 24 hrs after the vaccine I was so weak I could not get out of bed, chills, fever, nausea, body-aches, fatigue. I also noticed my whole left arm was swollen. At 48 hrs I had the sweats, chills, fever, body-aches, fatigue, swollen left arm and a 6cm x 6cm circle of hot erythema around the injection site. At 72 hrs most symptoms were gone but I was still fatigued, area around injection site  no longer red but where the erythema was it itched.

                                                1 week after injection I woke up with severely swollen lymph nodes in neck, swollen throat and could barely swallow. Right arm at site of injection 1 week prior was acutely hard, elevated, red, warm and tender to touch.  I immediately took a benadryl and 5 mg predniosne tablet, water, elevated position to rest. Swelling of lymph nodes in neck improved and gradually resolved 3-4 days later. Right arm redness and size of affected area doubled over the next two days, but then started improving. Resolved in about 8 days.

No other signs or symptoms of allergic reaction (no hives/rash, no swelling in any other areas). At the time of this reporting , the swelling has improved  a lot.  I read a possible correlation with lip filler recipients. I did receive lip filler approximately 1 to 1.5yrs ago.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; Angioedema; Shortness of breath; Wheezing; Fast heart rate; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 44-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced an anaphylaxis reaction, angioedema, shortness of breath, wheezing, and increased heart rate.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 20 Jan 2021 at 18:00, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection, the patient began to have tongue swelling. She was given diphenhydramine and epinephrine by epi pen. She went to the emergency room where she displayed symptoms including a fast heart rate, wheezing, and shortness of breath with an angioedema or anaphylaxis like appearance. She was given more epinephrine, famotidine, scheduled diphenhydramine at 50 QAs intravenously (IV), IV steroids, was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She was on the ventilator for approximately 18-20 hours following admission. She eventually responded to a high dose of dexamethasone. She was also given duonebs for her shortness of breath, regular sedation for the ventilator, and a dose of ketorolac. Consent was given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events were unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred approximately 10 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration. She was treated with epinephrine, famotidine, diphenhydramine, IV steroids, intubated and placed on a ventilator.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                8 days after the vaccine, I developed a blotchy red rash that trailed down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was red, swollen and painful to touch. Mild itchiness noted on that arm. Otherwise, I was fine. Just seemed strange so long after the vaccination. It improved without intervention and was gone within 2-3 days. I did not seek professional help because I read that this reaction was noted with the Moderna vaccine and that it was just considered a mounting immune response and no cause for concern.  However, I still thought I should report it. I have since received the second dose of vaccine on 2/19/21. I had moderate side effects starting on 2/20/21 (lasting 15 hours) of fatigue, chills, body aches, joint pain, headache, generalized body swelling, swelling and pain at injection site and brain fog. I didn?t experience a rash (yet- the vaccine was only 3 days ago). Will update if that changes.

                                                Mild dizziness started within 5 minutes. Within 20 minutes my tongue started to swell, but only the front to middle part, not the back part. I was still able to breathe. After 25 minutes, I was unable to stand and nearly passed out twice trying to get to some place safe.  I could not verbally communicate and was lacked strength to move. I started drinking as many fluids as possible with the assistance of family. Symptoms began to subside after 3 hrs. After 4 hrs, I regained strength and was not dizzy if I stayed in place. I continued to push fluids and rested. I needed to be careful not to drink anything too cold as i would develop the chills. The next day, there was no dizziness but I was very groggy. I continued to push fluids. I would develop a headache if I did not drink at 16 oz every hour. The following day, I was still groggy, but was functional and felt okay to drive.

                                                On day 12 (February 20), patient noticed some pain under her left bra strap (below the clavicle).   On day 13 (February 21), she noticed a bump about the size of a pea under the clavicle. At the injection site, she described her arm as being a little blotchy, sore and mildly swollen but it does not itch. She also felt a little tired and had a mild headache.  She took a nap and felt better.  On day 14 (February 22) the injection site reaction continues and the pea-sized bump under the bra strap (under the clavicle) remains, and the whole left side of the breast feels a little achy.   Patient wants to get dose 2 and plans to request it be administered in the right arm instead.

Went to emergency room and was given Benedryl, Epinephrine, Pepcid, and Solumedrol.  Kept in ER for 8 hours, Throat still swollen, but better, provided second doses of Benedryl and Epinephrine, then admitted for observation for 24 hours.   Throat and swallowing difficulties continued for approximately 3 days after discharge.   Hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, having to push liquids and food into diaphram was uncomfortable.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

                                                Slight right  facial numbness half hour post administration lasting 30 mins. Chills and Rt arm site pain and swelling on the first night. 2nd night, chills and increased swelling, pain to right arm site with slight weeping, warm to touch and redness. Throughout the first two weeks, I would have intermittent chills and right arm site redness, swelling, pain, warmth was gradually getting better but did not have any fever the first 13 days.  The night of 2/15/2021, I felt the chills, body aches and went to sleep. All night I felt I was about to get a fever. I was in bed until 1pm the next day on 2/16/21 when I started to have the severe tremors with my chills, back spasms, abdominal pain, and nausea. I got out of bed, took my temp and it was 101.5 F orally. I tried to take Tylenol but I could not because as soon as I sipped some water, I started vomiting yellow emesis first and then later on I was already vomiting greenish bile. I was getting weaker, lethargic and my tremors and chills were getting worst as well as my back spasms and abdominal pain. My husband, then brought me to the ER around 2:30-3pm. I was admitted in ICU for septic shock with unknown source on that day, 2/16/2021. I was on levophed drip via right chest central venous catheter for 48 hours and was given multiple antibiotics until discharged to home on 2/20/21. I developed red facial rashes more prominent to the right side on the second day of admission. Two days after discharge, I had headaches for two days with right shoulder pain. But, on the next day which was the 3rd day post hospitalization, I broke out with generalized reddened, raised, itchy and burning rashes. My husband brought me back to the ER on that day on 2/24/21. ER MD loaded me with dexamethasone steroid IV and Benadryl IV and sent me home with oral dexamethasone and anti-histamine orally. I saw my primary MD on 2/26/2021 for hospital follow up and referred me to Infectious disease MD and Endriconologist. On March 3rd, I was started on insulin SQ due to my blood sugars running 300?s to almost 400. As of now, my MD is still adjusting my insulin dosage due to persistent high blood sugar readings of 300-400 mg/dL.

Day 2: residual headache (50%), tiredness, weakness, sweating if doing things, residual knee joint pain, sense of smell/taste returned and heightened. Day 3: residual headache (25%), still not 100%, residual knee joint pain. Day 4 (today):  residual knee joint pain (comes and goes). I realize that these are not symptoms of an allergic reaction, but severe side effects.

                                                7 days (4 Jan 21) after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine the injection site became red, swollen and hot to the touch. My skin feels like it is burning. I went to employee health the next day ( 5 Jan 21). The physician looked at it, tried to find pictures of reactions on the internet and then drew an ink pen line around the redness. Left an approximate 1/8th inch border. Told me to come back if it went past the lines. Within 12 hours it has swollen past the lines. My entire arm feels like it?s burning.

                                                About 4-5 minutes after receiving the shot, experienced heart racing (180 bpm), and feeling faint.  Breathing was fine.  Felt slightly tight in the throat.  Also experienced diarrhea twice within the 40 minutes following the vaccine.   The heart racing and faint feeling lasted about 5 minutes.  The throat tightness lasted closer to 1.5 hours, but was never severe- just noticeable.  Within 2 hours of the vaccine, was feeling much better.  Never experienced actual difficulty breathing.  I reported to employee health RN and personal physician.

Her vitals were taken and were stable. After 5 more minutes her hands stopped tingling and within 15 minutes her throat symptoms resolved. She continued to have tongue tingling without any facial or tongue swelling. After 25 minutes a physician was contacted and cetirizine 10mg was administered. 25 minutes later her symptoms were resolved and her vitals are stable. She was allowed to go home after that time and was advised to follow up to her PCP.

She denies any pain or difficulty moving her shoulder, states the area is itchy.  No fever/body aches/chills.  No headache.  She has had similar reactions to the Pneumovax vaccine, was treated for cellulitis.  She has not tried any home treatments, not taking anything for pain, since there is no pain.  No chronic medical problems or regular medications. Findings most consistent with localized reaction vs cellulitis, encouraged symptomatic treatment with cool compress, NSAIDs, etc.  Counseled patient that this should not prevent her from receiving a second dose of the vaccine.

About 1 pm was sitting at my desk when felt flush and neck hurt. Noted rash across neck and upper torso, swelling at lymph node L side neck area. Area was painful to light touch. Pt (self) went to urgent care to be further evaluated by someone else other than patient, once there began to get worse.  All over tingling but significant at fingers, toes and mouth lips. Unable to talk clearly, but never  became confused. So tired unable to stay awake; difficult to rouse. No difficulty with breathing; Epi was not needed or given. Transported to hospital via EMS due to inability to stay awake and difficulty speaking/unable to stand without assistance. It was very hard to talk - to get the words out - but I never did have any decline in mental thought process and was never disorientated. Looked intoxicated however.  At hospital when pt transferred from stretcher to bed, pt doubled over due to abdominal discomfort - it was where the EKG stickers were. All reflexes noted to be hyper - MD kicked on accident when checking reflexes. the EKG stickers felt like being punched or slapped. Needed assistance transferring. All over numbness/tingling noted. Breathing never affected. Symptoms resolved after a few hours.

The site of my injection has a large (half-dollar size) red rash that is itchy and slightly raised.  A visual examination by 2 providers that I work with (Family Practice office)  today due to extreme itching.  I was instructed to take Ranitidine and Zyrtec at approximately 9am.  It is now 12pm and the itchiness is a little better.

I have a baseball size rash, hot to touch, not painful that started last a Tuesday (six days after injection). At first my arm was a bit sore but nothing more than the flu vaccine. I have drawn a circle around the mark to see if it is increasing in size, it has been increasing each day. I went to dr and they. Told me they don?t know what is causing this but put me on an antibiotic. I am scheduled for second vaccine on Jan 25th. Not sure if I should still get this.

                                                6 days post vaccination (12/23/20),  I developed painful supra clavicular and axillary lymph nodes.  On day 7 itching, hive like red area over injection site, left upper arm. I made an appt with PCP as a precaution.   She thought the area over the injection site could be an allergic reaction or wants to monitor for potential cellulitis.    Lymph nodes are possible immune response to vaccine.   Day 8 area slightly larger and more painful area over injection site.   Have sent  message and picture to PCP. Lymph nodes still enlarged and painful.

                                                24 hours after vaccine developed a red rash and swelling. Started to go away on day 6. On day 7 the rash got worse and spread over my arm. Took Benadryl and Claritin with good results. Rash seemed to go away. On day 12 rash came back and spread over a bigger portion of my Left arm and I have had to start taking Benadryl and Claritin again. Rash is itchy and site is swollen but responds well to Benadryl. But now a bigger portion of my arm is affected

                                                Approximately 25 mins post Moderna COVID-19 vaccination, pt had bilateral hand swelling and her throat started to fell scratchy.   50mg IM Benadryl administered in R arm within 1 minute. Pt has no difficulty breathing, no urticaria, hives, redness or visible swelling on chest, face, or neck.  Post Benadryl administration, pt  has no difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, and hand swelling is decreasing.  Pt states she feels slightly dizzy and was briefly nauseous after Benadryl admin.  Pt wants to refuse.  EMS called a medical center for high-risk refusal and a doctor gave permission to refuse.  Pt&#39;s husband is driving pt home and will monitor pt for next 24 hours.  EMS also called Poison Control, who said there&#39;s nothing they can or will do. Our Medical Director was consulted and advised EMS to patch for HRR and to have pt follow up with an immunologist/allergist before receiving dose 2 of Moderna V&#43;COVID-19 vaccination.  Our EMS Chief will be following up with the patient later today.

Starting on  Monday, Jan 11, I noticed soreness and the area around the injection site was  hard.  This continued until Friday Jan 15th but I also noticed swelling, the area is warm to the touch and skin redness.  I took 1000mg of Tylenol.  Today Saturday, Jan 16th I currently have soreness, skin redness, the are is swollen and is warm to the touch and it is hard.

                                                Sore arm, mild cold symptoms on Day 1 &amp; 2, was expected, didn&#39;t worry. Then all was normal again until Day 9, which was 1/11/21 appx 2:00 am. Sore arm awakened me. Area at and below injection site red, swollen, about 2&#34; x 2&#34; diameter. By 2:00PM, area had grown to 7&#34; x 4&#34;, very swollen, very warm to touch, burning sensation. Got home from work about 7:00pm, took benadryl, applied cool compress and massage, went to sleep. (Had called my doctors office, was waiting for call back.) Next morning about 4:00am, arm didn&#39;t hurt as much, was less red and swollen, but now itched very much. Whole body felt itchy, including inside my ears. I called out sick to work, took more benadryl, and planned to go to urgent care if needed. Doctor called me about 10:00am, waking me from benadryl sleep. They advised observation if no worsening, urgent care if it did. Since then, flat red patch on injection area, mild itch, mild swelling. Co worker just informed us she had same symptoms today (got her vaccine on 1/5/21) &amp; is diagnosed cellulitis &amp; prescribed antibiotics, so now I&#39;m worried about my arm again, and worried about the lot number and reporting this reaction.

On Jan 4 2021 my bp and pulse were elevated, I had increased chest burning, headache and was admitted to the hospital to rule out MI.  The ct scan showed mild pancreatitis, endoscopy negative. I didn?t have a period for the month of Jan and I am neg for pregnancy. I continue to have esophageal, chest and back burning. I feel better now. I am scheduled to have my second vaccine Thursday Jan 21st and I am nervous. Not sure if this is an adverse reaction or coincidence.

Friday morning, it had faded and two smaller rash dots away from the vaccine site appeared. By Friday at 10pm the lower dot about inches from the site of the vaccine was the size of a 50-cent piece and warm to the touch, and the other spot had faded. Then Saturday morning it had increased in size and became itchy. This morning around 6:50am the size had increased to about 2.5 inches and two more rash spots approximately 1 inch across appeared toward the site of the injection. Urgent care suggested monitoring it since no other symptoms were present, as well as reporting to the site where the vaccine administered .

                                                8 hours after vaccine severe injection site pain/swelling, severe body aches, 101.0 temp.  16 hours after vaccine woke up from sleeping with flushed skin, facial swelling, and throat swelling. I immediately took 100mg of Benadryl and went to hospital emergency room.  Approximately 30-40 minutes later symptoms started to lessen.  Once at the ER, at the same time symptoms began to resolve, I was given PO Solumedrol and Pepcid.  I was monitored and then discharged with RX for prednisone, and EPIPEN (to use if needed).  No other issues with allergic reaction.  Mild injection site soreness, mild body aches, 99.3 temp persist at 36 hours post injection.

Mild symptoms of warmth, erythema, tenderness, swelling upon waking the morning of 1/18/2021. Mild fever and headache, and flaring of asthma symptoms also noted. Erythematous area has spread/worsened every day since onset.  Seems to decrease with use of benadryl, not to Claritin or Zyrtec. Ice packs reduce discomfort. Today is day 5 of reaction and it does not seem to be resolving.  I have been in contact with my doctor&#39;s office 2 times since onset.

I ended up developing  Covid Symptoms on 1-30-21, on that same day my bottom lip began swelling.  The first day it was just the left side of my bottom lip. This lasted about three hours. The next day the right side of my bottom lip began swelling and very itchy. I took an antihistamine, swelling went down in a little over an hour, itching continued for a couple more hours. The doctor informed me that they are not sure if it is a reaction to the vaccine, covid, or a combination of both. They told me to report the reaction on this website.

                                                About 11 hours after vaccine, my temperature went up to 101.5 - pounding headaches and dizzy. No digestive issues this time. My arm was very sore again - not quite as bad as first time. Body aches - general. I woke up drenched in sweat about 4 am in the morning - I went and took a shower and went back to bed. Tuesday, temperature was doing up and down - 100.5 or .6 down to 96.7. Normally I&#39;m 97.2 or 97.4. My arm was sore. By Wednesday, I was feeling much better - 99.3 - 99.8 (may have not hit 100 degrees). My arm was sore but not as achy so it was better on Wednesday. By Thursday, I was feeling a lot better. It didn&#39;t last as long as first dose.. I was able to work after that.

                                                I am quoting this from my mother as she is currently unable to type due to the shaking and shivering. &#34;It started with red hot places on both arms, and then it moved to my face. 2 1/2 hours later I began getting really nauseated and began shaking/shivering uncontrollably. I then went to urgent care and on the way there my heart was pounding and racing. After I was admitted they told me that I had tachycardia and my blood pressure was high (I do not usually have high blood pressure). They did an EKG at urgent care and noticed small changes. I was then sent to the ER and was given IV Benadryl and oral steroids. I was put on a heart monitor, and they were able to get my heart rate to go down, but a few hours later it jumped back up. At that point I was referred to a cardiologist and given a prescription for steroids, and then I was discharged. I saw the cardiologist 2 days later, during those two days I still experienced red hot spots on my arm, shortness of breath, Tachycardia, and shivering. When I went to the cardiologist, they did another EKG and said I still have tachycardia and did some bloodwork. The results of the bloodwork were normal and the cardiologist diagnosed it as an unspecified delayed severe allergic reaction. I am still experiencing symptoms and still having to use Benadryl and steroids.&#34;

                                                Felt flushed and arm swelled up at injection site to size of a gold ball. Hospital staff supervising required ingestion of 25 mg Benadryl immediately upon reaction. Was monitored for 40 min and sent home from work. Within  a few hours began to feel body aches and headache.  Over the next few hours developed low grade fever 99.6. Pain at the injection site , which I was expecting.  I called employee health and reported my symptoms. Was instructed to take ibuprofen or Tylenol for symptom management, to hydrate and rest. Took 600mg ibuprofen. That evening, the same symptoms became worse and I became very weak and nauseous. Also my heart rate became elevated . I usually sit in the 50-60s as I?m an avid exerciser. My HR remained in the 90s- low 100s over the next 48 hrs . The following day (day 2) I had all the same symptoms despite taking 600 mg ibuprofen around the clock. Continued to notify employee health as instructed.  Day 3, I had to return to work, temp (with 600 mg ibuprofen on board) was 99.2. I was still achy and headache and weak but less than the previous days. Notified employee health again &amp; was instructed to get a covid test the following day if symptoms didn?t subside.  Day 4 , the symptoms mostly passed. No fever . No body aches. No more heart racing only very slight nausea . Very slight headache. Energy mostly returned. Pain at injection site replaced by itching and bruise at injection site.

                                                Following the vaccine I was slightly dizzy, after 25 minutes my chest started to get tight, had difficulty breathing, racing heart rate, some constriction in the throat.  I was taken to the ER, used Proair inhaler on the way to ER to ease breathing,  O2 sat slightly decreased but returned to normal in the ER.  Due to difficulty breathing, I had some increased anxiety which lessened after breathing became easier.  Nebulizer treatment given in the ER.  Benadryl 25mg taken.  Rash on L arm and upper chest, burning and pain in L arm.  Benadryl taken for 2 days due to returning rash and burning in arm.  Nebulizer treatments every 4 hrs on the day of the vaccine due to continued tightness and difficultly breathing.  The following day I had fatigue, slight fever, pain of 7 out of 10 in L arm, headache, neck and muscle pain.  Followed up w/ primary care physician on 12/29/2020, he advised not to take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  L arm pain lessened to 4 out of 10 on 12/30/2020.  L arm pain dissipated on 12/31/2020, but headache, neck pain and fatigue continued through 1/1/2021

January 1 I developed a rash on my arm around the site of the injection- raised rash, itchy, hot to the touch. Rash began growing in size, with increased symptoms of shoulder pain/aching, headache, low grade fever-100. I took 3 Benadryl and put hydrocortizone cream on it,. By this morning it decreased in puffiness/swelling and redness, but has spread to cover my entire upper left arm and is still like that.

Between 1-2 hours after injection, I noticed a little bit of a scratchy throat,  increased thirst, and mild headache. No treatment required.  I took Benadryl and Tylenol when I returned home from my shift at work about 4 hours after the injection. The next day, 1/3/21, scratchy throat had disappeared.  I felt tired, slight fever of 99.5, increased thirst, and very sore arm.   On 1/4/21, I just have slightly sore arm and a little tired with no fever.  I took Tylenol.

                                                Two hours after the injection, I started to not feel &#34;right.&#34;  My head felt heavy, I was getting a little dizzy and all I wanted to do was to lie down.  By the third hour, my body completely shut down.  I was so tired I had no energy to move, to talk, and even breathing was difficult (not because I couldn&#39;t breathe, just that the effort was difficult).  I was dizzy, nauseous, and lost my appetite.  My temperature was elevated, 98.5, but no fever.  I slept for 5 hours as if in a coma.  Woke up to drink water, felt total-body aches, and slept the rest of the night again getting at least 12 more hours of sleep.  At some point during the night, I had chills so bad my body was shaking uncontrollably.  I had 2 layers of clothes and 3 layers of blankets and could not warm up.  Day #2 (today), I have a tremendous headache, dizzy, nauseous, my heart rate is abnormally fast and I am out of breath.  My resting heart rate is typically upper 50&#39;s and is currently averaging in the 70&#39;s, jumping into the 90&#39;s often.   Sitting up, my heart rate is between 80-100 (which is typically my rate when I exercise).  When I stand up or walk to the other room, my heart rate is around 115-120 (typical of when I am running/sprinting or participating in taxing exercise).  Along with this, I am out of breath as if I am exercising, although I am barely moving around. All I am doing is laying down, only getting up to go to the bathroom and my body feels like I ran a marathon.  Breathing is difficult even at rest.

I took my temperature and had a fever if 99.8.  By the evening of Day 2 the swelling had lessoned not gone and the rest of the symptoms were still present.  Each day got a little better and was slightly itchy.  On Day 7, it started to swell slightly and became redder again and was warm to the touch again.  By Day 7 in the evening it was back to getting better.  Today is 1/13/20 almost 3 weeks later I still have some noticeable discoloration.  Note - When the shot was given I did feel a fairly strong burning sensation during and right after the injection.

                                                &#34;I had the &#39;usual&#39; reaction to the vaccine a week ago on Friday (1/8)--sore, red lump on arm, headache/body aches/fatigue. Everything except the arm was gone by Sunday (1/10). I took some Benadryl on Sunday and the arm appeared to be getting better. The hard lump never went away though and by Friday (1/15) it was huge, red, hot and swollen. Long story short, I ended up with a whopping case of cellulitis and am on some antibiotics. The Dr. was not sure who I should report it to...there&#39;s certainly the possibility that it&#39;s random (I could have ended up with cellulitis even if I was getting a tetanus vaccine or something and I realize that) or if it could be connected to the vaccine not dispersing in my arm?

                                                On 1/14/ 2021 @ aprox 6pm, the injection site suddenly began burning sensation and had a raised white ring around a red hot center. It began as the size of Suzanne b Anthony coin.  Over the course of a few hours the white rind turned I to a larger knot/lump the size of a silver dollar. I began feeling feverish and the entire arm ached. The itch was intense so I used topical anti itch cream in an attempt to subdue the sensation. It helped slightly. I also began oral antihistamines and a fever reducer , following protocol as if I had been stung by a bee/wasp and experience a similar reaction.  On 01/15/2021  in the am I decided to report my reaction via the V-safe app that was given in the pamphlet at the time of the drivethru clinic. It allowed me to set up my profile and make an initial report, however after an hour had passed my arm had continued to swell, itch, and become painful to use and I was unable to continue my daily activities. The swelling had a strange bruising appearance aprx 4inch in size  so I tried to report it to the app. At that point the app would not allow me to report and just kept sending sign in codes that would allow anything. Over the course of the next few days the app kept sending codes but would not allow for anymore updated reporting.  I decided to email our health department who had provided the drive thru vaccinations on 1/7/2021 and 1/8/2021. Thats was 1/14/2021. On 1/16/2021 a reply was finally received with only instructions to contact my person primary care physican. I do not have health care. health Department did send a link to this reporting form.  Today 1/20/2021 the redness and swelling have subsided leaving a faint 6inch discoloration under the skin. The shoulder joint and elbow joint ache dully and the bicep muscle spasms at times of use. Physically I feel better at the time of this statement. I did take a couple of pictures at the beginning of the reaction of the affected area/arm.  Others in our area on these same dates gave experienced delayed reactions to different degrees as well.

My eyes became slightly swollen, I developed a (non-itchy) rash on my cheeks and across my nose, and a fever. My tongue also was partially numb. After about 1 hour, the tongue swelling significantly decreased and the rash began to calm. About 3 hours after the vaccine I developed severe nausea (no vomiting), body aches, and a headache. My face was also partially numb. Today I woke up with severe body aches, fever, headache, nausea, diarrhea, very sore arm.

Next evening the rash spread and by day 5 the rash spread more.  Redness, tenderness, stinging &amp; burning sensation / pustules I contacted PCP due to worsening spread of rash and informed I had shingles. I provided pictures of the rash from day 2, 3 and 5. PCP consulted Infectious Disease colleague who confirmed shingles. I was instructed to get Immunoglobulin G antibody testing, which I did, on 1/26/21. Currently awaiting lab results. Informed that I may need anti-viral and anti-biotic depending on lab results. There was NO illness, new medication, change in diet, soaps, perfumes or laundry detergents prior to 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccination.

                                                Angioedema of arm, face, and tongue; Difficulty swallowing; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 46-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed angioedema arm, face, and tongue and difficulty swallowing probably due to swelling.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included penicillin allergy, seasonal allergies, dermatological fillers and collagen fillers. Concomitant medications included Redopx and Aloim.   On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 041L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had swelling, angioedema of the arm, face and tongue. She also had difficulty swallowing, probably due to the swelling per the reporter. Treatment for the event included prednisone and diphenhydramine.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed angioedema arm, face, and tongue and difficulty swallowing probably due to swelling, were considered resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 46-year-old female patient with relevant medical history of penicillin allergy, seasonal allergies, dermatological fillers and collagen fillers who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 041L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Patient experienced the serious unlisted event of angioedema of the arm, face, and tongue and serious unlisted event of difficulty swallowing probably due to swelling. Treatment for the events included prednisone and diphenhydramine which resolved the events. Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the events occurring after receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events of angioedema of the arm, face, and tongue and difficulty swallowing are possibly related to the product.

                                                Just prior to 5P had left arm pain -that traveled to my hand. At 5PM driving and heart rate went 128 - most likely higher (registered on iwatch). This is abnormal for me as my heart rate is typically in high 40&#39;s (marathon runner).  Along with the rapid heart rate felt like throat was closing - like a reaction caused by an allergy.  The rate rate stayed like that for about a minute or two followed by severe chills (chills can be described like when a person comes out of the OR).  I felt like I was coming out of my skin and became dizzy. I became nervous and called 911.  In discussion with the 911 dispatch everything subsided and decided I would continue driving with an intent to going to Hospital.  About 10 minutes later, prior to getting onto I95 the same cycle with increased heart rate followed by chills occurred again for about the same timeframe.  I do not know how far apart the cycle was occurring other than I ended up calling 911 again and Ambulance was dispatched while I was on I95 and I had pulled over.  Approx arrival of ambulance was about 6P Once in the back of the ambulance, I showed no arrhythmia and heart rate was now in the 70&#39;s, however I was still having the chills.  Decided to drive home after waiting about 20 minutes in the back of ambulance with no further issues of the tachycardia. Once I was home I continued with chills and a high fever throughout the night.  The fever did not go away until about 48 hours. The chills went away by the following morning. Thursday and Friday have had chest tightness and the feeling of needing to take large breaths to expand chest.  Continue to have moderate headache.

Per staff, she was wheezing initially. She was taken to the triage area, supplemental oxygen applied, vital signs obtained: BP 164/98mmHg, HR 97, RR 21. O2 saturation initially marginal (87% on RA), corrected with 6 Liters of NC supplemental oxygen. BP stable in the 140-160&#39;s/80&#39;s range. HR initially in the 90s, then fluctuated between 100-120&#39;s subsequently. She was observed for 30 minutes, during which time she had 5 episodes of intermittent tachypnea, c/o feeling hot, dizzy and chest tightness. Patient states that she has h/o anxiety and ADHD, taking Adderall and Prozac. She had prior anxiety attacks but this one does not feel like anxiety per patient. She further reports that she had some reaction to her 1st dose of Moderna vaccine (on 1/9/2021) with headache, fever, hallucination, tiredness, loss of taste and smell on 1/10/2021.  She was given 2 puffs of albuterol inhaler without significant improvement at 15:45pm. At this point, given no notable resolution of her cyclic tachypnea, EMS was called at 15:50. Care was transferred to EMS at 15:53.  During this entire episode, there was no wheezing, no rash, no hive, no stridor. She was maintaining normal sensorium, talking to staff throughout, drinking sips of water.

Redness spread to an area of about 3 inches. The next morning, I felt fine. Through the week, this area faded but did not disappear completely. About a week later, on Sunday, Feb 21, the area on my arm grew to around 6 inches or more: red, swollen, itchy, warm to the touch, worse than the week before. I saw my family doctor on Monday, Feb 22 and they determined it was not infected, just a local histamine reaction. They advised Benadryl and a topical steroid to deal with symptoms.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving injection in right arm I felt a BOOM flush all over my body like I just had an IV Contrast.  Then I became dizzy, my heart started racing, I started cold sweats and felt tightness in my mid upper chest to the base of my throat.  The ED RN on site took my BP and HR and had me lie down because I felt that I couldn&#39;t breath.  She called paramedics who took my BP and HR, then did a 12 lead EKG.  They transported me to the ED.  I was worked up for cardiac, lung, chemistry.  My troponin-HS was slightly elevated and a cardiologist was called.  He did an echo on my heart, liver and right kidney -- normal.  Chest X-ray was normal.  A second 12 lead EKG was done, normal sinus.  Hematology, Chemistry was normal.  Was in the ED from 11:30 to 4:00 p.m.  Advised by ED Doctor, and Cardiologist, that it seems the stress of the anaphylaxis reaction stressed the heart which caused the spill of troponin.  Advised to see my cardiologist and get a stress test.  I have already informed my Primary Care Doctor and he has prescribed me an EPI-PEN to carry.  I have no history of allergic reactions/anaphylaxis reactions to vaccines.  I am up to date with all other vaccines and just had my yearly flu shot in November 2020.  This was my first allergic reaction/anaphylaxis reaction to a vaccine.

The next day was still numb on and off took benadryl 50mg. The morning of 01/02/21 called the covid vaccine hotline and directed me to go to the ER. I went that day to Saint Rachael&#39;s and was given steroids and sent home. I picked up a prescriptions for steroids 60mg 3xtimes a day and had EPI pen as well. So, after taking the steroids prescription i was starting to feel some numbness on the left arm again. And it continues with pain on the site of injection and some numbing.

Headache, fatigue, joint pain, lymph nodes under arm were very painful for about week. And of course pain at injection site. On 09 Jan 2021  a red rash appeared and itching. It is also warm to the touch on left arm at or around the injection site. (concerned about this sense it appeared a week later.) Did not have this for a week.   After all the symptoms went away.

I had been treating the hives with alcohol and anti-itch cream along with Ice packs. As of today 1/11/2021 the hives and swollen lymph node are gone and I feel much better. I reached out to the CDC and they could not explain what the reaction was about nor have they heard of the symptoms. I called my PCP and I&#39;m waiting on him to call me back. I am not sure about getting the second dose due on 1/28/2021.

It lasted about two days. She stated then that her lymph nodes under her arm on that side got really swollen and sore.  That started after the muscles soreness at the injection site dissipated. States it was fairly significant and that she could see swelling for a few days and feel it for several more, up to six more days.   States the lymph node swelling was probably the worst Jan 4 ? 6, and was still noticeable on Jan 9.  By Jan 10 is was basically gone.  States she has also noticed some very mild, intermittent itchiness on that shoulder near the injection site in the last few days. Pt states it used to be hard, warm and hot but has since decreased leaving her with some itchiness.

This started several days after the vaccination.  My doctor recommended that I take Benadryl.  I took one Benadryl the night of 1/6/21 but the redness did not abate.  I applied topical Benadryl twice a day for the next 2 or 3 days and the redness is gone.  The lymph node is still noticeably swollen but otherwise fine.

                                                I initially developed soreness from the vaccine. Then on day 2-3 my arm became red in about a quarter size. That increased to golf-ball size. The pain went away and the redness stayed for a day or two more. It went away, then came back with itching and hives on around day 6. It cleared up again and came back a third time. This time baseball sized, measuring 6 cm x 7 cm in a circle with a dark red ring that was raised at times. It was itchy, warm and firm to the touch. I took Benadryl 25 mg on day 14, it started clearing up on day 15 and is totally gone at this time.

Headache, fatigue, joint pain  were noted for approximately after 24-72 hours and again on days 6 and 7 after injection, along with red circular rash at injection site that was about size of a quarter on right upper arm that became  apparent 24 hours after injection. Rash was also hot to the touch, and itchy.  Approximately on day 6 after injection, rash became raised, felt firm and spread in diameter to  approximately 3-3.5 inches, rash was raised and firm off and on for several days.  By day 12 after injection, rash was starting to lighten in color but was continuing to grow in size to approximately 5 inches in diameter, it was no longer raised or firm, but continued to be hot to the touch and itchy, even with daily use of oral Benadryl and Loratadine . Out of concern that it was not going away on its own contacted PCP on day 14 post vaccine and notified of  situation and office visit made on day 15 post vaccine on 1/14/21 for further assessment. PCP prescribed course of antibiotics (Bactrim x 10 days) as could not  determine if it was  truly infection or localized immune response, or combination of both. Was also prescribed  5 day course of steroids (prednisone) to take prior to and after next COVID vaccine injection.

                                                Started to feel numbness in R side of upper gums in mouth and tingling and numbness at R temple. Soon I was feeling more scattered numbness and tingling on R side of face. After about 15 min, was sort of slurping while talking, like after getting numbing at dentist. No noticeable drooping of R side of face. This more or less resolved after 20-30 min however in the past many days, I feel occasional numbness or tingling - very minor. Worried about 2nd dose but do plan to get it.

At approximately 1:00 a.m. on 1/26/2021 I started waking up a lot and couldn&#39;t get comfortable.  I tossed and turned and body aches began and quickly worsened.  My knees, thigh bones, hips, pelvis, lower back, and shoulders all hurt like I had been beaten with a bat.  I took a sick day from work due to the severity of symptoms.  I had no fever, but did have hot flashes periodically throughout the day.  I was dizzy upon standing, had nasal congestion, and sever fatigue, and developed a moderately bad headache later that day.  I went to sleep at 10:30 p.m. on 1/26/2021 and slept through the night.  Upon waking on 1/27/2021, I felt much better.  I still have some lingering fatigue and stiffness but not enough to interfere with my normal routine.  I was vaccinated in my left arm and today, 1/27/2021 I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit that are quite sore.

                                                After the initial dose of Benadryl wore off, my skin began to itch, as well as my throat and ears. My arm also swelled up to the size of a softball where the injection was. I developed some bumps on my body, but was not covered in a rash. I had no problems breathing. I was itchy all day Sunday and my arm seemed to go down a little, but on Monday, when I went to work and couldn&#39;t take the allergy meds, it swelled again to nearly the size of a baseball. I think I might be allergic to the acetic acid in it because that&#39;s part of the compound in Aspirin, but I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s Tuesday and I still feel yucky, my arm is still itchy and it&#39;s still feverish and swollen and red at the injection site. Please call me and let me know if I should take the second dose. My husband has heart failure and I am a teacher. I want to protect him, but I worry that I had that kind of reaction even after taking allergy medication just in case beforehand.

                                                I got the vacine today.  Unfortunately I did have a reaction, and had to cancel my patient load at work for the day.  They said if you have food allergies you might have one, but I was willing to risk it.  They observed me for 30 min after.  After 15 min it felt like I was having a mild panick attack, but I?m used to that so I just breathed through it.  Coughed a few times.  After 30 min got up and was whoozy/dizzy, but shrugged it off, got my card and walked slowly to my car, drove 5 min home.  By then my hands were shaking hard.  It was like being shot with a crapload of adrenaline.  I called my sister and when I talked I started sobbing.  I don?t know, I just couldn?t stop.  But I knew it was just the adrenaline and if I could calm down, I?d get thru it.  She was awesome bc she kept her voice soft and low when she spoke, which helps.  After 3 hours it has calmed down and I?m just really cold and exhausted and nauseous and only a little shaky.  Being quiet and calm is helping.  Also sitting on a heating pad bc it?s 74 in my apartment and I?m freezing cold.  I?ll be ok by end of day.  I got the Moderna vacine and I?m still glad I did and thankful I could get it....but to those who are getting it...symptoms are that it feels like being shot full of adrenaline, you get a panic attack, but my O2 actually went up, not down.  Chest pain, panting, high anxiety, shaking, nausea, dizziness.

                                                Upon waking the next day I suddenly felt very ill, I was short of breath, had chills and was too weak to care for myself.  I had been diagnosed with COVID in June and was very ill with that.  This felt exactly like I did when I had COVID.   Throughout the day I ran a fever around 102.  My ability to think or care for myself was greatly impaired.  I continue to fight fatigue and brain fog.  I then developed several cold sores outside and in my mouth.  I continue to battle fatigue and weakness but am improving and now back to work.  I do not plan to get a second dose as I am afraid of a stronger reaction that would require emergency care.

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/30/2020. My arm was sore the day of and sore and slightly swollen the day after. I took Aleve (2 tab q 12 hrs) on 12/31. My arm was slightly swollen on 01/01/2021. I didn?t notice anything else until 01/07/2021. On that day I noticed the area around injection site to be hard and swollen. My arm was also red/warm/itchy half way down before elbow. I took Aleve as before for 2 more days. On 01/10 I went to urgent care since redness spread to above the elbow. Blood work was done. I was given Augmentin 875 (1 tab q 12 hrs x 10 days) and hydroxyzine 50 (1 TID). Currently on 01/13 a majority of redness above elbow is diminished and hardness around injection site and warmth is gone. Redness is now at elbow and under (traveling). I still have 7 days of abx and 3 days of antihistamine.

                                                Received the first injection of Moderna on 12/23/20. On 12/30/20 started with a red itchy rash that was warm to the touch. Went to urgent care that evening and was diagnosed with cellulitis and given a prescription for Keflex. Went back to urgent care on 12/31/20 because the cellulitis had spread and for an allergic reaction to the Keflex. The provider I saw the second time did not change the antibiotic because she felt it hadn&#39;t had enough of a dose. Went back again on 01/01/21 due to the rash was still spreading. The provider saw changed the antibiotic and said patient had a mixed medication reaction to the Keflex. The cellulitis has since cleared up.

When I saw it this morning,  it was about 2 cm in diameter, raised, hard,  erythematous area on Right upper deltoid. I marked it with ink. When I looked at it this afternoon, the area at the superior area of right deltoid appeared about the same but there was a trail of erythema going down her arm. She stated her elbow was now hurting and it felt like her elbow was swollen. I instructed her to see her PCP immediately as I felt she needed an antibiotic for what appeared to be cellulitis.

                                                I am an RN and was working a Covid 19 vaccine clinic for first responders. I took my own 1st administration of Moderna at approx 6:20 then went out to vaccinate/data entry. I noticed I was a little bit shaky and more jittery than normal but I attributed that to getting first vaccination clinic off the ground and problems we were having with computers and login. When I was leaving approx 2 hours later and all settled down I went to my car and noticed small area near front of tongue in R side. I also had small feelings of tingling or what felt like small electric current around edges of my tongue. My throat was sore but I had thought that was from talking to so many vaccinated first responders and having to talk over my n95 mask.  Upon getting home approx 12 minutes later I noticed my tongue had swollen. I was not having trouble breathing. Throat was red but no swelling noted. I took my Zyrtec early and then. 50 mg of Benadryl and it was relieved within 40 minutes. I did not need to seek any medical care and over the counter meds remedied the issue.

The patient&#39;s medical history included migraines and a hysterectomy. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included sumatriptan, naratriptan hydrochloride, and galconezumab.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A) in the left deltoid intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   A pharmacist called stating she received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 02 Jan 2021 at 9:45am in her left deltoid. Immediately after receiving the vaccine, she had facial flushing, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion and choking in the throat that lasted 20 minutes. After a few hours, she stated confusion would come and go, and she had no emotions. The next morning, the confusion was gone. On 03 Jan 2021, she reported having body aches and a fever of 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. She reported chills, body aches, and a lot of pain in the left arm. If she tried to move her left arm, the entire muscle in the left arm hurt.  Treatment for the events included acetaminophen and an antihistamine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was withdrawn.   The events, choking, flushing, vision blurred, were considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events, confusional state, emotional disorder, and dizziness, were considered resolved on 03 Jan 2021. The events, body aches, pyrexia, chills, and limb discomfort, were not considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 48 year old female patient with medical history of migraines, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Choking, non-serious unexpected events of Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, Confusional state, Emotional disorder, Pain, and Limb discomfort, and non-serious expected events of Pyrexia and Chills. The events of Choking, Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, and Confusional state occurred immediately after administration of their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A). The event of Emotional disorder occurred on the same day when the patient received mRNA-1273. The events of Pain, Pyrexia, Chills, and Limb discomfort occurred on the next day of mRNA-1273 administration. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This may be a duplicate report, as primary care notes state the process has been initiated. However, out of an abundance of caution, and as the facility the event was reported to, I wanted to enter this report for completeness due to the unusual events. Patient received 1st dose of moderna covid vaccine at an outside facility and (per patient) had a seizure at that site immediately following the injection (history of seizures due to past meningitis, no seizures in past 3 months per patient). No medications were given, 911 was not called, patient not instructed to go to ED (per patient). Patient went home. Once home, patient reported &#34;stroke like symptoms&#34; on her right side (weakness and inability to close right eye for 30 minutes, numbness in R thigh and heel). Then weakness moved to left side (numbness/tingling in L hand and eye, numbness in L lower leg) along with some swelling to face/tongue. Had back pain but no chest pain or difficulty breathing.  Extreme dizziness. No additional seizures. The next day she called our nursing line to report these symptoms and was instructed to go to the ED and also scheduled a visit with primary care provider the next morning. Patient stated she was feeling better and apparently did not go to the ED, instead choosing to see PCP next morning. On presentation to PCP, injection site was red and swollen, itching and swelling in hands, itching in bottom of feet, widespread joint pain. No visible rash, no dysphagia, no difficulty breathing. Other symptoms had largely resolved. Patient was prescribed benadryl (no steroids due to allergy to prednisone), cold compresses for injection site and sent home with instructions to go to ED if symptoms reappeared. Also recommended making an appointment with a neurologist for additional follow up as patient currently does not see a neurologist for seizures and is treating with CBD/THC only.

                                                I had typical reactions after vaccine for 3 days (chills, foggy/on and off again headache, extreme lethargy,  aches from arm to shoulders to other arm, sleeplessness (insomnia) for 2 days, soreness in injection site). No fever.  My concern is today is TEN days after vaccine injection and my injection site has a round redness and hardness at the injection site. About 1 inch in diameter. It&#39;s itchy off and on but no pain. It&#39;s hard, red, round, and the skin of it is raised similar to like a hive. I don&#39;t know if this is normal.  Especially because it&#39;s 10 days out from initial injection. I&#39;m due back for 2nd injection on Feb 9th.

I went back to bed and was restless and still had the same pain, so I took 975mg Tylenol. I continued to feel poorly and pain was increasing, so I used Maxalt x 2 without any relief.  I became nauseated and diaphoretic with increasing pain in my head.  I woke my husband to take me to the ER for relief.  My pain was 8 and all vital signs normal.  1 liter of Saline, Toradol 30mg IV and Zofran got the headache to a 3. I did follow up with my doctor later that day for further eval.  I have not had a headache that bad in 17 years.

                                                7 days after  vaccine administration, my right shoulder began itching and several large red welts appeared. I took Benadryl before bed and that alleviated some itching. The following morning I had a 4 inch by 6 inch area of redness like a sunburn on my shoulder. The skin is hot. My husband who is a physician described the area as indurated. I was able to go to work. I used ice packs for the itching because Benadryl is sedating. Friday evening the shoulder continued to be red and indurated and hot. Saturday AM the shoulder has a center area of white with decreased sensation of hardness. There is a dull ache and the skin is hot.

Cold continued yet was covered in sweat. By about 30 hours after vaccine had terrible headache, chills, sweating, and still body aches. Woke up next morning still with the same symptoms. As the day went on side effects started to subside except the headache and now had no appetite. Still three days after vaccine was taking ibuprofen for headache. By fourth day all symptoms were gone.

Prior to the seizure they said that she was &#34;feeling off&#34;, &#34;jittery&#34;, and &#34;misfiring&#34;.  The RN that notified me said that they were checking on her every hour and the last check in was at 1:00 PM. She went to check on her at 2:00 PM when she found her in the hallway very pale/gray, bradycardic, and hypotensive. The nurse said she appeared to be postictal and hallucinating. They immediately called 911 -and she was transferred to the hospital and to my knowledge she is still there. RN will keep me updated.

                                                Yesterday, 1/28/20, Eight days after receiving injection, my arm presented swelling, itching, and burning sensation.  Today, 1/29/20, was not better and rash developed on my abdomen.  Went to clinic.. She said it was my body reacting to the vaccination.  I did not have any unusual side effects other than a sore arm for 2 days post injection. Just showed up 8 days later.  Doctor suggested I report to CDC for data reasons.  She prescribed Claritin 2 X per day, and Prednisone if needed for pain.  Did not feel this should deter me from getting second dose on 02/18/2020.

                                                Patient was advised to sit for 15 minutes after the vaccination. The first time around patient did not have any allergic reaction to the vaccination. The patient was aware that there was still a potential of an reaction to the vaccination  the second time. The patient sat in the same room vaccinations were being given after her vaccination. She felt a little stuffy so she asked if you could sit outside right by the door. When she went to sit outside in 2 minutes she started to cough and her airways became constricted along with her hands, face and tongue started to swell. Instantly we rushed to her with an Epi Pen but the patient had her own which she took out and used. We laid her on the floor putting a pillow beneath her head while raising her legs up in the air. The facility dialed 911 along with providing an oxygen mask. One minute after the Epi Pen the patient started to feel better then help arrived 5 minutes later to which she felt her airways constricting again. After the emergency help took her to the ER she came back in 3 hours and said she felt fine and the ER had released her.

                                                I received the vaccine on February 6th.  My arm was sore for about 5 days.  The soreness went away.  On February 16th, I noticed a red itchy spot where I had the vaccine.  On the 17th, the red itchy spot grew larger.  It was slightly swollen, red, warm to touch, and pinkish.  I did a video conference with a doctor.  She said it could be a delayed reaction to the vaccine or cellulitis.  I was prescribed CLEOCIN (Take 3 capsules by mouth three times a day for 7 days).  It continued to swell and spread on 18th and 19th.  I saw another doctor on the 19th.  She prescribed  predniSONE for three days and  BACTRIM DS for 10 days.  She mentioned it could be a reaction to the vaccine or cellulitis.    I am concerned about getting the 2nd vaccine on March 6th.  I won&#39;t be done with the meds until March 1st.  As of Monday, February 22nd, the spot is not longer swollen.  It is slightly pink and much smaller.

                                                Presented with Shingles on Jan 11/2021. Had a rash on the ribs. Right side, burning sensation on the rib area, both sides and the feeling that my clothes were made of sand paper. I was prescribed acyclovir tablets. 1g every 8 hours for a week.  After that shingles progressed and over the next week I developed more discomfort at wearing clothes, the rash moved to my back. I also had numbing sensation in the area and the feeling of warm tickling worms crawling over the area. Finally I started experiencing a lot of pain in the area. All of this caused me to miss about a week and a half of work. I was given gabapentin for the pain, but it messed with my equilibrium a lot so now I am taking lírica 150mg every 8 hours. The rash is almost gone as are most of the other symptoms except for the pain and occasional discomfort to clothes. I am also on lidocaine cream to help that.

                                                The day of the injection, approx. 3-4 minutes after getting the injection, I almost passed out.  I became hot, sweaty, dizzy and my head starting to buzz.  The nurse on-site provided me a couple cold packs and after about 30 minutes, I felt better. The nurse described my response as a &#34;vascular&#34; reaction.  Later that night, I got a headache and night sweats and bouts of nausea.  They only lasted a day.    Approx. 10 days after the injection,  the injection site became red, swollen, itchy and uncomfortable to the touch. Then it traveled down my arm and created a large red, swollen, itchy area on my entire upper arm.   I advised my doctor and she provided me a Rx for a topical steroid and oral steroid.    After 5 days of treatment, it is 90% better.   The injection site still hurts.

                                                Patient is hospital employee who completed screening form for COVID-19 vaccine by answering &#34;no&#34; to all contraindication questions.   Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

My hands were sweating and I felt a menthol like smell that traveled down my throat. After about 5-10 minutes a headache started which lasted throughout the evening. I took a benadryl about 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine and the symptoms started to improve. No swelling, difficulty breathing or rashes noted.

                                                moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Tachycardia sudden onset 4 minutes after injection (6:09am). Arms and legs cold and weak. Generalized weakness. BP 167/78, o2 sats 100%. Tachycardia lasted about 10-15minutes and resolved to HR 88 and BP 138/78.  Still left with overall weakness, malaise, cold feeling. No other symptoms.  Released from the facility at 6:48am.  Drove 2 blocks to my husband&#39;s workplace (hospital). Had diarrhea x 2, dull diffuse headache, odd feeling and malaise that persisted. Sudden onset of terrible feeling, the need to get to the ER at 8:36am. Had a bathroom visit to urinate. By the time we got to the ER the intense malaise improved. I sat in the ER lobby not wanting to be admitted to the ER (didn&#39;t want to be having a vaccine reaction). I stayed in the ER lobby. Symptoms completely resolved at 9:45am. I stayed there for 30 more minutes to be sure and then drove home with no other symptoms but Left arm soreness. Tachycardia never returned after the first episode. No rash, no itching, no swelling, no dyspnea. Just felt toxic. Then it resolved completely at hour 4.

                                                After 5 minutes of having the vaccine I experienced right sided tongue tingling followed by a funny taste. 5 minutes after that my arm started itching from the injection site. I took ibuprofen pm that had Benadryl in it to help. I was fine all night after taking the ibuprofen with Benadryl. This morning 1/7/21, I have a sour metallic taste which has not resolved.

I felt a lot of pressure behind my nose, but not a stuffy nose. The woozy feeling also brought on some nausea. I felt like I couldn&#39;t focus, like I was in a daze or fog. This lasted throughout the following day. Left arm at sight of injection was sore starting 2 hours after shot, couldn&#39;t raise left arm x2 days. Still sore but manageable. I took a zofran for the nausea.

My nose became immediately and intensely congested to the point there was pressure, I felt heated and as I communicated that I may be having a reaction my throat started to swell. Then it suddenly released. A heat ban moved down my body to my abdomen.  I waited for about 20-25 minutes and felt fine. Then about 45 minutes later, I experienced tingling in my lips and very mild congestion. The tingling and mild congestion would perhaps come on and subside with less intensity over the next hour.  Very mild congestion continued on and off until the next afternoon.

Arm soreness developed about 8 hours after vaccine, woke next morning with fever 100.9, severe body aches, headache, nausea, weakness and fatigue, decreased appetite. In addition, as the  day went on I experienced a shallow cough, high pulse rate (130), tongue twitching and just felt aweful. Slept on and off all day, sx lasted the entire day. Took Tylenol throughout the day for the the fever. I awoke 3:30 am today, 1/10/21 with fever 101.5, took more Tylenol, still headache and feel tongue twitchiness  however muscle aches, body aches, nausea, decreased appetite and fatigue have subsided. I took 600mg Advil around 9am today and have been gradually feeling much better as of now 1:30pm. As a side note, I did have COVID 19 illness mildly in March 2020. It was dx&#39;d with PCR testing and my sx were loss of taste/smell, nausea, weight loss, bursted eye vessel, slight respiratory sx, I recovered well and had a follow up negative test 2 weeks after.

These symptoms are similar to the symptoms she had in the past after exposure to shellfish. The patient received 1 dose of epinephrine and 1 dose of diphenhydramine with improvement in symptoms. The patient subsequently went home, had recurrent symptoms, and went to a local emergency department for additional treatment. In the emergency department, she received steroids and anithistamines and symptoms resolved.

Continued to feel weird rubbing chest and short of breath but no chest pain.  Decided to take her to the ED.  On the way she passed out and was not responsive still had a pulse.  In ED became responsive, reports numbness in both arms and short of breath.   Received Benadryl complete assessment, doesn&#39;t appear to be an acute allergic reaction.  ECG &amp; vitals were okay. Patient observed for 4 hours and seemed to improve so discharged.

                                                Got the injection 1/4/2021 in R deltoid at 1:50pm. Was fine that day, just had a temp of 99.8-99.9 degrees F that evening, but no symptoms. 1/5/2021 just had a sore right arm when raising it above 100 degrees flexion, and tenderness when touched. Everything else was fine. No other symptoms. Suddenly on 1/9/2021 I felt a burning sensation in my right armpit (anterior) and it lasted all day and I feared maybe the shingles was coming back (I had it back in August 2020), and Sunday 1/10/2021 still had the burning sensation in the armpit but it seemed to be getting less intense. Then on Monday 1/11/2021, the burning was gone, but when I went to take a shower, there was a significant lump in my right armpit where the burning was before. It was a bit tender to the touch but a pretty signifigant lump.  Upon inspecting the injection site on my right arm, I noticed that the bruise from the injection was still there, but now there was also a big red oval circle (almost the width of my arm), about an inch under the injection site that was not there before. I have called my doctor and have made an appointment to see him tomorrow morning at 11am.

                                                Patient is an Employee at the store.  She received the vaccine at approximately 11am on 1/9/2021.  She was watched for 15 minutes, with no adverse problems.  She left the Facility at approximately12:30p, but returned around 3:15pm, to say she wanted to talk with me before I left.  She stated her face was swollen, very puffy, and she was getting a rash.  She had no other problems at that time and otherwise felt ok. She hadn&#39;t eaten or done anything differently during the day.  I offered patient a dose of Benadryl, however she stated she could not take Benadryl.  I told her to pick up some Zyrtec and take that, and see how she felt.  I called patient at 6:35pm to check on her and she stated that the swelling had gone down and that she felt fine.

I received the vaccine from the treatment facility.  I developed and itchy, red circular non-elevated, non-pustular rash near the injection site. It was very, slightly tender and swollen. My injection was bruised so I knew where it was. That pain from the injection and bruise diminished in 3 days post-injection. The rash developed next to the injection site. It started on day 7 after the administration and faded in about 36 hours. No other allergic-type reaction.

                                                About 5mins after she received the vaccine she had a flushed sensation over whole body followed by dizziness and then trouble swallowing.  Approximately 2hrs after vaccine the reaction subsided but then developed a rash over whole body.  The rash lasted until late evening and then started to subside.  She took  Zyrtec and Motrin by that point.  She has an immunologist involved in the care of her asthma. He recommended she carry an EPI PEN.  We do not recommend she proceed with the second vaccine.

Next day, I went back to the site in my workplace where I got the vaccine, they said it looks like cellulitis and to go directly to the doctor. Doctor prescribed antibiotics. The redness became bigger even if I am already taking antibiotics although swelling subsided, but it is still itchy.  There is also a throbbing pain near my elbow. My Primary Care Doctor confirmed that it is cellulitis.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine, I awoke at 4am to severe pain, swelling, and stiffness at the injection site.  By 7am I was feeling nauseous, lightheaded and my arm was very stiff, itchy and swollen at the injection site.  I took Zyrtec D thinking that this was a delayed allergic response to the vaccine.  By 10am the symptoms were worsening and my lymph nodes in my left underarm and in my neck were swollen.  I called my physician who had me add another dose of Zyrtec and Motrin.  These symptoms worsened over the course of the day including tingling in my left arm and hand, numbness in my arm and hand until approximately 730pm when I was finally able to eat something and keep it down.  I went to bed exhausted, still with stiff upper arm and feeling general malaise.  I awoke this morning (1/20/21) at 6:45am and my arm is still stiff and swollen.  Other symptoms are resolving and I have been able to eat.

                                                About an hour after I received the Moderna vaccine, the left side of the face felt warm and being to tingle.  My left ear, my left cheek and my lower lip to the midline felt like pins and needles.  It began to get more numb and I had a lot of difficulty eating my lunch because I started to bite my lip because it was so numb.  I then took 50 mg of Benedryl in  Tablet form.  Within 45minutes the numbness dissipated and has not returned.  I have no weakness or drooping.  The numbness has not returned.  My left arm was really sore for 3 days but is no longer painful.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.   On, 10 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 037K2DA). On 04 Feb 2021, a day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 015M20A) for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.   On 05 Feb 2021, the patient&#39;s left arm was swollen and hurt. Around 6:00 a.m., she put her hand on her scalp, and she felt a bump. After 15 minutes, she touched the bump again and it was getting bigger and itchy. Beside that bump there was another bump, so she took diphenhydramine. At 9:30, she felt the bumps were spreading on her scalp. Then the patient saw that she had real hives on her arm. Thirty minutes later, she noticed her legs had a lot of hives too. A nurse told her it was an allergic reaction. She stated she knew herself and had never had an allergic reaction like this.

                                                I noticed a slight red circular ring about the 4th day (February 14, 2021) but it was so slight, i couldn&#39;t tell if it really was a ring or not.  I didn&#39;t really pay attention or notice it was &#34;blotchy&#34; and &#34;red&#34; with some small red areas feeling slightly warm to the touch until February 19, 2021.   I took a picture of my arm on February 20, 2021 for documentation purposes.  Today, February 21, 2021,  the red blotchy patches/uneven circle looks lighter in color.   I had a headache on February 18 and 19, however, I can&#39;t positively say it was from the COVID vaccine.

                                                Very soon after receiving the shot, my throat began to feel tight and I told my husband it felt funny.  Within about 45 minutes, it hurt swallow, more than any sore throat I have ever had.  It wasn&#39;t like a dry, scratchy sore throat, it was almost like ti was on the outside of my throat.  Had the clinic that gave me the shot kept me for monitoring, they would have been able to catch this reaction but they didn&#39;t.  When I called them they told me it could be 24 hours before I would get a call back so I went to the ER because I was afraid I was having an allergic reaction of some type.  The ER monitored me for 3 hours and then released me.  About 12 hours later, the pain in my throat and when swallowing began to subside.

I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

                                                AT 5pm the same day, felt a little fatigued and slight headache. The next morning 12-30-20 at 730, was so fatigued, couldn&#39;t hardly stand. Felt like when I had mono. Had headache, back and neck aches, fever of 100.2. Felt like glands were swollen. After 4 hours, symptoms began to subside, but still mildly present. Fever subsided and was gone from 11AM on. Injection site pain still present with redness. Skin felt very sensitive on the arms Today, 12-31, felt good, no fever, slightly tired, but good enough to work. Came to work and when in the process of writing this RL, I was reviewing the side effects and looked at my injection site. It looked red so I asked a coworker, who thought it looked like hives. We had our medical director and PA look at it and although they didn&#39;t feel like it looked like hives, I developed hives on my chest, neck and chin while they were in here. Called employee health who recommended either PCP or urgent care. Went to urgent care. During visit, hives began to subside, had 99.6 fever at the beginning of the visit, 98.7 at the end of the visit. Rapid COVID test was negative. Received inhaler for asthma and returned to work at 1245 today.

They sat me down and about couple minutes later I felt my heart rate racing and felt flushed.  I reported how I felt the the staff and they put me in a recliner.  The rapid heart rate went away about a minute later.  I stayed at the vaccine clinic for total of 35 minutes after the shot.  They made sure I felt o.k. before I left.  I didn&#39;t have that feeling again.  I felt fine the rest of the day and today.  I have had that same feeling before not from vaccine.  I have never had reaction to vaccine or medications.   2 years ago I thought I was allergic to avocado or avocado oil because I had a couple of incidence of having that same dizzy fast heart rate feeling after avocado oil.  I went to an allergist and got tested and was negative for avocado and he also tested me for shell fish because I have had history of being itchy after eating shellfish.  I was negative for both.  I haven&#39;t had that same reaction for several years since that incident.  I have been able to eat avocado and shellfish without problem.  I don&#39;t really know if this is an allergic reaction or an immune response to the vaccine.  I am going to see my allergist on 1/6/21 see what he thinks.  I am wondering if I should get the second dose.

I circled it and then 1/4/21 at 6am noticed the redness and swelling and hardness had increased by an inch.  I contacted my doctor who diagnosed cellulitis and ordered oral antibiotics for 10 days

                                                On the way home I developed upper lip swelling followed by some right cheek swelling. At this point, I got really concerned ( maybe overly) but I pulled into a parking lot and called 911. I never had difficulty breathing and I had  a normal pulse oximetry. The fire department stayed with me for a while and it did not worsen, so I declined the ambulance ride and headed home.  The swelling lasted about 3 hours and resolved in reverse direction ( lip first, followed by the cheek)

                                                Presented in ED with a reddened and swollen area of her  left deltoid region..  The patient states that she received the Madrona vaccine on 21 December in the left deltoid.  She states that she had no problem with the vaccine initially.  She states that she even hiked this last weekend and felt fine.  She states that she developed a reddened area of the skin 3 days ago that has been increasing in size.  It is now tender and somewhat warm to the touch.  She states that she also felt  some itchiness of her upper chest.  She is not sure if she has any true hives in this area.  She denies facial, tongue, or lip swelling.  She denies difficulty breathing.  She denies chest pain.  She denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.  ASSESMENT and PLAN   Erythematous, hive-like region of the left deltoid that began 12 days after the Moderna vaccine.  This is likely a localized delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction.  Bedside ultrasound performed by myself.  I do not note any pocket of fluid to indicate an abscess.  However, there is a small possibility that this could be cellulitis.  A cellulitis would be much more concerning.  From an allergic perspective, she has no evidence of anaphylaxis based on the timeframe and her current symptoms.  As a result, she will continue on Benadryl for now at 50 mg every 6 hours and will be placed on doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 10 days.  May use prednisone taper but she should wait for 48 hours.  If she has improvement with doxycycline and Benadryl, she should continue with this.  The Benadryl is truly as needed and if it is improving, she does not need to continue on it.  She will.

I called my doctor and they want me to go to urgent care this morning. She told me that 100% of healthcare workers are seeing the same thing 7-10 days after the Moderna vaccination.  My lymph node (armpit where vaccination was administered) is swollen and painful, neck hurts, and have a very low fever.  The vaccination site is swollen, warm, hard and has a red circle below injection site that was the size of a nickel day 1 but now it takes up my entire deltoid region&#34;.

Day 8 - on 01/06/21 - fingers, hands, and feet incredibly sore.  Painful to do anything with fingers - staple, put on earrings, grip anything, etc.  Feet hurt to walk.  Joints in fingers swollen - can&#39;t wear rings.    NP is my primary care - but she didn&#39;t administer the vaccine.  Vaccine was done at Facility - offered and administered  by the pharmacist.

                                                I started to have mild symptoms (malaise, flush feeling and then numb, tingling, weak hands followed by joint pain) in the afternoon of 1/7. The symptoms progressively worsened into what my husband (an immunologist) called an intense hyperimmune response. I had severe COVID symptoms (intensified from my experience having the virus in Sept): fever 100-102, flushed face, intense muscular and some neurologic symptoms--joint arthralgia and myalgia, headache, shivers/rigors, extreme weakness (especially my hands) and later I could barely stand or walk, glandular pain with minor swelling (axillary and neck), nausea, and my hearing was temporarily diminished--nearly lost for a few minutes; tylenol 500 mg taken the night of 1/7. The intense symptoms have subsided. Currently I am tired, weak, achy, and afebrile (last ibuprofen 200 mg taken last night). My hands remain weak.

I felt like flu like symptoms for the next few days. I was in bed Friday, Saturday, and Sunday i went to ER due to throat, face and neck swelling. It was hard for me to swallow. They gave me an IV and administered Benadryl and something to help with my throat. In about 30 minutes i could swallow much better. I still feel tired and just have no energy at all. I went to see my doctor and i will not be getting the second dose of the moderna shot.

I waited 30 min from vaccine time to make sure I was going to be ok. At 5:30 pm on 1/6/21 I noticed I stared itching my right arm around the inside of the elbow. I noticed my vision blurring and I had a sudden onset of a Horrific headache. By 6 pm I was itching very severely. It was as if I was clawing at my skin. I called one of the dr&#39;s I  work with and he called me in a medrol dose pack. I started the dose pack at 8:30 pm on the 6th. The headache continued, I tried motrin, fiorcet, and oxycodone with no relief. I still have the headache but it is not as intense as it was. I was up all night itching and dealing with the headache by the am , my jaw was  visibly swollen and it felt like I had been in a fight. I was not able to go to work on 1/7/21 and could only work 1/2 day on 1/8/21. the itching did not subside much till sat 1/9 but is coming back as I  taper down off the steroids. My last pill was this am. The jaw pain and swelling lasted till sat night and is subsiding daily. I may have to call my pcp and be seen this week.

She developed a rash over her trunk and extremities that was warm and pruritic. She was given 50mg po benadryl before I evaluated her. When I saw her she was not in extremis, respiratory distress or with audible stridor, but did appear uncomfortable. She denied any lip swelling, tongue swelling or throat closure, however did note that her heart was racing and she was having chest heaviness. The patient&#39;s lungs were clear and there was no audible wheezing or signs of cyanosis. Pulse ox was 100-110 HR, with O2 sat 97-100%.  Did not appear to be an anaphylactic reaction at this time.  She was brought to the ER for further observation

                                                I felt fine immediately after and the days following.  I had slight soreness in my arm but nothing terrible until a week later. I woke up with my arm red and swollen and hot to the touch. It got worse over the next two days. The swelling started to become hard and started traveling down my arm almost to my elbow.  At this point, I was becoming more concerned because of adverse reactions similar to mine. On 1/21/21 I made an appointment to video conference with a doctor. This doctor recommended I take Benadryl and ice my arm. I was informed if it got worse, I should contact my PCP or go to an urgent care. I did ice my arm several times a day, applied a topical Benadryl and I took Benadryl before going to bed. Today, 1/22/21, I can see a lot of improvement.

(total of 20lbs). A few days after getting 1st dose the hot flashes have been relentless; Internal hot flashes literally every 5-10m, daily, consistently throughout the day, even as I fill out this report. Not sure if the dose has anything to do with this starting up again, but I wanted to report it just in case some others report it.  I do not take anything for the flashes. I just seek some form of air conditioning such as a fan. However, the flashes are very annoying as I even get them while sleeping and it interrupts my rest. No sweating though.

I took a &#34;Claritin&#34; at 5 pm on Thursday, January 28, 2021 but the swelling continued. By noon on Friday, January 29, 2021, the two small flea bit size bumps have merged into a large bump the size of a quarter. The redness around the bump is gone but the bump is red and itchy.

Wednesday evening I started to feel a low grade fever again along with the body aches and chills.  Thursday my arm had a larger red swollen area, hot to touch and very tender as the day progressed I felt very fatigued and went to bed early.  This morning, my arm is still tender(not as tender as yesterday) but still red and swollen.

The next day I had fever, chills, nausea and it just continued. Yesterday morning I had my husband take me to ER and I had lost 15 pounds since Wednesday. I couldn&#39;t keep down fluids. They tested me for Corona and the flu but both were negative. They also gave me fluids. Everything and smells and tastes terrible. They gave me Zofran but it didn&#39;t help. I haven&#39;t been able to take my medicine.

                                                I received injection at 1332 in L arm. Within 5 minutes I began to feel tingling in the left side of my neck and the tip of my tongue was numb. I waited about 5 min to see if sx would diminish and notified clinic staff at 1344. Physician and nurse immediately responded to assess. At 1350 I looked in mirror and neck was red from L side of neck to center. As physician was again assessing symptoms we both watched the redness spread to the right side of my neck. By this time my lips were also numb and I began feeling mild full body tingling. Physician and I entered clinic and I received epi-pen injection at 1404.  The redness in neck resolved within a few minutes and the total body tingling also resolved. Nurse noted mild swelling around upper lip but it also quickly resolved after receiving epi-pen injection. EMS were called. I was evaluated by EMS and deemed stable. I had 2 epi-pens in my possession as well as Vistaril and an inhaler so I declined being treated at emergency room I left clinic at 1430. On my drive home, I noted that area above upper lip and nose were numb. I also began experiencing numbness of soft palate of roof of mouth. I arrived home shortly before 1500 and took a Pepcid and a dose of Vistaril. I reported reaction to the health department and Moderna on 3/9/21. I was evaluated by my personal physician on 3/9/21.  I continue to have numbness on tip of tongue and lips 3/10./21. Per Moderna personnel, they were unable to tell me how long to expect symptoms to last and I continue to treat with antihistamines and monitor.

I took 400 MG of Advil. Rash was not there at that time. Went back to bed and woke up around 730-740 AM  and noted the rash to my stomach. I took 1 Benadryl at that time, then itching got worse and took another Benadryl. Currently rash continues to be red and raised and the body aches/headache remain the same.  Placed call to medical clinic and left a message.

                                                Reports that several hours after receiving the vaccine, she noticed her lower lip was tingling and felt full. Over the next 24-48 hours she developed painful oral lesions on the inner and outer surface of her lower lip. These were fixed lesions; some eroded and crusted over.  Presented to primary care clinic on 31DEC2020 and was diagnosed with HSV. She was prescribed a course of PO valacyclovir and topical acyclovir ointment. All lesions are now fully resolved; however, she reports resulting tingling sensation.  Reports she was feeling well on 12/28 and in the days leading up to the vaccine. No known sick contacts. Denies any previous history of HSV lesions. Reports history of acute Varicella infection in her early 20&#39;s.   Suspect this was a reactivation of HSV or VZV triggered by vaccination.

It started to expand from the marks, so went to urgent care 1/8/21.  The doctor stated that I was having a local allergic reaction, also that they gave me the vaccination in the wrong spot on my arm.  I was told to keep watch on the red hot bump, take Benadryl if not improved then go back in the the doctor.  He took a picture to put in my chart to watch it. Did another line around the site to watch it 1/9/21 since it got bigger from when I went to the doctor.  It kept getting bigger so went back to the doctor today 1/10/21.  This doctor also stated that I was given the vaccination in the wrong spot on my arm.  Now I&#39;m on an antibiotic and a steroid.  I&#39;m to still watch it and if it doesn&#39;t improve I need to go back in.  She also took another pic to put into my chart to see the size difference.

                                                I received the shot at 8:10 am and felt nothing.  As the morning progressed, I developed a sore arm, similar to a flut shot.  However, it was worse, and I also felt achy in my neck.  I drove home from work around noon, and I couldn&#39;t even use my arm on the steering wheel.  These symptoms continued and I finally took Tylenol in the middle of the afternoon, and evening going to bed.  I slept horribly and woke up feeling like a train wreck.  I took my temperature. It was 102!  I started taking the Tylenol again.  I couldn&#39;t even raise my arm, either. My arm didn&#39;t hurt if it was just still, but it would hurt if it was touched, and I could not raise it for 3 days.  Despite taking the Tylenol, I felt awful all day and really had to stay bedridden.  I was also very thirsty both the day of the vaccine and this second day.  Saturday morning I woke up feeling better, but as the day wore on, the aches and fever came back.  Sunday was the same as Saturday.  Monday was similar, but better overall.  Today is Tuesday.   My arm still feels a little weird and I cannot completely raise it. I did have the COVID-19 back in March and have antibodies, as far as I know as I have donated to Red Cross 4 times.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving my injection on Thursday, I noticed my upper lip felt like it was swelling.  Over the next 30 minutes, I felt the same in my lower lip and cheeks.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl at that time.  I slept for nearly 20 hours after that.  On Friday, I experienced severe body aches from head to toe.  I felt somewhat better Saturday.  I woke up Sunday with nausea and dizziness that lasted all day and evening.  I woke up feeling better Monday morning but noticed 2 enlarged lymph nodes above my collar bone and pain from my R deltoid, across my shoulder and into my lower neck.  It is Tuesday and and the lymph nodes are painful to touch and I&#39;m experiencing 5/10 pain in my upper arm, shoulder R side and back of neck and above my R scapula.  I am considering calling my PCP.

                                                After 2 days I started having pain under my armpit but did not feel ill. I was answering the text messages and there was not anywhere to document what was going on because I felt fine.  I stopped getting the texts today so I couldn&#39;t talk with anyone about how swollen my lymph nodes under my arm is. I have not been able to get anyone on the phone to ask what to do.  It is a very strange coincidence that my nodes are swollen for the first time in my life and the only thing that is different is that I received the vaccination.

                                                I was feeling great until day 9 after the injection.  I could not sleep, was very warm and arm was sore.  I woke next morning to find my left arm at the injection site very swollen, hard, red, rashy, and extremely hot to the touch.  I advised with the nurses at work that morning, and I was told it was a common side affect, but I was still uneasy since I had no reaction until day 9.  I was prompted to call my doctor, which was out of the office, was advised to go to prompt care.  I was treated with a prescription of steriods and antibiotics.  Slept better that night, less hot, hard, rashy, and red next morning.  Still used ice packs during the work day.

                                                Almost a week after receiving the first vaccine with no major side effects other than a sore arm, I had a sudden itching/ rash develop on the same arm that quickly began to spread, itch, and become swollen and hot.  It was much further down from my original injection site. NO relief found from over the counter antihistamine medicine or topical medications. Went to Urgent Care the following evening because the redness had spread and nothing was working. Urgent Care stated it was a vaccination reaction and not cellulitis or staph infection and to continue to take antihistamine and return the next day if not better. Returned home and 12 hours later, the injection site became red and raised and itchy as well, no changes in color or reduction of size to the larger area that is red and hot and swollen.

Kept up and got more pronounced throughout week and started feeling burning sensations in both arms through Feb 15th. Self referred to Neurology on Feb. 16th.  Feb 17th, began to feel worse, spreading to both legs feeling weak, burning sensation, fatigue, and began feeling VERY foggy brained.  Have been sleeping a lot, but legs and arms go from burning sensations, weakness, to cold sensations, and achy right leg thigh muscle, to this moment.  Brain fog and fatigue seem worst in morning.

                                                The patient had gone shopping in the store after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and then returned to the pharmacy after about 10 minutes saying she wasn&#39;t feeling well. She reported feeling hot, that her lips were tingling, and stating she just felt weird. I had her sit in the immunization booth so I could tend to her without and audience. I gave her 10 ml of Benadryl because she mentioned her lips were tingling. I broke one of the instant icepacks for her and had her place it on the back of her neck and put her head between her knees. She reported feeling that her face felt hot, so I broke two more icepacks and had her sit up right and place the ice packs on the front of her neck. I stayed with her in the booth and talked to her until she felt better. I set the timer on my phone for 15 minutes. After 10 minutes she said she was feeling better and wanted to move to the waiting area. She was fine after the full 15 minutes and left our store. I estimate she remained in the store for approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

                                                She reports history of Moderna vaccination on Friday, March 5th.  It was her second dose.  She felt awful within an hour of vaccination and persisted with symptoms for 2.5 days.  She described it as being out of it, headache, fever, chills, profound body aches, weakness and dizziness with palpitations.  She could not get out of bed for a day.  She literally thought she was going to die given the severity of her weakness.  As quickly as the symptoms occurred, they left her on March 7th, 2021.  She went to work on March 8th and noted similar symptoms to prior ITP flares - petechiae on legs, gum bleeding, fatigue, mild headache.  She also noted dark urine but no frank blood.  Since being admitted and receiving steroids, she is feeling improved and petechiae are lessening.  She also noted mild mouth ulceration to lower lip along with oozing.

                                                Employee got COVID vaccine on 1/2/2021. She was awoken at 0400 AM that night with extreme chills, shivering. Fever 102.5 on Sunday, fatigue and body aches. Localized pain at injection site. Yesterday she felt better. Highest temp yesterday was 101.5. She noticed redness and swelling on Sunday and this morning she noticed it is larger-swelling and redness the size of a silver dollar that is hot to the touch. She is unsure of her temperature today and does not feel febrile today. She does not feel well today-feels body aches and general malaise. Her arm is painful, 5/10, and radiates up into shoulder and neck and causing a headache. Her right jaw was painful on Sunday and Monday. If she applied pressure to her jaw the pain would subside. Reports diarrhea Sunday into Monday that has since subsided. Employee reports being diagnosed with COVID on 11/15/2020.

                                                My first symptoms were expected-- sore arm and slightly tired feeling -- a few days later my shoulder itched where I got the shot. Then a week later, two things-- and one is PMS. Obviously not the shot but I mention this as it is possible that these side effects are related to the PMS. On Sunday 1/3/2021 I was experiencing breast tenderness PMS and that extended under my arms and by the end of that day my glands were swollen and hard in my right armpit. The next morning, they were still hard and swollen and the glands are still today. While I often have breast tenderness, I have never had swollen glands or painful underarms as part of this. Also yesterday 1/4 my right shoulder near where I received the vaccine was i was itchy and it continues to be and red and also hard there... I don&#39;t want to overplay any of these symptoms and they might well relate to PMS but I think in this instance particularly with the very painful swollen glands on the right underarm it&#39;s important to report them

Her right eye then started to swell around 2 pm and she began to have difficulty talking and swallowing. She was not short of breath but felt like her throat was tightening. She arrived to work at 2:50 pm and informed her boss who sent her to the employee health department. She reported having oral Benadryl and  was going to take that. Anesthesiology evaluated her, felt it was a progressive allergic reaction, and recommended evaluation at an urgent care or ED. She later developed hives, her lower lip became swollen.  She was later evaluated at Emergency Department. She will be able to provide you with information on the doctor, treatment. She was prescribed a course of prednisone and will have allergy testing scheduled. MD indicated uncertain if caused by vaccine.   She missed work on 1/6 due to the ongoing reaction which had improved.

Similar to vasovagal experience without nausea at that time.  Staff took me to nursing station, and I felt better within 10 minutes of laying down on ice pack, drinking water.  Stayed there for an hour and got  a ride home in case.  Blood pressure was very elevated afterwards for several hours.

I had dermal fillers placed on cheeks in early 2019.   Today swelling is almost gone.  Took antihistamines Claritin, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Spoke with a collegue regarding the reaction. I am wondering about my second dose and same kind of reaction.

                                                Following day (Wed) my right eye was irritated and became itchy later on.  Had Dr look at it and she started me on hot compresses with orders to start eye drops with antihistamine if this did not help.  Did hot compresses felt a bit better on Thurs.  Fri eyes were worse, started Eye drops.  Saturday ears were itchy and sore with drainage--thought infected.  Sunday both eyes were red, itchy oozing,, ears still oozing and sore--went to Urgent care.  They said no ear infection and started me on Eye drops with steroids but could not get them until Monday around 5pm.  Corners of mouth started cracking open as well.  Monday started steroid drops. Wednesday eyes were much worse and felt like glass in them.  called Dr.  She said to stop steroid drops and go back to antihistamine drops and start Claritin.  Started immediately and I started putting Ivarest in my ears. Eyes have stopped oozing but are still red.  Ears are clearing up and not as sore.  Mouth is starting to clear up

                                                Had minimal pain at injection site on night of vaccine 12/30/20 and the next day 12/31/20 with no redness or swelling at the site. On 1/1/21 the pain had gone and still had no redness or swelling at the site. Then on 1/7/21 around 1400 I noticed it was itching at the injection site and there was a 1cm area of redness and induration. By 2100 on 1/7/21 the redness and induration had grown to 5-6cm and area was warm. On 1/8/21 by 1500 the redness and induration had grown to 8cm and redness starting to go down the arm. At 1900 the area is still about 8cm and now left axillary lymphadenopathy has developed. I am a NP and am watching it, I will seek treatment tomorrow if no improvement or if it worsens.

Temperature highs ranged from 100.8-101.4, and I felt as badly as when I had COVID-19 in March 2020. I was unable to go to work as scheduled on Friday 1/8 and Saturday 1/9. I am concerned about getting the 2ND DOSE as it has been stated that 2nd dose may create more severe symptoms than the first. PLEASE ADVISE. Also, is there a correlation between having had COVID-19 and having strong &#34;side effects&#34; to the vaccine? Please advise. Thank you!

                                                Throat tightness; not feeling well; Upper chest pressure; A spontaneous report was received from a pharmacist concerning a 52-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced throat tightness, upper chest pressure and was not feeling well.  The patient did not have any relevant medical history. The patient denied any previous history of adverse reactions to vaccines. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Dec 2020 at 09:40 am, approximately five minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 9:45 am, the patient experienced throat tightness and not feeling well. The patient was pale and hypertensive. She was carried on a stretcher and placed on oxygen. Rapid response team was called in and treatment with intravenous (iv) fluids including iv push of famotidine at a dose of 20 mg was initiated. Patient was transported to the Emergency Department (ED) for further evaluation. Additionally, the patient received iv treatment with methylprednisolone succinate at a dose 125 mg and diphenhydramine at a dose of 25 mg. Throat tightness and upper chest pressure were reported to be relieved. The patient was discharged with prescriptions for oral prednisone, famotidine, and diphenhydramine to be taken as needed for recurrent symptoms.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events of  throat tightness, upper chest pressure, and not feeling well was not reported.   The events, throat tightness, upper chest pressure, and not feeling well were considered resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 52-year-old, female subject who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 039K20A), experienced the unexpected events of not feeling well; upper chest pressure and not feeling well. The onset of events occurred 5 min after the first dose of vaccine administration. The reporter causality assessment for the events was not provided. Due to the temporal association between the events and the administration of vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, and the events are assessed as possibly related to vaccine.

                                                I had my first dose of the vaccine on Monday morning. I woke up Tuesday morning with a very sore arm, which I expected. I was also very tired with a bit of a headache. I teach school, and throughout the day I had very little energy and went to bed early that night. The next day (Wednesday) I felt the same, really wiped out, but also had some gastrointestinal issues and little appetite. Thursday I felt the same. Today is Friday, and I&#39;m still dragging a bit but my appetite is returning. I feel like I&#39;m getting back to normal.

                                                MADERNA COVID-19 Vaccine EUA ; Within 6 minutes, experienced warming feeling through chest followed by light headed and dizziness, followed by immediate sensation of nausea. Then lost awareness and surrounding noise sounded as if I were in a cave, echoes and non-discernable. Lost consciousness for several minutes.  Next recollection was regaining awareness, clothes soaked with sweat. Was lying on a bed with no recollection of being moved to the bed. Shakes and feeling of distress. Experienced shakes and a tingling sensation for approximately 15 minutes. Once that subsided I experienced chills for the better part of an hour. Would like to add, I have no phobias of injections and regularly have blood samples drawn for medical evolutions with my primary care physician.  Was counselled by administering physician to go home and skip work.

Within minutes in addition to the face flush  my arthritis pain spiked in my left wrist, and is still worse than the pain was prior to the MRNA. I am having some  runny nose which started later in day of vaccine as well. On that day at one point when I ran up the stairs my breathing felt heavier than normal.

She was not short of breath and was not developing throat tightness but she was given 1 dose of epinephrine 0.3 mg intramuscular. Her allergy symptoms quickly resolved.

                                                The first injection I received was from an empty syringe, the healthcare worker told me she didn?t notice it was empty until after she gave it to me and said she would need to inject me again, which she did immediately after noticing the empty syringe. I immediately felt a burning sensation going down my arm but did not have any immediate pain. Approx. 3 1/2 - 4 hrs later, my muscle where I received the injection began feeling very sore. After several days, I used a lidocaine patch on my arm which eased the pain so it was tolerable. However, today is the 11th day of my pain and I have not been able to sleep through the night for the past 3 nights due to excruciating pain that wakes me up and I am unable to raise my arm. The pain and my range of motion for my arm has progressively gotten worse by the day with today being close to unbearable.

                                                It started with a fever of 99.8 (norm is 97.4). I had brain fog. really slow thoughts. I felt like my brain was in slow motion. Big time fatigue. I felt like I was carrying a truck. I also noticed with my MS I am wobbly but I can catch myself but I felt like it was getting much worse. I called my Dr. and she thinks that the vaccine caused a flare-up in my MS. She gave me a prednisone pack. the last dose of prednisone I took, I was still fatigued. I began using a walker because I couldn&#39;t walk safely. I noticed as I tried to get out of my car a few days later I was thrown backwards which caused me to land on my glasses which cut my face and resulted in stitches. I did test but my MS was not in an active flare but they said it could be in a flare because of the COVID vaccine. they couldn&#39;t give me medication because that medication causes heart spasms. I was denied by my insurance to go to rehab. I cant walk and I am currently in the hospital.

                                                Received vaccine on 12/30/2020: Experienced 5-7 Days of neuropathy, itching.  Six hours after injection, I woke up with extreme flushing, but no fever. Worst part was, I had like a tingling and burning sensation that radiated to my extremities legs and feet. Sweating in feet that came in waves. I felt like my skin was on fire, like I was too close to a heater. Waves of numbness and tingling that was constant that lasted for approximated 5 days. Bad taste in mouth like a metallic taste. Blood pressure was extremely high. Worse at night. I went to ER on 1/3/21, because I was still having waves of burning and discomfort that was raising my blood pressure. I thought after 72 hours I would be better and it did not so this is why I went to ER.  Day 5, I had lost of taste, runny nose, light nausea. By day 6, the cough turned into itchy throat discomfort. Day 7 low grade fever. Day 8, everything started to subside.

Rash went away.  SOB lasted off and on for several days. Heart rate was off when I was working out for a couple of weeks.  I work out  so we wear heart rate monitors.  Heart rate did not recover as quickly as normal during my workouts. Took a couple of weeks for this to get back to normal for me.  Just really felt &#34;off&#34; for awhile and not like myself.  Did not feel comfortable getting second shot because of the above symptoms.

About 20 minutes after the shot my face turned red and lasted about 5 hours.

I told her I was feeling a little foggy. She gave me a bottle of water and kept checking on me every few mins. At around 935 she took me into the back with the medics to get my vitals. They hooked me up to their defib machine for my vitals. My BP was 190/111. They did it manually and it was 180/110. I was starting a headache. By the time I left my BP was 165/99.  I then went to work. At lunchtime my BP was 148/99. I still had a headache for the rest of the day

I went to occupational health at work. They game me hydrocortisone cream 1%.  1/9/2021 I woke up to swollen red arm, warm to the touch. Reddened area grew outside of pen marked area. Began having tachycardia and an increase in blood pressure and headache. I made an appointment with online doctor who said to monitor BP and if higher seek medical attention. Got off phone and felt dizzy. Took my blood pressure again and it was much higher so I went to the ER. ER determined it was reaction to vaccine

Usual &amp; expected solicited SEs: fatigue, soreness, feeling &#34;off,&#34; transient headache, chills sx Day 2- strong R arm pain, cannot lift R arm.  Metallic taste in mouth and tingling tongue persists.  Also same usual Sx as day 1 plus mild nausea.   Felt really crummy.   Day 3- Still moderately strong R arm pain, can only partially lift arm over head, cannot straighten over head.   Strong fatigue continues, mild nausea.   By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

Symptoms did not resolve after a few hours.  ~ 3 hours later, took Benadryl and bronchodiolator and symptoms improved.  Also since injection have had mild GI distress gradually improving.   Reporting now because I learned reaction could be worse to second injection, and 30 minute observation period would likely be prudent.

The itching continued and became increasingly worse.  Then, in addition to the moderate itching, there was a welt, swollen with redness and warm to the touch.  The welt grew in size.  Treatment included going to an Immediate Care where I received a steroid injection, steroid cream and a Medrol pack.

                                                within 30 seconds I had a cooling sensation rush across the tip of my tongue, then a sweet taste, then more identifiable as bubble gum flavored.  By 12:45 I noticed I was scratching several areas of my body. Arms, legs, chest, neck, back and scalp and kept clearing my throat.  I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

                                                the reaction began about 45 minutes after Moderna vaccine. I began to notice tingling in my hands and feet first. My right foot felt a little stiff when picking it up from the gas to the break while driving home. I noticed shortly after I arrived home itching and tingling all over and more pronounced picking, burning, numbness in my mouth(tongue and chin), hands and feet,  No rash, no shortness of breath. I took a Benadryl hoping just a mild reaction that would clear up. Next morning my feet and hands woke me up from the tingling and cramping. Other symptoms off and on were spasms in my feet and pain in index and middle fingers when touching cold. I called my doctor on Monday morning to get in for an appointment after I was awakened with some cramping in my calves and was more concerned. Was told if it worsened or I had any SOB or weakness in extremities to go to the ER. My reflexes were checked and normal and no weakness in my muscles. No other tests done at that time. The symptoms persist with buzzing feeling in them off and on, feeling of stiffness and stabbing feeling on occasion, no more cramps in calves. It remains mostly ankles to feet but some numbness to below knees. Hands, no further than wrist, along with chin and tongue remain numb and tingling at times.

Very sore; whole region around the lymph node really sore and tender to the touch  Had a hard time lifting arm up because it would slide under my clavicle and it really hurt. . Now it is down to the size of a pea. can still feel it  but the pain has subsided. My doctor has seen 12 people so far who has had that reaction.

About 48 hours after I felt very fatigue, almost too exhausted to get ready for work. The following two days I felt nauseated, very fatigued, achy and interrupted sleep patterns - going to bed earlier than usual, waking up between 2-4am. 4 today after still fatigued aches. The 6th day I felt better with energy, then that evening came the headache and by the following morning (7th day) felt fatigued with chills. The head ache woke me up from sleep at 1 am that night and 3:45am the following night. By the Friday 1/15/21 I still had chills, broke out in a sweat walking throughout house, still tired but not as bad and the headache is gone. I felt so bad onvthe 14th I went and saw a Doctor who suggested I was having a severe reaction to the vaccin. He said my vitals were good, performed a covid test to rule out the possibility (turned out negative) and told me to rest. He also warned the 2nd dose could be worse reaction.

                                                Vaccine given at work left arm on Friday 1:45 pm and felt like tight Blood Pressure cuff  on my arm within 30 mins. This was constant pressure that lasted until I slept that night.  went home after work, ate dinner, then sleep with my CPAP. Slept late, woke up 1:40pm with entire left arm numb, but still able to move it. (sleeping on right side) and numb tongue that felt swollen. Stroke?  I got up and as time progressed over next 30 mins or so, I started coughing more, felt like sore throat, itchy, having trouble clearing my throat, some trouble breathing, tongue didn&#39;t look swollen, but it felt like scotch tape underneath my tongue with someone slowly pulling tape off. with top of tongue swollen and heavy.  2:25pm I took 25 mg Benadryl oral tablet and called 24/7 RN hotline and was told to go to ER and take another 25 mg Benadryl tablet which I did. I arrived at ER and was really coughing hacking repeatedly. Short of breath, kept trying to clear my throat. Seen in triage. No meds given, this was? &lt;20 from time I took Benadryl.  About an hour later I did have about 15 mins of feeling like I was wearing a very snug neck turtleneck with 2 brief cool sensations going down the middle of my throat and down both sides of my upper chest.   I felt better when I kept my neck very straight versus looking down.  I was later seen again and felt 75% better, given Dexamethasone and Pepcid.  Discharged home. around 6:30pm.  Took Benadryl 50 mg again 10 pm same night.

                                                a couple hours after the vaccine, I experienced a bit of rapid heart rate, which resolved after a few minutes. The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

Muscle and bone aches through my spine and hips, nausea with some vomiting, chills, severe weakness, no recordable fever but felt feverish, skin hurt. Woke up Tuesday drenched in sweat but the bone pain had subsided. Still very weak, nauseous, continued in bed. Woke up today feeling on fire, eyes burning hot, skin no longer hurt but felt hot.  Injection site hurt through Sunday-no redness, no rash or swelling.  I took Tylenol and Advil throughout.  My previous trunk rash completely disappeared. I began taking the prednisone last night. 50mg BID. I have a 5 day supply.  Took a Covid test on Monday-results pending.  Tried to see my doctor today giving them the above information-there were no appts til Friday and I was referred to the ED.  I will not go to the ED where I could actually catch Covid. I was unable to get past phone triage with the doctors office.

About an hour later while watching TV, a hot flash/flush came over my head and upper torso. I noticed bright red checks and nose which resolved within a couple hours (without any intervention). Temp was elevated per touch, and clammy. Blood pressure was elevated for several days 160-180s/86-100. A small scar on my finger from cyst removal 7 wks prior became inflamed and red w/ burning/tingling for 3 days.   Anticipated SE did included head ache, sore arm, fatigue and sleepiness for 2.5 days. (previous vaccines only resulted in sore arm--all other SE above (esp becoming possessed with fury), were new experiences.

                                                Office visit 1/26: The employee is having right-sided back pain radiating down to her knee since 1/19/2021. She relates this pain to a vaccine for Covid which she received on 1/12/2021.  She has a history of right-sided shoulder tendinitis after flu vaccine and so she refuses to get the vaccine in her deltoid muscle and usually gets vaccines in her right gluteal area.  She had the vaccine for Covid on 1/12/2021 in the right hip area a little bit higher than where she normally gets it.  She developed some redness to the injection site which subsided but soon afterwards began having right-sided sacral pain and then right-sided knee pain. The pain is described as a ache and burning.  She does not have numbness and tingling down her leg.  And she does not have any limitation in terms of flexion or extension of her back but she finds that she cannot lie on her back at night because it hurts.  She also has trouble getting out of a chair because of right knee pain. She was seen by the orthopedist,  he has ordered an EMG which came out negative, and ordered to take Naprosyn twice a day. Dx: Lumbosacral radiculopathy at L3. F/U on 1/28: At this time she still having some dull right-sided back pain and pain to her knee but it is tolerable. She has been able to rest over the course of this week as she has not gone to work. She feels at this time that she can manage her pain and is able to start working this weekend on 1/30/2021. We expect that the pain will gradually subside as the effect of the injection subsides as well.

                                                I woke up at 4 in the morning itching my hands and elbows.  I got up and put some cream on it, and continued to itch at different parts of my body.  I got up and tried different itch creams to no relief.   I also have a cough, feels like I have something in my throat.  I then took some benaryl and that helps relief the itch for about 6-7 hours, then I have to take another dose. I still have red patches on my body (hands, elbows, armpits, neck, and feet.)  These go away some when I take a benadryl.

I looked it up and found out that it was something that some people get.  I have not recovered yet, but expect to in a few days.

                                                About a day after the 1st vaccine, I got a rash on my face that felt like sandpaper.  My face was became more swollen after four days and finally started decreasing in swelling after the 5th day.  My eyelids were the most noticeable.

                                                Within 6 hours of vaccination, intense pain in the right arm - could not lift it overhead without pain.  This continued - and got worse on Friday morning.  The Friday morning event is what I am reporting.  I got up to shower; put shampoo in my hair and then conditioner. My right arm was hurting so badly that I was having trouble rinsing my hair. Then I felt faint and nauseous. Got out of the shower and fell onto the bed in the bedroom. Woke my husband to tell him that I was feeling badly - faint and the whole room was spinning. Then I felt my airway closing. He went down to get my levalbuterol (rescue inhaler); took one puff and that opened my airways.  I was still weak and he had to help me get dressed.  (BTW- I&#39;m a competitive athlete/ swimmer.)  I held onto him going downstairs.  I was not hungry though did eat a bit.  I spent the day on the couch with the chills and the room spinning until early afternoon.  By Saturday I was starting to feel better.  The pain in my arm mostly subsided by Sunday and I went to swim practice.  It wiped me out for the entire day and I spent the rest of Sunday on the couch. It&#39;s now Monday morning. I am feeling a bit off but better.  I am concerned about getting the second shot.

It started with hives and oral angioedema I was able to quell with some on hand steroids and high does Benadryl - I am an ARNP .

My temporary measures could not keep it at bay. I was emergently taken to ER trauma bay and aggressively treated with Epi  0.3 IM x 2 high dose solumedrol x 3  125 mg and 60 mg IV and 50 mg Benadryl IV X3  Pepcid IV X1 then admitted to telemetry for severity overnight

No further complaints of allergic like reaction after Benadryl was administerd.

The following day, my left arm was swollen and felt tight, and was much more red, with an increased diameter to approximately 3.5 inches.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine, I noticed a rash at the injection site.  The rash has continued to spread down my arm.  It is red, burning, and sore to the touch.  I contacted my primary care provider, who prescribed a topical steroid.  I have taken photos of the rash since it started.  It has not improved and continues to spread.

That night I had severe left arm soreness to the point where I needed a narcotic, I had some at home. The pain woke me up. The next day I was more tired and had a stomach ache and more fatigue, left arm sore took Tylenol, fluids and did not call my doctor. Went to bed with a narcotic. Sunday into Monday 1/9 -1/10 I had severe diarrhea and could not eat, sore throat, muscle aches, decreased left arm soreness.  Full relief by Thursday.

                                                One week following my 1st vaccination, on Monday January 11, I developed small red bumps at the injection site, which turned into one big, itchy welt by the end of that same day. I visited my PCP the next afternoon, on Tuesday, January 12th. He said it was not a systemic reaction but a localized reaction to the vaccine and prescribed a 5-day Medrol pack and Hydroxyzine. I was also experiencing episodes of anxiety beginning 2 days following my injection, on Wednesday, January 6 th. The redness is subsiding at this time - approximately 50% improvement; some itchiness persists if I don&#39;t take the hydroxyzine regularly (I don&#39;t because I have to work and it makes me very sleepy). Anxiety is improved, as well.

Large red welt about 1/2 inch beneath injection site noticed it within an hour; itchy and grew to about the 1 1/2&#34; in diameter.  By day three post injection, it has diminished by 90%. 3.  Approximately 20 minutes after injection, face and lips became numb predominantly on the right side.  Similar feeling to when one receives novocaine.  Could  not see any visible swelling.  This peaked about 1 hour after shot and was gone about 4-5 hours after shot.

                                                On evening of my injection (12/30/20), within 15 to 30 minutes post injection I had tingling in my lips and anterior/distal 1/2 of my tongue, medicinal taste in mouth, slight loss of taste, and mild lightheadedness that resolved overnight. On the next day, noticed about a 3 inch wide (across) and 1 inch long (head to toe) redness with a hard lump in my left arm/where the injection site was. Redness and hardness took about 3-4 days to resolve and my arm had a deep itch to it as the redness resolved. On 01/06/21 arm redness returned with the itching  with some itching of my face and head but resolved in a couple of days.

No other reactions during the 15 minute monitoring period. Within approx 25 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I experienced tingling and slight numbness of my lips. This progressed to numbness and tingling of both cheeks.  No swelling. No progression or worsening of described symptoms. This numbness/tingling continued for approximately 40 minutes then self-resolved.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

                                                Arm turned red at injection site and hot. There was really no pain and went away within a couple of day but turned red again exactly a week later from injection date. This time it was hard, hot, red, itchy, and bigger. Dr treated it with clindamycin and dose pack of steroids. It got better after a few days. Next, I got a UTI and called my primary care physician. She ordered CIPRO and phenazopyridine. That got better but before CIPRO was finished, I got a crick in my neck that turned into excruciating pain in my neck and was unable to turn head from side to side. At the same time, my left foot became painful, red and swelled. I have been treated for arthritis in that foot 6 years ago with an injection. I have not had any problems with it since the injection.  Dr. treated my neck problem with Robaxin and a steroid dose pack. This seemed to help my foot too temporarily. Neck pain improved but not gone. It was excruciating pain up the back of my scalp at times. I can turn my head some now but it&#39;s not back normal. Can&#39;t turn it all the way.  Dr. did another injection in my foot but did not work this time. I got worse and I can no longer put any weight on that foot. I have not been able to work since January 20. Have had to apply for leave of absence and short-term disability

                                                On Tuesday went to work and at around 1:30 she told her boss that she was not feeling good.  Felt achy in her body, her arm was hurting and was not feeling like herself.  She went home, sat on the sofa and drank something and went to sleep and felt drained, and slept for 4 hours.  She then woke up with runny nose, low grade temp, and felt really weak.  The next day, 1/6/21 her body ached bad.  She slept a lot that day and drank a lot of water, didn&#39;t eat and just felt really sick.  Then on Saturday evening, she looked at her leg and felt cold chills and her leg was hot.  She looked at her leg and had an area that was like a red dot, and she then realized that her leg was about to be inflamed.  She went to bed, woke up and her entire leg was blotchy red, swollen and hot.  She then called her family and around 12:00 on Monday 1/11/21.  She went to the hospital, and they treated her like she had COVID, isolated her and was negative.  Sent her to vascular and did not have a blood clot in her leg, and told her she had an cellulitis flair, and she started being treated with IV antibiotics.  Was in the hospital for 5 days.  She was discharged and went home after infectious disease team told her to go home with a nurse on IV antibiotics.  She came home on 1/15/21, and was off the IV antibiotics on 1/22/21.   She has been home and unable to work.  She is going to therapy for her legs.  They changed her hypertension medications, and put back on her antibiotics last week as they told her that the swelling was not going down.  Her kidney function is low and told today, 2/9/21 that she is concerned about her kidney function.  She is to have more labs drawn on Monday, 2/15/21.

This lasted about five days before the inflammation and swelling went away. I also experienced a little bit of sort of light- headedness or sort of feeling just a little like my balance was off. As of today, Feb. 22, my arm is much better, but I am still a little bit light-headed. I have Rosacea, and that has also flared up horribly, and my face is a little bit red and inflamed

On day 2 my lips began to swell and were itchy, by day 3 they were very swollen, took benadryl every 8 hrs and by day 5 today they are fairly normal but still sore. My arm also swelled and spread to arm pit and was very hot and red. The redness has mostly gone, the swelling has lessened but not gone. Still sore and itchy. Still pretty run down and no energy. My cousin and I live together and were vaccinated at the same time and both had these symptoms except the lips swelling.

It felt like pins and needles. When it went on for several hours I called Hospital and they advised to contact them if it worsened of I began having symptoms of Bells Palsey or a stroke (not concerning at all!)  I took tylenol then ibuprofen and it went away. It&#39;s come back two more days (up to today) but has not worsened. Just thought I should report it.

                                                About five hours after injection, my face turned red and felt like a very bad sunburn. I also had blotchy red hives on my arms, hands, abdomen and legs. I had taken Benadryl at 9;3 0 am and my injection was about 11 AM.  I went to Health. At the clinic I was told to go to the ER. At the ER, a nurse checked my vitals and a doctor looked in my mouth. Other than the hives, everything was normal. I was advised that all they could do was give me more Benadryl. Since they were overwhelmed with trauma patients, I chose to go home. I took more Benadryl and within about 4 hours, the redness and hives went away.

                                                10 minutes after vaccine I got a warm rush up left neck to left side of head with and instant severe headache which I would rate 9/10, dizziness, nausea and felt like I was about to pass out. After about 10 minutes the headache and dizziness eased but headache remained at 6/10. 40minutes after vaccine the nausea returned much worse, my ears felt full &amp; tongue felt weird. Took 2 Benadryl, slept 12hours. Next morning: I still have headache which migraine medicine not Aleves are helping. My tongue still feels weird, my lips and nose feel numb.

The nurse could see me turning red and feel the heat on my body. My BP and HR were also high. After those symptoms started leaving I became extremely cold. My hands stayed so cold they could not get a reading on my oxygen level. I did not feel short of breath at any time. I had a total of 4 episodes like this with each one being smaller and leaving sooner. They gave me juice and a graniola bar, kept checking my temp and blood pressure. After an hour to hour and half I was released to my son and husband. I took a benedryl whenI left.

Around 10pm, right armpit got super itchy Day 6: Lymph node in right arm pit area super swollen and very painful Day 7: Right arm lymph node still swollen and sore when I woke up, pain and swelling dissapated during the day, however around 11am the injection site area started to itch. When I felt it it had swelled. To say it itched is an understatement. Day 8: Right arm lymph node mildly swollen, no pain. Injection site red in area slightly larger then the area of my palm. Slightly warm and SUPER itchy. Day 9: Injection site still red, although slightly less so, slightly warm , and barely itchy.

                                                Got the vaccine on Friday and 14 hours later , early Saturday morning,  I started feeling sick. It started with severe chills, and graduated into fever, lethargy, nausea, hyperventilating, headache, and chills interchanging with sweating.   I had a fever the entire weekend and it wouldn&#39;t go away, even with taking Advil and Tylenol.  My oxygen level was fine, but my pulse was elevated.  I felt the same as when I had Covid-19 in June, to the point where I thought I had it again, so I quarantined myself, and was going to get tested on Monday. On Sunday afternoon, I started to feel better and thought it was the end of it, but then Sunday night I started shivering again, and it all started again.     I took an Ambien to get some good sleep and I woke up at 6am Monday morning feeling better.

Tried to stay hydrated, took tylenol and motrin alternatively all day, loss of taste and smell, could not focus to read anything all day and into evening of 1/7/2021.  At about 830 pm on 1/7/2021, began to feel slight improvement in balance and cognition. Went to bed early and woke up about 2 or 3 am on 1/8/2021 drenched from fever breaking I suspect. Rash on face after fever broke. Continued with tylenol and motrin and hydration, gradual improvement into early morning of 1/8/2021 and by the afternoon, I was very much improved. However, lingering parastethesias in left jaw, neck, ear and into left arm and fingers, even today 1/11/2020.

I quickly started to vomit intensely and repeatedly for several hours.  Towards the beginning of the vomiting, I believe I passed out and hit my head on the floor.   I don&#39;t recall hitting my head at all but had a large swollen bump on my forward.  My husband said he heard the fall.  I had no food in my system so vomiting  was dry heaves , bile and any water I was able to drink.  Symptoms decreased over the next 4-5 hours.  I still  have a more mild headache and slight nausea on 1/11/21.

By 12Noon, I noticed my left upper lip had swollen quite a bit, and then then swelling progressed across my entire upper lip, and then outward to my bilateral cheeks, and upward to my nasal area and to my bilateral orbits. My left side was worse then my right. the progression occurred over the course of Jan 9th and again Jan 10th, but as it progressed outward, it subsided slowly from where it started (my upper lip)

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving vaccine, I felt something in my neck(left side/vaccine in left arm) within a few minutes, my chin, and jaw started feeling weird/tingly-I brought it to the receptionist&#39;s attention, and she got a nurse, next few minutes, my face on the left side; especially lips and right below felt tingly/numb(like local dental anesthetic). My speech was Ok, my BP was monitored and was  a little elevated, nurse thought I was a little anxious because of my symptoms, BP was checked again about 10 minutes later and it was normal, they listened to my lungs to-all seemed to be well, except for these changing sensations going up my face, and lip. I stayed for about 20 minutes more, and returned to my office. Throughout the day changing sensations/lip area-that evening, my family said my lower lip was  drooping slightly downward-it seemed a bit swollen as well.  I checked in with the Covid Vaccine Clinic Wed. 01/13/20 in the AM as asked, and let them know i was still having symptoms in my lips, and felt slightly swollen on the one side.   It is 1/13/2020 @ 8:45PM and my bottom lip still feels strange(fluttery/tinglingly-not quite numb in sensation/  my cheeks/chin have intermittent differences in sensation

Next dose scheduled for 1/22 and do not want to take it until I get official direction on what needs to be done proactively and after the next vaccine to ensure my safety.

Developed a delayed reaction to the vaccine 12 days after receiving  it.  Developed a rash that is approxiamently 3.5 inches wide by  5 inches in length.  It is dark in color and raised as well as itchy.  I am also experiencing tingling in my tongue and lips as well as feeling that my tongue is slightly swollen as well as my throat.   The rash is warm to the touch and slightly sensitive to touch as well, and is  giving off heat.  It has gotten slightly larger in the past 2 days.  I DO NOT have a fever. Monday evening started taking Allegra.  It helps to keep the reaction I am having in my mouth and the itchiness for about 12 hours

                                                I started with a pain in the left arm similar to the aching I felt the day after my  vaccine.  It felt worse this morning, and I looked in  the mirror since it felt so hot and it is a very large oval- red outline rash.  Not raised,  just mostly red on the border and hot and angry .  Feels more painful inside , like &#34;sharp, and achy&#34; and a worse headache than the day after the shot .   The headache is progressively getting worse.  I have taken my migraine Rx- 1- Fioricet earlier so I could work, but it did not help.  My PCP suggested putting a  topical cortisone cream on the rash, I have not gotten that yet.  Perhaps unrelated, but for the record, this past Tuesday, 1/19/21, I had such bad vertigo that I could not even telework, and that&#39;s a 1st.

                                                Patient is a 55-year-old female who had presented to the vaccination clinic this afternoon to receive her COVID-19 vaccine.  She does have a history of migraine headaches and other comorbidities as described below.  Has had reactions to a number of medications, mostly narcotics as noted in her allergy list some of which could in theory be compatible with urticaria.  Does not have true anaphylaxis in her history. Today at about 15 minutes after administration of her COVID-19 vaccine she began to rather precipitously developed an itchy crawling feeling in her skin, nausea with retching and some shortness of breath.  She did not have the sensation of her throat closing off.  Did not have coryza.  Within about 10 minutes she did develop difficulty with speech that she says is typical for her migraine headache.  She received, in the vaccination Clinic, epinephrine 0.3 mg subQ, 125 mg of Solu-Medrol and 50 mg of Benadryl all IV.  An IV was started and a 500 mL bolus of saline was initiated.  With this she was then transferred to the emergency room for further evaluation.   In the emergency room she did develop chest heaviness but no palpitations.  She was not dyspneic.  Her nausea and vomiting by then had seem to resolve.

Took 25 mg benadryl and Proair inhaler. Feeling of throat tightness started to relieve within 20 minutes. No further problem with the throat tightness after that. Asthma flared slightly after injection but controlled with routine asthma meds.

It also had a burning sensation and was itchy.  I monitored it throughout the day and took a anti-histamine later that evening. The following day the redness had spread further down the arm but overall less hot to the touch and no longer burning or itchy.

                                                Within 30 minutes after having the vaccine, she felt a thickness in her throat and then had trouble swallowing.  She reported this to the authorities.  They took her vitals which showed that her oxygen saturation was 99%, heart rate was 78 and blood pressure was normal.  They eventually let her go home.  She was not given any Benadryl or any other medications.  The following day on February 13, she was fine.  Later on that day, she developed some sudden onset of itching from the neck up.  Even the insides of her ears were itching.  This lasted 3 to 4 hours and then disappeared by itself.  On February 14th and 15 she said she was suffering from the usual side effects expected from the vaccine including fatigue and a low-grade fever of 99.6 but these again went away by themselves.  The following week, on February 17, she developed more generalized itching all over her body including feet legs and everywhere.  It was similar to the itching that she had developed when she was allergic to sulfa medication.  Discontinued on Thursday.  Now she continues to have some itching but not as bad as on the 17th and 18th.

When I woke up on the 18th I could barely walk. My right knee was swollen, both hands were swollen, I had pain in my neck to the base of my skull.  I called the doctor&#39;s office and told this was normal and to take Tylenol. I spent the weekend barely able to move by the following Thursday, February 25th I went to my doctor, who immediately sent me to the ER. I was admitted to the hospital. My inflammation was high.  I was dehydrated. I spent the night in the hospital. Doctors say there is not enough research to say this vaccine did this but  I know it did. I am still having problems, still can barely walk, pain in the joints of my hands and pain radiating up my neck to the bottom of my skull.

                                                50 minutes after administration of the vaccine, the patient started to feel  like her throat was somewhat itchy and tight.  There was no wheezing or difficulty breathing.  IM benadryl was administered immediately, and blood pressure taken--which was found to be elevated.  Blood pressure continued to elevate further to the 180s/110s, and patient developed a &#34;pounding headache&#34;  She also complained of pressure behind her eyes and &#34;a funny feeling in my face&#34; (bilateral).  She was given 0.1mg of clonidine and was taken to the hospital by EMS

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   I had chills, low grade fever of 99.4 initially, fatigue, lightheaded and  felt like I was moving in slow motion.  As the evening progressed, I felt worse and worse, had no appetite, very slight nausea, but no vomiting. During the night, my fever went up.  I only checked it once and it was 100.1, but I was having severe chills, my knee joints were aching, as well as some of my fingers.  The next morning I had a headache, and was dizzy (which may have been from not eating the night before). The symptoms continued throughout the day, but were managed fairly well with Tylenol.  Additionally, my arm was extremely sore.  It hurt to move it in any way.  Even worse arm pain than with a Tetanus shot, which has always caused me a great deal of pain.  Thankfully the symptoms only lasted about 28 hours.

Returned to the site to be monitored by the doctor. Was advised to take a Benadryl (within 30 minutes of injection). The head issues continued in waves for about 2 hours. My throat felt tight, but never closed off. Once home I experienced a fever of 100 for approximately 2 hours. Remedied by acetaminophen.  Slept well and woke with no further symptoms except slight injection site soreness.

Home from work on January 6th, day of initial dose. Started with chills after arriving  home at approx 8pm.  Went to bed and woke sometime around midnight with the above described symptoms. Symptoms  cont throughout the day (January 8th) . Finally out of bed by evening and was able to hold down food. Back to bed and woke sometime around 3 am after breaking a sweat. Fever was gone and my body cooler. Up that morning around 9. Normal, tolerable body aches, mild headache and left arm very sore but could tolerate it being touched.   Side Note: I had contracted the virus in March 2020.  The symptoms from the vaccine were so much worse than the actual virus. I am too scared to get the second dose.

It didn&#39;t seem to progress so I wasn&#39;t concerned.  I also developed the typical immune response (headache and sore arm) later in the evening on 1/2/2021.  On 1/3/2021, I woke up with a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and mild shortness of breath.  These symptoms continued on 1/4/2021, however, the symptoms were improved when I woke up on 1/5/2021.  On 1/7/2021, I received an allergy infection.  Within 24 hours I re-developed a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath (all vitals were stable).  Since I had no improvement in symptoms, I consulted with a physician and was placed on antibiotics and advised to continue with albuterol inhaler.  I&#39;m now slowly improving with my symptoms.  I reviewed this information with my allergist and they have advised me to not get the second Moderna vaccine, in case if what I experienced was some form of a mild-moderate allergic reaction.  I personally feel it is also quite possible that I could have had onset of an upper respiratory infection just after receiving the Moderna vaccine, and this may possibly not have been an allergic reaction.  Since this was not the normal course, I felt it should be reported regardless.

When I awoke at 5:00 AM my head felt foggy, I had chills, and headache.  I took extra strength Tylenol at 6:00 AM with relief of headache, but returned to bed from 9:00 AM to noon due to fatigue, muscle aches and chills.  I have continued to have fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and chills throughout the day (1/14/21). I also developed a fever of 100.6 at 5:00 PM.  Second dose of tylenol has reduced my temp to 99.5, but I continue to feel fatigued with headache.  The current time is 6:15 PM on 1/14.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine on Jan 8. I had some soreness in my arm for a couple days. Then about 4- 5 days in, I developed a large local reaction with redness, pain, hot to touch, and itching. This persisted and worsened over the ensuing week. The itching was pretty severe and the area was very hot to touch and painful. On Saturday, I developed some tongue itchiness- very strange sensation. I treated it with some Benadryl and Ibuprofen with some relief but not resolution.

I made a phone call trying relax but mid call  I could not speak due to throat and tongue swelling and then development of a cough trying to clear my throat.  I grabbed my sons epi pen but I was able to still get air so I didn?t use it. My husband transported me to the ER. They took my straight back took my vitals and administered Benadryl, Pepcid and Dexamethasone  IM  and worked well, they observed me for few hours and I was released. I have follow-up appt tomorrow with primary care,

My hands and feet got tingly and then while I was on the phone my tongue and throat swelled and unable  to speak and started to cough. But couldn?t clear my throat . I was able to get enough oxygen. My husband drove my to ER and which time they took my straight back took my vitals and gave me Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroid injection and it worked! They observed me few hours and sent me home.  I was unable to sleep  last night and a hallucination that concerned my husband but otherwise  I?m just achy today, note I never had a fever.

On 13 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) in the left arm intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 13 Jan 2021, at 0845, 7 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient arrived for observation at urgent care. The patient stated she felt faint and her lip was starting to &#34;feel swollen&#34; and tingling. Initial vital signs were: blood pressure  147/79, heart rate  69, respirations  20 and oxygen saturation  99 percent. A nurse practitioner and doctor evaluated the patient and noted patient had oropharyngeal edema and lungs were clear to auscultation (CTA).   At 0851, diphenhydramine 25 milligrams orally was given with no effect. Facial redness and edema worsened.  At 0855, epinephrine 3 milligrams was given with improvement, but after 5 minutes, facial redness and lower lip worsened.   At 0902, a second dose of epinephrine was given.  At 0903, vital signs were: blood pressure  162/87, heart rate  104, respirations  20 and oxygen saturation  100 percent on 4 liters of oxygen. Facial redness and edema improved but still had swelling and tingling of lower lip.  At 0909, emergency medical services (EMS) were called and patient was transported to emergency room/department.   Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine, epinephrine and oxygen.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events, lower lip tingling, pale in color, periorbital and generalized facial edema and facial redness, were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 56-year-old, female patient. The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient experienced serious, unexpected event of periorbital swelling, facial swelling, oropharyngeal edema and unexpected events of Paraesthesia oral, erythema, pallor and dizziness. The events occurred 8 minutes after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

(Can&#39;t have PPD done anymore due to allergic reaction). This new lesion appeared to look just like the PPD reaction with raised swelling, redness and itch. Applied Benadryl cream and swelling and itch went away within 4 hours leaving a red spot.  I have photos documenting it from start to end.

                                                About one minute after receiving the injection, ( approximately 9 AM) I felt my heart rate increase to about 100 bpm, and I just did not feel right.  I told the nurses I didn&#39;t feel right, and I sat down for about 10 minutes and drank 3 glasses of water.  Initially I felt better, but then I felt weak and &#34;not right&#34;,  so I lay down on a cot for approximately 40 minutes.  My B/P was elevated (165/95), which is very high for me.  I did not have any trouble breathing.  I continued to drink water, and eventually my B/P lowered, and I felt better.  I took an antihistamine (10 mg Zyrtec) when I arrived home at 11:00 AM, and felt very tired until about 3:30 PM,  when I felt just about back to normal.  I was assessed by an ER physician at the clinic site.

I had fever, headache, chills, muscle and joint pain, extreme fatigue and slept for hours all day Saturday, Sunday into Monday, which I called off work. I felt as if I had the virus all over again , except this time it felt much worse. I am worried to get the second vaccine as it states it is worse than the first. Would like and appreciate any feedback on this.

                                                First shot of Moderna vaccine.  Had the shot and waited around 35 minutes and I felt fine.  I left and was a few minutes down the street and my lips started going numb. I turned around and went back to the hospital where the shot was administered and they had me see the emergency room doctor.  My throat did not start closing, my lips just were numb.  I have had serious reactions before and they start with the lips usually so I was concerned.  My blood pressure was high as well as my pulse.  The doctor gave me prednisone and benadryl and I was feeling good after 15 minutes.  I was in the ER 45 minutes to an hour and then was released with a script to take prednisone and benadryl for the next 4 days.and to come back if I got worse.  I never got a rash or anything else, just the numb lips and increase in blood pressure.  I did have a bit of a headache as well.  I am at work now (the next day) and feeling fine.  I did speak to my doctor and she did advise me not to get the second shot in the vaccine series. .

Another 3 days after that my body went into an acute inflammatory response.  I had extremely pronounced pinkeye (first time ever) followed by acute gout flare-up (first time ever) followed by extreme edema in lower extremities (first time ever).  I&#39;m being treated with steroids, but these issues have yet to resolve.  I have not been able to work since Jan 4.  I can only stand for a few minutes and walk a short distance with the aid of crutches.  In all of my life, I have never had pinkeye or gout or edema, or a UTI for that matter.  I am a healthcare worker and I&#39;m needed back at my job asap.

The decreased sense of taste improved after 24 hours, but the generalized fatigue and injection site discomfort persisted over the next several days. She also experienced body aches, but notes these are fairly typical for her, so she didn&#39;t think much about it. She recalls having headaches and stomachaches around days 3-5 following her injection, and beginning on day 7, she also started to notice some injection site itching and induration.  The localized swelling and redness increased during days 7-10 following her COVID-19 vaccination, and over the last 6 hours, she also started to develop nausea. Her fatigue persists, but the headaches, stomachaches, and body aches have subsided.

I took a Benadryl and used ice on the L shoulder to get to sleep, Advil the next day, then Benadryl again the next night.  I even used some Cortaid to help the itching.

But about 10 days later, I noticed my vaccine site has a large red area and feels warm. It has been like this for 3 days. I have never felt bad or run a fever. Should I seek medical attention, or should I have concerns about getting the second vaccine?

Lasted approximately one hour.  3 hours after injection, broke out with rash and began itching, throat became tight.  I called my PCP who suggested a solumedrol injection along with Benadryl.  I choose to take 20 mg Zyrtec and call 911 if respiratory effect declined.  Had extreme lethargy all day.  Presently, short of breath, aches and such similar to side effects mentioned.

                                                At  12:00pm I experienced chills, shakiness at work and kept working throughout the day. I asked my supervisor if I could leave work bit earlier because I did not feel well.  I went to the break room, sat down when I started feeling lightheaded and passed out in a chair. I had a syncope.  Under my right and left arm, my lymph nsodes felt inflamed  and the ER doctor said they were not inflamed but upon palpation were tender.  I was put on oxygen, my BP was extremely low.  My BP resumed to come back up within a few minutes.   At this time Iam still having trouble with my lungs, Iam on an albuterol inhaler as needed.  I had a folllowup with my PCP on 01-13-21, she extended treatment for Azithromax and  continue with Albuterol inhaler.

                                                Two hours post vaccination:  tongue heaviness followed by metallic taste sensation, vomited once after this.  Four hours post vaccination:  nausea, bilateral forearm pain evolving to all over body aches and muscle cramping along with a pulsating headache.  Spiked a fever of 102 F that I treated with 500 mg of Tylenol.  Later took ibuprofen for body aches.  Had frequent urination along with unexplained crying.  The lowest the fever would measure for the next 24 hours was 100 F.  I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen as directed on a regular basis.  On Thursday 1/21/2021 at 5:55 pm, I woke up drenched in sweat.  I felt weak yet improved.  Headache and back pain were less.  Showered and moved to the couch in living room attempting to watch TV.  Could not stay awake.  Woke up three hours later again drenched in sweat.  Showered and went to bed.  Slept through the night and woke up at 8 am with body aches, muscle cramping and nausea gone.  Night gown and sheets were damp with sweat. Lingering symptoms:  Skin from lips and inside my mouth appears to be sloughing off.  There are very tiny cuts on my bottom lip.  Left with mild headache I attribute to dehydration.  No longer nauseous although I have no appetite.

Then on day eight I went out for a walk and my arm started itching.  Later that evening it started getting red, swelling up and was hot to the touch.. It was also red and swelling up about an inch below the injection site. The rash was going down my arm. There was an aching pain all the way down my left arm to the hand. So painful and swollen I could not sleep on that side for two nights. I still have a bit of the rash today, but it is definitely better on day 11. Should I get the second shot?

Only experience fatigue for first couple of days. 01/03/21 - Around 2pm noticed 3 inch welt across right cheek by 5pm swelling under eyes and random itching around head, neck and face. Headed to doctor 6pm. Saw a PA who said symptoms were not from vaccine when I asked about possibility because of my Hashimotos Thyroiditis. They gave me a steroid shot and called in scrip for Medrol Pack. Later that evening I started also having bad flares of my asthma. Also continued on Benedryl. 01/05/21- started Medrol Pack and continued antihistamines. Very fatigued. 01/10/21-finished Medrol. Still slight welt on right cheek but everything else pretty good. 01/20/21- mid morning noticed welt growing in right cheek and eyes puffing up. By 5pm itching has returned. By 7pm there are now welts and hives on both cheeks and they are  red and hot....asthma flaring badly. Took 30mg prednisone from my medication used for asthma. 01/21/21- things have calmed down redness wise but lots of fatigue. Took 20mg Prednisone. 01/22/21- back to doctor, another Medrol pack. 01/27/21- finished second Medrol pack. Still having slight welts and hives.

I did pre-medicate with Benadryl and Ibuprofen. After returning home added Benadryl and then Benadryl at bedtime. I also had slight leg cramps for approximately 2 hours post injection that lasted about an hour. No further tongue swelling at bedtime, back to normal.

                                                Patient felt unwell and had a fever on Wednesday (1/27) and went home early from work. On Thursday morning (1/28), she threw up once and then laid down to rest. Her son reported seeing her that morning with the episode of emesis prior to her getting on the couch. Son reports that when he came home at 5pm, she was asleep on the couch. Teenage daughter reports patient had been asleep on couch all day. Son tried to wake patient up and she was disoriented and lethargic.  Daughter (reporter) was contacted to come see patient and on arrival to house (5;45pm), noted patient was confused, lethargic, febrile (104), and hypoxic at 83% on room air with portable pulse oximeter. Patient was able to stand and ambulate to car with assistance and was driven to Emergency Department for evaluation.   At emergency department, patient was hypotensive 80/40s but was able to increase blood pressure with 3 L of normal saline to blood pressure of 90/50s. See all tests performed and results below.  Patient received antibiotics, anti-virals and tylenol for fever of 102.7 while in emergency department. She was admitted to ICU that evening at approximately 11pm and had a foley catheter placed overnight due to decreased urine output. patient continued to have low blood pressure through morning of 1/28 and was placed on levophed for blood pressure control at approx 10 am. Her blood pressures continued to improve through afternoon and levophed was titrated down and then discontinued around 4pm.  She continued to received antibiotics for 24 hours after initiation and continued acyclovir during course of hospitalization and is still receiving doses on 2/2. Patient&#39;s initial mental status was confused, lethargic, and unable to communicate. She was intermittently oriented to herself only and would not follow commands. She would localize painful stimuli. Her mental status began to improve on Saturday when she started to become more awake but was still unable to follow commands or communicate clearly. She was moved from ICU to IMCU (step down unit) on Saturday once mental status was improving and blood pressure was stabilized. Her mental status continued to improve from Saturday 1/ 30 to Tuesday 2/2 (current). She began to have diarrhea on Saturday afternoon that continued through Monday and occurred every 1-2 hours. She was unable to stand or move body on her own and had to be assisted by staff to be cleaned. She remained awake and alert and was able to get up and walk on Monday and began to eat. She continued acyclovir treatment pending HSV meningitis panel PCR results (still pending currently 2/2). Mental status not currently at baseline but continuing to improve. She is also still experiencing generalized weakness. Hospitalist team and infectious disease doctors report she should be discharged tomorrow (2/3).  No source for confusion and hypotension has been found at this time. Physician team think HSV is unlikely but awaiting final diagnosis until test is resulted.

                                                The vaccine was given on 2/9/21. No initial pain or problems. 4 days later, my stomach felt like a feather was tickling it, then turned hot, red, itchy, a rash formed and then hives covered my torso--stomach, chest, neck, and around the injection site. On Wednesday, 2/17/21, I saw my doctor who prescribed prednisone which I began taking on Thursday. The itchy feeling subsided but hives still visible. The doctor said the reaction is not life-threatening.

Thursday around 8:30 pm I noticed a full body lumpy hive type of rash.  It wasn?t really itchy so I?m not betta in exactly when it started.  I took Benadryl at time of seeing it and contacted my doctor. I had a virtual visit and they prescribed prednisone for 5 days which I finish today.  The rash lessened by Friday around 6pm and was mostly gone by Saturday when I woke up.  I am having allergy testing and taking Claritin daily as my throat still at times feels itchy.  I did finish an new antibiotic the morning of the vaccine.

                                                A few hours after vaccination, I began to feel like I was getting ill, with fatigue and headache. I also experienced swelling at site of injection, along with hives on my face and neck on the same side as the injection. I had swelling in my neck, throat, tongue, lips, ears and eyes with some tingling. There was a red pallor on both of my cheeks. I also had slightly labored breathing. I took antihistamines and tylenol which helped reduce the symptoms within an hour. If I did not continue to take these round the clock for the next 4 days, the symptoms would get worse. Toward the end of the day, symptoms worsened regardless of antihistamine or tylenol and continue to do so as of yesterday, 1/3/2021. Symptoms have gotten better over the last 4 days. Its hard to say if I am fully recovered as in the evenings when I&#39;m more fatigued, I still have the tingling and mild swelling although the redness and hives have abated.

Arm started to feel sore as the day went on and was very sore by nighttime. Next day, arm started to feel better and over the next 3 days was no longer sore.  On the morning of the 30th, woke up feeling fine, took a 3.5 mile walk and felt fine. Around 12:30 pm, experienced sudden pain and a burning sensation in the chest and both upper arms. Thought it was possibly heartburn ; took a Prilosec. The discomfort (mild but steady) continued so checked blood pressure which was 141/91. Called cardiologist and went to emergency room per instruction, around 1:30. Admitted overnight with the diagnosis of a mild heart attack and performed a heart catheterization where they found no major blockage. One artery noted 30% blocked but that overall heart function looked good. Discharged on 12/31/2020. -reported by patient via email, on 1/3/2021 @ 4:49pm

                                                Approximately 8 days after receiving the Moderna injection, I had a reaction in my upper arm (left arm-the one I received the vaccination in).  My upper arm broke out in what looked like a bright red rash in the area of the injection.  The first thing that happened was it started itching, so I scratched it, then realized the area was very warm, so I looked and noticed the bright red color of it.  Also, at the same time, the area felt almost bruised when I scratched, but it wasn&#39;t bruised to look at, maybe under the skin it was bruised?  It got to be about 4 inches by 2-3 inches and then within a couple days, it went away.  I did put hydrocortisone cream on it off and on. As an interesting aside---when I had the first dose of Shingrix I broke out with a rash below the area where they gave me the vaccination.  This rash happened within a day or so of the vaccine, whereas with the Moderna, it was a tad more than a week later.  This was also my left arm.  With Shingrix though, it was a bit larger and raised up a bit.  That only lasted for a few days also.  I don&#39;t remember which arm I had the second Shingrix vaccine in, but I do not remember any adverse reaction after receiving it.

                                                2-3 minutes after the vaccination I developed a very fast heart rate, had a strange taste in my mouth, and for a brief second I thought my throat would close in.  I was immediately taken to the ER and monitored for about 2 hours.  During that time I had about 4 episodes of my heart rate going very high. I was told 120-150 beats/m. I was also told that I had PVC&#39;s and PAC&#39;s. I was released after 2 hours and had  another episode of a  fast heart rate on my way home. Since then I have had daily episodes of fast heart rate but not as long and not as intense.  Last episode was 2 days ago.

I was called over to assess her. She was flushed in the face, BP was 134/80 with pulse of 80, regular.  She denied shortness of breath or chest discomfort.  She was wearing a warm sweater and hat, so we removed the hat and transferred her by wheelchair to a cooler area.  She was still feeling weak, so we initiated a 911 call for EMS evaluation.  EMS arrived on site within 4 minutes and performed evaluation.  Pt was less flushed and stated she felt much better. She was not transported. Left clinic with her husband.  I called her today to follow up.  Other than some site tenderness and feeling &#34;a little light headed&#34; this morning, she feels fine.  She stated that she took ibuprofen for the injection site tenderness.  Her entire episode at the clinic last about 12-14 minutes from onset to time she left with her husband.

                                                Delayed hypersensitivity reaction at injection site.  Onset 8 days post-injection.  Area approx. 5&#34; long 3&#34; wide.  Well-demarcated oval area of slight erythema and very mild swelling.  Principal symptom is pruritus.  Slightly tender to touch but no pain unless it is pressed on.  No systemic adverse reactions experienced.   Today, day 9 post-injection reaction is similar to date of onset but no worse.  I am just applying some topical cortisone and benadryl creams to reduce the itching.  I thought I should submit this so you would have this in your data base. I have not experienced this type of reaction to any other vaccine I have received in the past but it is similar to the type of reaction I develop a few days after being stung by a bee. I anticipate a full recovery and look forward to getting my second dose of the vaccine despite this  localized adverse allergic reaction.

I called out sick and had to use a vacation day because still had headache, fogginess, and temp of 98.8.  At 3pm I started to have a lower back ache that went in to my mid back.  I was tired.  Then on Tuesday, 01/12/2021 I started with diarrhea at 11AM.  I called work and explained that it was a side effect of the Covid vaccine.  They still would not let me go to work even though I was covid negative.  I took 2 Imodium tablets. I will email you tomorrow, 1/13/2021 and continue to monitor.  Yes I am a RN.

                                                On 12/31 finished having dinner. Thought sudden slight shortness of breath may be do to appetizer type foods we had. Drank water to help subside it with little effect. Went outside into cold air. Still had some slight shortness of breath. At 8PM continued to my other daughters home( where I&#39;ve been going since pandemic) upon sitting there still felt slight shortness of breath but again manageable. We left at 11:30 as my breathing never really got better or worse. When I arrived home I Took my PROAIR-HFA inhaler that I use PRN. My symptoms resolved and went to bed. On Friday 1/1 I had again slight shortness of breath with no real excertion.  On 1/2 I went to work at Hospital in neurology dept. I was pushing collector up to SICU unit and then to M2 unit. On arrival to M2 I felt very winded and took my inhaler with results.  I then called my manager to make him aware that I was having dilemma do to fact that I didn&#39;t want to call Covid hot line as I felt symptoms were from vaccine not Covid!  I was put out of work by Covid hot line had test on 1/4 and negative results on 1/6. My symptoms seemed to subside on 1/6. I returned to work on 1/9 and am pushing collectors and patients with no symptoms

                                                Received my Covid 19 vaccine on 1/2/21.   On 1/3/21 my left upper arm where I received vaccine was extremely sore for about 48 hours.  Then on 1/8/21 I woke up to pain in my left armpit.  I had a large lump there that was painful to touch.  I am sure it is a swollen lymph lode.  As of todays date 1/13/21 the pain is gone but swelling is still there but has gone down a lot and no longer painful.

                                                Started to notice an area on my left side clavicle/base neck that felt like a marble that moved when touched on Sun.1/17,stayed the same until I woke up on Tue 1/19 (6:00am)with swelling of that area and there was a very thin red line approx. 4 inches long over the area of swelling. During the day the red line faded until it was gone around 3:00pm. Still some swelling, not as bad as when I woke up.

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.

I took Ibuprofen and drank lots of water and returned to bed.  I was drenched with sweat when I awoke for the day.  I felt fair the 28th when I went to work and by that afternoon, my temperature raised a degree up to 100.3 with feelings of general malaise.  I continued to take Ibuprofen.  I took Ibuprofen during the night on the 29th and again had broke a fever; the neck of my pajamas were soaked.  My left deltoid is still very painful as of the 29th as I type this.  Swollen, hard with red area in the center.

Besides prescription non narcotic cough meds, zyrtec and the rounds of Advair and antibiotics...I tried nose washes, humidifiers, vics inhalers, menthalatum, nyquil, etc. etc.

I had no energy, very lethargic. Got a fever by mid morning. Chills, hot and cold off an on all day. Not much of an appetite. Thursday I woke up feeling fine, however arm was still pretty sore.  By late Thursday night I started seeing a red rash on my left arm (injection site) It continued to spread all over my body for the next few days. Legs are very itchy and red.  Used an anti itch cream, took a Claritin antihistamine.  No real pain, but uncomfortable with the itching.

I gradually became more fatigued, lost my appetite for food, and the left armpit lymph nodes began swelling.  Then I started having chills and sweats.  This lasted for approximately 2 and a half days.  On day three, the fever broke, and all adverse side effects slowly began to reverse.  On day four, theupper arm and  lymph nodes were still slightly swollen, but no longer bothered me.

                                                Moderna dose 2 received at 1605. Patient reported funny taste and throat tightness. Oral diphenhydramine liquid 25mg was given. Tongue swelling and mild stridor were noted, prompting administration of an epinephrine pen and EMS was called. SpO2 noted to be in high 70s, along with persistent symptoms, so she was given an additional epinephrine pen as well as 100mg IM hydrocortisone. She was started on a 15L non-rebreather mask, IV was placed in the left antecubital space, and intubation kit was pulled from cart. Tongue and stridor improved after these doses of epinephrine and hydrocortisone. Blood pressure 190s systolic from 170s systolic after first epinephrine dose, with HR 116 at this point, and SpO2 99%. As EMS arrived, diphenhydramine 25mg IV was administered. At that point, tongue size and stridor were noted to have worsened again, so a third epinephrine pen was administered prior to EMS transport. Patient received racemic epinephrine inhalation nebulizer in EMS. Further treatment administered in ED: LR, dexamethasone and famotidine. Patient admitted later that day for further monitoring given hypertensive status. Put on scheduled cetirizine, famotidine, and dexamethasone and PRN albuterol and racemic epinephrine. Throughout her stay, patient continued to improve with stable vital signs and normal breathing. She was monitored for a total of 2 days and discharged home on 1/29.

The EMT brought the pt inside the building by the vaccine area where I quickly assessed her and administered 0.3mg of EpiPen AutoInjector.  The pt&#39;s lips gradually became more swollen, pt was able to talk and breath.  Pt refused 911 or other escort but agreed to go to the ED herself as she was with her husband.  Despite counseling, pt still refused 911. A public Health RN followed them to the ED and assured they were taken back quickly.  Pt was in the ED being seen within 8 minutes of the epi administration.  I called the ED to check on this pt about 60 minutes later and she was stable and planned to be discharged in a few hours.

                                                Within the night I felt pain on the insde area of  the FOREARM of the injected arm. The pain was something I have never felt before. A pain like I had been hit on the arm.  The pain was not intense ALL night and it did not keep me awake all night. The following day I felt the pain again, same place, but only for a half hour or so.  I have not felt that pain since, but there remains a swelling and hard lump in the place I felt the pain, with a slight pain if pressed. The lump and swelling remains constant. No worse, not sure if any better either.  No redness, and not hot to the touch. No other swelling anywhere else. Other reactions are just a slight overall sluggish feeling, that is better after sleep.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection a warm/hot tingling sensation began in my body rising up from my chest to my head. My throat and chest became tight. My heart began to race. It was difficult to breath. I motioned for help. A physician on site came over. Emergency services was called. An EKG was done in the rescue. It was normal.  Most of the symptoms resolved approximately 20 minutes later. I did not go to the hospital.  I left feeling not completely right with some discomfort in my chest.  One week later my right arm at the injection site became hot and red 4 inches by 3 inches by 4 inches around and the soreness returned.  It is still slightly pink with soreness.

                                                Moderate to severe headache, &#34;foggy&#34; thinking - felt as though it was difficult to think or process what others were saying. I could not think clearly and made simple but yet important mistakes. I also felt moderately dizzy, especially standing up. No appetite. These symptoms lasted until Wednesday, Jan 6th, at 1730. At 1730 I suddenly felt clear headed and coherent. Duration of symptoms was 49 hrs. The sudden clarity and no longer dizzy was interesting and unexpected and noticeable.  The symptoms were fast onset and sudden termination.  Only a mild headache for an additional 24hrs.

I was given Benadryl 25mg by mouth and escorted to the ER by administration.  While in the ER I was given anther Benadryl 25mg, Prednisone 40mg by mouth and epinephrine 0.3 mg injection. After about an hour I was discharged home with a prescription of prednisone 20mg to take for 10 days. I have been taking the prednisone and Benadryl 25-50 mg every 8 hours since the reaction occurred. I still have a rash on my body today and some red dots on body today also.

After lunch, 2:30 pm , I started getting stomach cramps, which progressed from 3:00 into the evening to be pretty much unbearable to about 8:00pm. Then I broke out into a sweat, I got very hot and needed to be wipe down with a cold towels. I took my temp, but it registered as low (may not be right ). I had to lay in a fetal position to go to sleep. Awoke at 3: 30 with same symptoms. woke back up at 4 with mild cramping, and it felt like food poisoning.  I am still having mild cramping and nausea.

                                                On or about 09:40-09:45 I felt a heaviness on the left side of my tongue and a general unwellness feeling, the heaviness persisted  and then as then somewhat of a continued presence that did not go away, later followed by a metallic taste in my mouth.  As I previously had a reaction to the first H1N1 vaccine years ago, I notified the person administering the vaccine before hand and also the nurse after the vaccine who was making her rounds.  I called her over to left her know I felt a little off/different, and described what I was feeling.  She escorted me to a private area where I was further assessed and given Benadryl 25mg po x 2.  The feeling never left my tongue and reportedly there was notation of questionable welts on the left side of my tongue. .I was able to speak clearly and swallow.  I was monitored and then discharged in the company of two of my colleagues (one an ICU nurse who works with me, and the other an ICU MD/anesthesiologist) who happened to be getting their vaccinations at the same time.  The tongue feeling did not leave me until late the next day and my lips felt a little off that night of the vaccine and the next day.  I continued to take the Tylenol and allegra as well as Benadryl.  By Friday night(1/8) I was feeling better, enough to work the weekend. Tylenol helped greatly for pain at injection site.  Today (1/12) I&#39;m feeling not my best and  tired like yesterday but I had a busy weekend at work (RN in the COVID ICU), some malaise and achy (maybe my fibromyalgia or the weather), minor headache and fatigued, had a minor sore throat this am that has resolved, and Tylenol has resolved the headache.  Not sure if this needed to be included but I thought I&#39;d mention it.

Palms of my hands were flame red and painful. Went to ER - that day (30th)- husband took me. I took Benadryl 50 mg right away. ER gave me Decadron 8 mg PO and Racemic Epi Aerosol treatment and got lactated ringers; IV fluid. Treatments resolved issue. Dec 23 I was negative for COVID nasal swab test (as husband had been positive for it); Dec 26, I was positive for COVID nasal swab (had to test to go to work).I had no COVID symptoms. The 30th is when I developed the allergic reaction. About 31st - started having ear pain and lymph nodes swollen on opposite side of shot. January 3rd, 2021 Went to Urgent Care and I had an ear infection. January 3 had an ear infection. I never get an ear infection normally.

                                                After receiving the injection I experienced slight soreness at the injection site, which was expected.  later that evening I experienced swelling in the left axilla lymph nodes. The swelling in that area was extreme on 01/20/2021 throughout the night and has continued until day of reporting on 01/27/2021. The pain and swelling involved the entire underarm and pain could be felt deep in the tissue. On pain scale of 1-10 with 10 as extreme, I would rate pain as a 9 on days 1-5. Pain has gradually diminished in severity on subsequent days and is a 2 today. Measures to reduce the pain included elevation of arm and shoulder during the night, discontinuation of deodorant during period of discomfort and application of warm and cold compresses to decrease pain and swelling.  Initially contemplated seeking emergency room evaluation and treatment for evaluation , but decided against because there is no way to remove the vaccine and treatment would probably include measures already implemented.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medication use was not provided by the reporter.   On 23 Dec 2020, immediately prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The physician reported that she was injected with the vaccine abruptly and roughly. She noticed a bump at the injection site right away. The nurse applied a cold compress. Later that day, she realized it was a clot.   On 24 Dec 2020, she had swelling, bruising from her upper arm to her elbow, and the area was hot and tender.   On 30 Dec 2020, she went to the emergency room where an ultrasound showed extravasation in the tissues. She was treated with cephalexin for cellulitis.   On 01 Jan 2021, the bump began to subside; however, there was a large black area that started to peel. The reporter stated it looked like a chemical burn.  On an undisclosed date, there was a large scar in its place.   Treatment for the events included a cold compress and cephalexin.    The reporter stated she is unsure whether it was intramuscular.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The event, scar, was not resolved. The outcome of the events, bump/clot at the injection site, swelling, bruising from upper arm to elbow, feeling hot, tenderness, extravasation in tissues, vaccination site cellulitis, a big blackened area, chemical burn, and peeling, were considered resolving. The event, unsure whether is was intramuscular, was resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of incorrect route of administration for mRNA-1273 and concerns a 59 year-old, female patient, who experienced the events of bump/clot at the injection site, swelling, bruising from upper arm to elbow, feeling hot, tenderness, extravasation in tissues, vaccination site cellulitis, a big blackened area, scar, chemical burn and peeling. The event of bump/clot at the injection site occurred the same day after the first and only dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. The events of swelling, bruising from upper arm to elbow, feeling hot, tenderness occurred the next day after the vaccine administration.  The events of extravasation in tissues, vaccination site cellulitis occurred 7 days after the vaccine administration. The events of a big blackened area, scar, chemical burn and peeling occurred 9 days after the vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

I called my son (son is a doctor) he said if my heart beat goes over 110 then I needed to call 911. It lasted till about 4 AM and I was able to sleep. Everything the pain and heartbeat both started to go  down. My heartbeat to went back down to 85. In the morning I was fine.

                                                redness and swelling at the time of injection.  Was told to ice and take Tylenol.   Redness and warm to the touch continued.  I caught a cold and went to Urgent care to take a COVID test so I could return to work.  I had the Dr.  look at my arm  while I was there.  He said I had cellulitis and put me on antibiotics for 10 days.  It is slowly getting better.

                                                8 days post vaccine started having symptoms at upper left arm.No problems with injection site intially other than mild soreness. Symptoms of  swelling, itching, redness, soreness upper right arm began on day 8 post vaccine that worsened over 3 days and then began to subside.  Symptoms cleared up within in 7 days of onset. Visited Immediate Care; HCP stated it appeared to be mild cellulitis. Rx for antibiotic was prescribed but I never took the antibiotic and symptoms cleared on their own.

                                                Dizziness for several hours, sleepiness for three days, arm pain getting worse the day after the vaccine (it hurt from the right side of the neck to he finger tips ranging from severe on the site of the shot to more mild in the neck and finger tips), joint pain for several days, nausea a few minutes after the first meal of the day for several days, mild swelling of the body during the day of the vaccination(delay reaction).  For the dizziness I had a banana and potato chips to stabilize the sugar in the blood and took about and hour nap.  Co-workers and Supervisor monitor me in case EMS needed to be call. For the pain in general I took 1 capsule Tylenol 500.  Nothing for the nausea and plenty of water to reduce swelling.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction. Shot given around 9am. Around 11am symptoms appeared: extremely hot/flushed, nauseated, felt ill, difficulty swallowing. Went to pharmacist who had me sit down, within 30 seconds could not swallow. Pharmacist injected me with Epi Pen and called 911. Paramedics arrived gave more epinephrine, oxygen, started breathing treatment. Lost my voice as throat started to tighten more. Taken to Hospital where I was given Benadryl, steroids, stomach meds, more fluids and another breathing treatment since my lungs were so tight, I could only take shallow breaths. The crated my lungs, did blood work and kept me overnight for observation because I have a history of secondary reactions when I experience anaphylaxis. I was released from the hospital on 2/20/2021 at 2pm.
