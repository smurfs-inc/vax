                                                I woke up at approximately 4:00 am with an extremely dry mouth. I went into the bathroom and took a drink of water. I returned to bed. I noticed that my breathing was becoming more rapid. I had trouble catching my breath. I sat up on the side of the bed. My heart was pounding and quick. My breathing was difficult. I woke up my wife. After about 5 minutes my symptoms improved. She took my pulse which was now at 62ppm.  I laid back down in a reclined position. My symptoms of difficulty breathing and elevated heart rate quickly returned. My pulse was now up to 98 ppm.  I sat up again. My symptoms gradually improved. Being unsure of what was going on my wife called 911.  The ambulance arrived in about 8 minutes.  I was about 60% better. Vitals were improving other than my blood pressure which was 180/100 Being unsure of what was happening, I was transported to Hospital.   I  had a chest x-ray, a chest CT scan with contrast to rule out a blood clot, blood work including tests to rule out MI x2. All test were negative.  By about 6:30 am I was feeling at least 80% better. My breathing I felt had returned to normal. My pulse was down into the 50&#34;s which is my normal range.

                                                DVT blood clot; A spontaneous report was received from a 60-year-old male consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) blood clot.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included factor V Leiden, enlarged prostate, DVT, pulmonary embolism and hypertension. Concomitant medications reported included valsartan, alfuzosin, and acetylsalicylic acid.   On 07 Jan 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011J20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient developed DVT blood clot and experienced leg pain so intense that he could not walk. A doppler exam showed the DVT was from the top of the calf to mid-thigh. Treatment for the event included a rivaroxaban starter pack with dose tapering.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event deep vein thrombosis (DVT) blood clot was not reported.  The outcome of the event, DVT blood clot, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 60-year-old male patient with a relevant medical history of factor V Leiden, DVT, pulmonary embolism and hypertension who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011J20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Patient experienced the medically significant unlisted event of Deep vein thrombosis approximately four days after administration of vaccine. Treatment for the event included rivaroxaban. Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the event occurring after receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event of Deep vein thrombosis is possibly related to the product. Of note, the patient&#39;s underlying Factor V Leiden which predispose to developing abnormal blood clots, and prior medical history of DVT with pulmonary embolism are considered risk factors to the occurrence of the event.

It retuned to normal after 6 hours, and then occurred again 1 week later...for 6 hours. I took Bystolic, and about 8 hours later it returned to baseline (about 62/min.  on Sun 1/24/2021, I woke up to bloody diarrhea x several episodes...this continued until Wed 27th, at which time my son (a 4th year graduating MD student) drove me to hospital and I was seen in ER room by MD. I was admitted, and had emergency surgery 1/27/2021 straight from Er Room. I had life saving surgery the next day to stop a lower GI bleed (of unknown origin). I was discharged 3 days later, and I am awaiting more testes, appts, etc.... I have lost time, money, and work from this near death experience... and the tachycardia still needs to be followed up on . I am EXTREMELY upset by these events, as I almost died....was hospitalized, incurred a lot of expense, used up all my sick pay and personal days, and out-of -pocket to my healthcare insurer.

                                                approximately 24  hours after the injection, I had no fever, but chills, sweats and overall since of fatigue.   My resting heart rate was at 100 for a few hours.  Normally, it&#39;s around 76.    I noticed on deep breaths, I felt the need to cough (no phlegm, just a dry cough.  One or two coughs per attempt).  No medical care sought.    Those symptoms dissipated and I felt good.  Then on January 20 and 21, the chills returned.  They lasted about 8-10 hours, then they were gone.  I also developed a headache during the 20 and 21 episodes.  I checked yes in the below adverse recovery box, but I am uncertain as to what tonight and the rest of the days have in store.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

                                                The night of my vaccination I went to bed early. I was tired and a little achey. I woke up about 2:00 AM with significant discomfort in my chest. My chest felt heavy and when I inhaled it felt like someone was squeezing both lobes of my lungs. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to urinate. I went back to bed and tried to get back to sleep. The discomfort in my chest continued and seemed to get worse. I got back out of bed at about 2:45 AM and went downstairs where I walked around my living room to see if that would help me feel better. I continued to feel severe discomfort in my chest and lungs. I did not otherwise feel bad. I was not congested. I could  still take a deep breath but it hurt to do so.  I took my temperature and I did not have a fever. At about 3:00 AM I woke up my wife and she drove me to the emergency room at Medical Center. On the car ride to the hospital I started to feel much better. By the time I checked into the emergency room most of my discomfort had dissipated and only a very slight feeling of heaviness remained in my chest.

                                                experienced extreme shortness of breath a day or two after receiving 2nd COVID-19 vaccine. Breathing became worse at night, more so in reclined position than upright. Thinking it was a vaccine side effect waited for it to subside, when it did not sought medical attention. Doctors determined to be acute congestive heart failure exacerbation. Treated with diuretics and blood pressure medications. Hospitalized from 3/14/2021 to 3/19/2021.

                                                Patient was monitored for 1 hour after receiving his vaccine as requested by his primary care provider due to history of reaction to a previous vaccine. Patient monitored by EMS provider x 1hr, no s/s adverse reaction. Patient started walking out of facility on his own and came back reporting he felt dizzy. He was initially hypertensive with a pulse of 70, respiratory rate 12, systolic BP 188.  We had him lay down and about 10 minutes later his blood pressure was 140/70.   After another 10 minutes or so we had him sit and drink water but his dizziness, while improved, did not go away and he started to have chills and was visibly shaking so 911 was called as we did not feel he could drive himself home. Patient was monitored in the emergency department at Hospital x 1hr and released with blood pressure WNL.

He is currently admitted at a different hospital.   After vaccine administration on-site, the patient became unconscious for a few minutes. However, this is common for him - he informed us that he almost always &#34;passes out&#34; after vaccine administration. He slowly returned to consciousness without any issues. He was seen by an ED physician prior to leaving the facility. Deemed to be in good health, patient also stated that he felt fine and believed he was okay to leave as these episodes occur frequently following vaccination.

The outcome of the events COVID-19 and bronchitis was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report concerns a 63-year-old male patient who experienced the serious events of COVID-19 and bronchitis. The event occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of the vaccine mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot #: Unknown, expiration date-Unknown). Treatment administered included antibiotics and steroids. Outcome was unknown. Although a temporal association exist, there is not enough information to adequately assess the causal association between the reported events and mRNA-1273 vaccine administration.  Critical details such as diagnostic test for COVID infection prior to vaccination was not ascertained. Causality is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.

No heart beat pulse etc... used CPR machines and paddles  Patient had walked 6 1/2 miles that morning no problems did about 50-60 miles weekly outside. This was sudden and me, his wife, say it was a reaction to something in shot that contributed to this event- there is absolutely nothing you could say to make believe differently. This happened 1 1/2 hours after getting shot.

Pain is substernal, radiated to the left arm, associated with lightheadedness.  Denies diaphoresis or nausea.  Per EMS there were short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia  3/18: - remains inpatient admission as of 3/18/21 @ 0900 63 y.o. male with a past medical history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He states he was lifting a couch yesterday and his heart started beating fast.  He did not really have any chest pain, but felt a little bit lightheaded.  He called an ambulance and they brought into the ER.  In the emergency room his EKG did show some frequent PVCs.  However, he did not really require any intervention.  He was given 3 nitro, but it really did not make any difference in the way he was feeling.  The patient denies multiple times that he actually had chest pain.  He states he just felt like his heart was beating funny.  The patient&#39;s most recent stress test was a nuclear stress test in May of 2019.  Overnight, the patient has felt very well.  He denies any significant chest pain.  He denies any further heart palpitations.  On the monitor he would occasionally going to bigeminy, which is not abnormal for him.  EKG this morning was unremarkable.   After speaking with the patient&#39;s wife, she told me that he has had a several month history of very limited exertion.  She states every time he exerts he becomes extremely dyspneic and has heart palpitations and sometimes almost passes out.  She states last night he was extremely diaphoretic and very nearly passed out.

Into the evening I started getting beyond normal reaction.  I had a very stiff shoulder joint with pain, beyond that of my existing condition.  It was severe the next day.  Saw my doctor, for the first time meet, and mentioned the reaction I got, but he said it will go away.  During the doctor visit I had elevated BP identified, which wasn&#39;t normal for me either.  That evening I had additional symptoms that included swelling at the proximal points on the thumb and index finger, this also included the wrist.  All symptoms have since subsided to normal.  No other symptoms.

Discharged per wheel chair to lobby in alert/stable condition, to wait on bus to take him home. At 18:00 his neighbor heard him fall, could not get patient to answer phone, found him unresponsive. Neighbor called 9-1-1, ambulance personnel could not revive patient.  Coroner&#39;s office ruled his death as Natural Causes due to Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Diabetes, ESRD.  There were no indication of anaphylactic reaction noted when I questioned the coroner&#39;s office. The Coroner&#39;s office/EMS were aware the patient had received the Moderna COVID 19 vaccination that day.

                                                Began feeling very weak with a constant headache that later led to blurry vision on March, 2, 2021.  On the morning of March 4, 2021,  I was still experiencing a right sided headache as well as double vision.  I was no longer able to drive at that point.  I took my blood pressure digitally at the local pharmacy twice where it was 200/104.  I went home to call my physician and also have my wife take my blood pressure manually.  My blood pressure at that time was 214/106.  I went to the hospital where they examined me and then discharged me with a General Headache without a know cause.  I contacted my PCP and he advised me to quadruple my Lisinopril until my BP came down to normal range and see him the morning.  My visit the next day showed an elevated blood pressure, double vision, and a continuing headache.  My meds were adjusted to Lisinopril 10 mg qd and an addition of Norvasc 5 mg qd.  Later that day my blood pressure was down, but still not in the normal range.   The following day, March 6, 2021, I was still having the same issues despite the changes in medication.  I took my blood pressure at 6 pm and it was 199/104.  I immediately went to another hospital where I was admitted as  a &#34;stroke alert&#34; patient in hypertensive emergency.  I am presently being followed as an inpatient in order to get these issues under control.

                                                65 Y male who is referred for c/f dyspnea and chest pain.  Per clinic notes: &#34;Brief summary covid vaccine 1/21 with side effect within 12 hr lasting 3 d By around 1/26-1/29 had cp w/ exertion and sob TST 2/2 w/  Minor ekg changes and min workload per pt (mod workload per note) nuc study pending.  Cough and sob worse over the last 5 d or so, sleeping in recliner, and having trouble sleeping.  Though no desat on march test, he has freq intermittent coughing and he was tachycardic to 110 on exam this am.&#34;   Pt states symptoms worsening over past week. No symptoms at rest. With exertion has anterior chest tightness and dyspnea. No radiation of pain or migration. He can walk usual distances but much slower. Improved at rest. Cannot lay flat at night. Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

                                                Prior to the vaccine on 2/13/21, He was a healthy 65 year old active college professor.   32 hours after the vaccination on 2/14/21, He had acute pancreatitis, which led to  septic shock and respiratory failure, and he was placed on a ventilator at  Hospital.   On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

                                                Pt received 1st dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 01/04/2021 in L deltoid. Came back to clinic at 0800 on 01/06/2021 c/o excruciating pain in entire L arm radiating to neck, chest, and around his upper and lower back. States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

                                                syncope, c/o itchy throat Narrative: Patient was seen prior to administration of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. He has allergies to bees/egg and a h/o anaphylaxis 2/2 receiving an injection of penicillin in the past. Discussed that prior h/o anaphylaxis to PCN injection was not a contraindication to this vaccination, but is a precaution. Discussed risks of receiving the vaccination vs benefits of the vaccine, which patient states &#34;I already had this discussion with Dr.!&#34; He has multiple comorbidities which place him at a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. Again received the risk vs benefit discussion. Patient stated understanding and desire to proceed with the vaccination. He will be monitored for at least 30 minutes in area where staff can directly observe him. Patient received the COVID vaccination at 13:00. At 45 minutes later, staff alerted that he was c/o palpitations. Due to confusion and weakness, we were unable to transport him to an examination room. Oxygen, water, and vitals machine were brought to him. He presented with SOB, confusion, lightheadedness. Exam demonstrated acute distress, speaking in staccato sentences. HR in 80s, with lungs CTAB and no stridor - despite increased RR to 20s. Vitals with HR in 70s, SpO2 remained 97% or greater on RA. BP was initially 140/72. A code blue was called and Drs. presented to the area. Patient c/o itchy throat and still p/w confusion/combativeness, loss of orientation, and SOB. No visible swelling noticed. At around 13:58, patient syncopized. HR and SpO2 remained 70-80s and &gt;98% on room air respectively. Pulse remained palpable. At that time, an epipen was administered. Patient woke up. During the entire episode, he was able to recognize a staff member with whom he was previously familiar. EMS arrived, vitals remained stable. EMS transported patient to the ER for further monitoring and f/u. Concern for immediate allergic reaction 2/2 vaccination. After event, patient in need of referral to allergy provider for evaluation prior to consideration of 2nd dosage.

At time of scheduling I was told that I could get my second vaccination at facility, which was  about 50 miles closer to my home.  The scheduler verified that facility administered both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.   On 2/16, when I reported to facility for my second shot, I reminded the intake person and the one who escorted me to the vaccination station that I needed the Pfizer vaccine, and was told by both people that  Pfizer was in the record and that I would receive that vaccine.  The person who escorted me to the vaccination station brought the syringe to the vaccinator, who asked me my name and date of birth, administered the shot, and handed me the post-administration paperwork.  While seated in the waiting area I read over my paperwork and reviewed my dosage record card and discovered, that I had been  given the Moderna vaccine., against the CDC guidance and without prior notification to or authorization by me.  I have subsequently experienced shortness of breath, an unusually high level of  nasal congestion, nad a serious lack of energy.  These symptoms began about 72 hours after the second vaccination.

                                                He complained of dizziness the evening of the shot.  He went to bed and when he woke up the next morning he was having double vision.  Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

Patient had a syncopal episode on the toilet prior to EMS call. EMS notes they gave patient 4 epinephrine, 1 bicarbonate, and 1 Narcan. Patient arrived with a lucas machine in place and intubated. Patient&#39;s intubation was verified to be a 7.0 ETT and 23 cm at the lip. Cardiac Activity noted in ED at 2150. See nurses notes for times medications were administered. Further history limited due to unstable vital signs. Pt hypotensive, started and maxed on levophed, epinephrine infusions and additional push dose epi given.  Right femoral central line placed.  Pt began to brady down, was given atropine, ultimately again became pulseless and CPR resumed.  After 2 further rounds of ACLS, total down time approached 1 hour without return of pulse.  On echo, there were occasional agonal beats, but no organized cardiac activity.  EKG and case had been discussed with Dr. Friday and decision was to attempt therapeutic hypothermia prior to second cardiac arrest as EKG showed inferolateral STEMI

They declined to help and blamed Tandum and transferred to them. They said NO NO this is a Dexcom problem and transferred me back! Dexcom identified the problem and offed to send a replacement vis 3-7 days vis ground shipping! A week without a CGM sensor!!! I expressed concern and asked for overnight. One week ago I got the Moderna vaccine and suffered Diabetic Ketoacidosis. Failed sensor has resulted in elevated BG. Last week I had Ketoacidosis following moderna Covid-19 vaccine. Being without continuous BG testing is dangerous. Raised my concerns with Dexcom. Asked for call back and action.

Pt was found to have elevated BTNP at 2240 pg/ml with fluid overload, and Biofire Respiratory Panel showed Coronavirus PCR positive.  At that time, his COVID markers were also elevated.  CRP 91.4 mg/L,  D-Dimer 2340 ng/mL.  Patient was admitted, diuresed, and started on inpatient COVID protocol which included Ivermectin.  March 9:  EKG was performed and patient was found to have a heart block.  All labs had improved over the past 48 hrs. BTNP reduced to 1530, D-Dimer reduced to  1700, CRP reduced to 47.9.   Due to the heart block, patient was transferred to a care center to a cardiologist.  Just prior to transfer, a follow up Biofire respiratory panel showed Coronavirus PCR NEGATIVE.  PCR positive and negative results were relayed to accepting facility - facility and they were going to refer to epidemiology for follow up.

                                                I suffered a heart attack on March 11, 2021, at approx 145pm, while sitting at my desk - WFH.  My symptoms were sweats, nausea, followed by chest pains beginning on the left side of my chest; sweats and nausea subsided for approx 1 hr, returning again, followed by chest pains radiating  the across the full chest approx.  I left my desk at the onset to wash my face, returning to my desk to talk a scheduled phone call at 2pm, lasting until 3pm.  I left desk to walk outside to take in some fresh air, my wife ask me if I was ok, I said no.  She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.  Shortly thereafter I was taking to the Cath lab where a stent was insert and then taken to ICU.  Where I remained until I was released on 3/12/2021 at 3pm.  There was no detectable heart damage and I was placed a regime of blood thinner, a beta blocker and cholesterol med.  I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or history of heart problems.  My last physical was Feb 2021.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                Ongoing issues with migrating joint and muscle aches. Initially I took  advil. After 2 weeks my GP prescribed a medrol dose pak that got rid of symptoms immediately and for the duration of the treatment. When the meds were over the symptoms came back to a lesser degree. The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

                                                The patient noted weakness starting in the legs on January the 19th, 10 days  after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.  The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

States patient died at home on 1/15 a.m.  Physician who stated she was called to the patient&#39;s home @ 0157 1/15/2021 and found cyanotic from head to toe.  State girlfriend found him sitting in the chair a few minutes before they called her.  The Coroner did not order autopsy.  Did not sent patient to the hospital.  Sent him directly Funeral Home.  Death Certificate Number 123-2021-002593 list cause of death as pending.  I spoke with the patient&#39;s primary doctor who gave me the history of HTN, Diabetes, &amp; High Cholesterol.  States he had not seen this patient since April 2020.  They were also friends and he was not aware of any medical problems.   The Coroner state she thinks patient has a heart attack.   Neither the Coroner nor PMD think death was related to COVID Vaccine.    Informed both that MSDH would have to complete VAERS.  Both voiced understanding.

Unable to sleep, no matter what medication given.   At beginning had high blood pressure which is unusual for me and heart palpitations.  Had two trips to the ER , 1-13-21  9:00 PM, released  and  1-15-21 10:00  PM and admitted, kept for one day.   Heart palpitations decreased within the first week and blood pressure came down to normal.    Unable to sleep, after being given Hydroxyzine Hydrochloride-25mg and later Alprazolam-.5 mg.   Tried taking herbs before taking Alprazolam due to the addiction factor.  Took Kava , Deep Sleep and CBD.  Took Alprazolam after herbs didn&#39;t seem to help but it made me feel bad and didn&#39;t help with the sleep so went to over the counter sleep aid.

He reported to family members that he was having a &#34;severe reaction&#34; to the vaccine and believed it was acute pericarditis due to the same symptoms he experienced prior. He reported that on 2/1/21 around 0300 hours, the symptoms were the most severe and he was going to seek medical attention, but did not. He waited till the convenient store opened and purchased OTC Tylenol for relief of symptoms. He continued to have dyspnea and chest pain up until 2/9/21, when he called 911 complaining of chest pain and was found to have a STEMI; subsequently died at Hospital in the ER.

Was evaluated in the ED for approx 6 hrs, then transferred to a room for overnight observation.

He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                After the vaccine, usually has accumulation for mucous in the nose.  Scheduled for surgery in May with ENT to expand passageway.  Has had nose bleeds before.  Woke up blew his nose, felt it running and then had severe nose bleed.  Was clotting up and then blew it out.  Also had used a chemical using his bathtub and the nosebleeds have occurred every morning for the last 3-4 days.  Anytime he gets ready to go to the doctor it stops.  Just first thing in the morning upon wakening and only after he blows his nose.  Which he called the 24-hour nurse line and she instructed him on how to stop the bleeding, and told him not to blow his nose.  He was examined by his ENT in Oct/Nov was told that he was normal other than the balloon procedure.  Is going to FU with his ENT.

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

                                                My father received the first Covid shot 3/2; he woke up 3/3 with severe body aches and weakness, which we thought nothing of.  However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

The next day I was tired and slept for the most part of the day, then that night I woke up twice with a wet bed from sweating. No appetite either day. I am feeling  better today but still a bit weak.

At on or around 8:45 PM my dad called my sister that he was having trouble breathing and felt very short of breath. My sister was there in about 7min by the time she got to him my dad was gasping for air he would lift his head up trying to breath. They got him to the hospital shorty after about a 7 min drive. My dad was taken into hospital we were not able to go in due to restrictions.

No prior medical history and concomitant medications were reported.     On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.     The patient experienced the events like severe COPD, could not breathe, had chest pressure, pressure in the neck, rapid heartrate (have extra heartbeat), premature ventricular contractions and swelling in face on 12 Feb 2021.  The reported case is serious as the events, severe COPD, could not breathe, had chest pressure, pressure in the neck, rapid heartrate (have extra heartbeat), premature ventricular contractions and swelling in face lead to hospitalization and resulted in prolonged hospitalization.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.     The outcome of the events were considered not resolved and the patient is still in.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                felt so bad; severe chest pain; Chest pain and arm pain; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning her husband, a 71-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced abnormal feeling, severe chest pain,  and arm pain.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included the patient had a heart attack on 26 May 2020 and on October 2020 the patient had five bypass, two arteries they took. Since October the patient&#39;s condition was stated to be great. Concomitant medications reported included Insulin Bovine, Multivitamins [vitamins Nos], acetylsalicylic acid and Medication related to patient&#39;s heart attack.  On 12 Feb 2021, unspecified days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:007M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Feb 2021, post receiving mRNA-1273, the patient had no reaction and did not feel bad.  On unspecified day in Feb 2021 one week prior to the reporting the events, the patient experienced chest pain and arm pain, minimum that lasted for 10 minutes. 3 or 4 night prior reporting the event, the patient was feeling abnormal, went to ER and was hospitalized with severe chest pain. The patient was in a regular room and was transferred to ICU. Next day, Cardiac catheterization was performed to see the patient&#39;s heart and found that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing.  Treatment for the event, severe chest pain included morphine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event of arm pain was considered Recovered/Resolved.  The events, abnormal feeling, severe chest pain were considered as unknown. The patient is still hospitalized.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old, male patient, who experienced severe chest pain, feeling abnormal. Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack (May 2020) and bypass (October 2020) confounds the causality. Further information has been requested.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

Given IV reglan, then ativan(1 mg) then 25mg benadryl and a liter of fluids. BP was slightly elevated 150/90 (?). Had oral temp of 99.1. When ativan didnt help they gave me a dose of dilaudid and zophran and additional dose of ativan. Then sent me home with instructions to take valium 5mg tid, orphenadrine 100mg Bid, Tylenol 650mg to 1300 mg q8hr prn and lidocaine patch on neck 5%(also started in ER) q 24hrs.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

I developed severe chills and low grade fever, muscle and joint pain, my hands and feet were cold, headache, and uncontrolled yawning, I suppose my body&#39;s attempt to cool the brain. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and the symptoms mostly abated, but returned about 4hrs later. I am treating myself with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I have not seen my PCP, I feel the symptoms will resolve with time, if not I will follow-up. I cannot find anything in the literature but do people that have had covid get a stronger reaction from the vaccine?

I took one 650 mg Acetaminophen at 0330 the following morning to reduce the fever and continued taking this at 6 hour intervals until 1/22 (today).  Also I had a headache, sore muscles and symptoms similar to the flu during this entire period.  During the first night just before taking the Acetaminophen my pulse was up to 104 bpm.  It went down during the following day to about 84 and is now at 72 bpm (9am/Jan22); my normal pulse is usually between 58 and 64 bpm.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

                                                Patient presented with sharp right lower quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and emesis beginning the day he received the COVID vaccine, after vaccine injection. He had decreased appetite and pain was made worse by eating.  He presented to the hospital 3 days (2/6/21) after receiving the vaccine/symptom onset. His vital signs were T 101.5, HR 78, BP 156/67, RR 20, SpO2 94 on RA.   As discussed below, imaging showed acalculous cholecysitis. The day after presentation, pain was more localized to RUQ.  He was treated with IV ceftriaxone and flagyl. He underwent percutaneous cholecystomy tube place on 2/7/21 with plan for delayed cholecystectomy following drain placement x 6 weeks. Bile fluid culture has been no growth. We are attempting to test bile fluid for COVID-19 via PCR.   He tested positive for COVID-19 via nasal swab RT-PCR and developed a 3L oxygen requirement and mild dyspnea. He was treated with remdesivir and dexamathasone 2/6-2/10 with resolution of hypoxia and dyspnea.

                                                Syncope; Diarrhea; Low pressure; Flu-like symptoms; A regulatory report  was received from a consumer concerning a 72-years-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, and who experienced flu-like symptoms, head went back, eyes went white, jaw move left to right, made a last breath, thought he died, diarrhea and low pressure.  The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Metoprolol succinate.  On 24 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (042L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 25 Jan 2021, the patient reported flu-like symptoms. Treatment information was not provided.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient reported head went back, eyes went white, jaw move left to right, made a last breath, thought he died, diarrhea and low pressure. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The event, flu-like symptoms was considered recovered/resolved on 25 Jan 2021.  The events, head went back, eyes went white, jaw move left to right, made a last breath, thought he died, and diarrhea was considered recovered/resolved on 26 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the event low pressure was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 72 year old male with medical history of hypertension on metoprolol, who experienced a serious unexpected event of syncope and non-serious unexpected events of flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, and low blood pressure. Event onset was 1 day after first dose of mRNA-1273. Flu-like symptoms resolved. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It was diagnosed only on Feb. 19, as I was totally unfamiliar with the symptoms and had another indication of a problem: tachycardia, so went to the clinic. I am not sure this isn&#39;t coincidental, but I have no history of embolisms, and no family history. No one at the time of my diagnosis asked when I gotten vaccine. As I said , this may be entirely coincidental, or it may not.  I am presently on eliquis blood thinners, and have had no further problems.

He had a clot in his brain and underwent brain surgery. He experienced seizures after the surgery, but it was ultimately reported the surgery went well. He remained intubated and on a ventilator after surgery. He developed complications of his lungs and kidneys while on the ventilator. Ventilator was removed 3/16/2021 and he passed away that day. The hospital providers thought the clot in the brain may have been from hitting his head over a month ago. From my understanding he was A&amp;O, independent with ADLs, and lived in his private residence prior to these complications.

                                                Seizures; Mini stroke; Tired; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 73-year-old male who received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced seizures, mini stroke, confused, agitated, eyes were abnormal, memory impairment, and tired.   The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack and stent placement in 2011. His relevant concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan cilexetil, clopidogrel bisulfate, diltiazem hydrochloride, ezetimibe, adenosine, gabapentin, metoprolol tartrate and rosuvastatin calcium.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 14 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, 30 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot#010M20A) intramuscularly in left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Feb 2021, With in 30 minutes of receiving the vaccination, the patient had a seizure. They took him to the hospital, where he had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood work and had a consult. After consult, they said, it&#39;s a mini stroke. They released him and told her if it happens again call 911. He felt so tired and went to sleep at home. Around 17:00 dinner time, he woke up looked very blankly, and his wife reported knowing he had another seizure. She reported he ran to his keys saying, &#34;I have to go&#34;, seemed confused, agitated and didn&#39;t know where he was. She called 911 andhe was transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  Around 19:00 the same day, he was admitted to do scans overnight. Around 21:00, patient&#39;s eyes were abnormal, he became agitated again and nurses confirmed he was having another seizure. 30 minutes later, he was talking to his wife and daughter as if he didn&#39;t remember anything. He mentioned some metallic taste in his mouth.  On 11 Feb 2021, they did an electroencephalogram (EEG) and confirmed that he was having seizure. He was prescribed seizure medication and released him from hospital. However, the patient and his wife reported not wanting him to take the medication as they believe the events were due to the vaccine. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with vaccine is not applicable as the patient received both the doses.  The outcomes of the events, seizures, mini stroke, and tired, were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack and concomitant medication use can be confounding factor. Further information has been requested.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there.

Stayed in the pharmacy for about 45 minutes. Felt the breathing difficulty going away so decided to drive home. The breathing difficulty came back when I reached home (a 5-minute drive).  Feel asleep; woke up after about an hour and the breathing difficulty is completely gone. Have not felt it again until this report date (1/22/21 1:16am).

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

                                                Patient passed away Saturday at 14:04pm. Patient&#39;s wife reports his death was sudden, he passed away sitting in his chair his heart just stopped she said. They tried to perform CPR, 911 was called and paramedics arrived at the scene and he was given medication but never had any return of vital signs and so his death was called at the scene. Wife reports he was not ill, did not have any symptoms prior to the event. They are not going to be doing a autopsy. She wanted us to know based on timing that there may be some possible correlation with his COVID19 vaccine. He obtained the vaccine on 02/09/2021 - wife reports he had no symptoms, not even arm soreness after the vaccine. Had no fever, shortness of breath. Did not complain of chest pain. We can update chart to reflect the patient is deceased and lets make a card for the family.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

Vaccine was administered to right deltoid.  Patient then was asked to sit in the waiting room for 15 minutes for observation.  Patient was sitting in waiting room and developed shortness of breath and dizziness.  Patient vitals signed were obtained blood pressure was elevated 150s/100, heart rate 120s, oxygen level upper 90&#39;s on room air.  Patient was brought to an exam room where he could lay down via wheelchair.  Multiple vital signs were taken during the duration of his time at the clinic.  Blood pressure did come down to 140s/90s, sats remained in  upper 90s, heart rate came down to 70-80.  Patient remained dizzy the entire time.  Patient states that he has a history of idiopathic angioedema as well as a heart stent.  Patient goes on the explain that at different times he can have swelling internally.  He has had this happen several times in the past to his abdomen, saliva glands, tongue, as well as extremities.  Patient and his wife called his primary care physician and MD advised if episode did not resolve to go to the ER.  After waiting in the clinic for around 45 minutes the patients wife decided it would be best to go to the ER.  EMS was notified. Ambulance responded.  Patient was transported via ambulance to ER.    Patient wife was called the afternoon of the incident.  She states that patient was admitted to the hospital for observation.  He was treated with Benadryl, Pepcid, Decadron; CT of head was normal; blood pressure was still elevated; and they were not sure what was the cause of the episode.  I called the patient&#39;s wife on 1-29-21 to check on patient again.  His wife stated that he was been discharged home.  They were unsure what caused the episode and to follow up with primary physician in one week.  She states that at one week follow up visit they would discuss the need/desire for second COVID vaccine.  .

                                                This gentleman was hospitalized with dyspnea, found to have a leukocytosis and probable right lower lobe pneumonia, hospitalized for IV antibiotic therapy.  He is still hospitalized but improving as of the date of this report. His COVID-19 test was negative on the day of admission. He had no symptoms out of the ordinary on the day of his vaccination. I am reporting this as it occurred in the week after his first dose of vaccine though would suspect the timing is likely coincidental rather than directly related to the vaccine.

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker. On March 12 he received a cortisone shot and required emergency medical assistance to get into a personal vehicle with a family member who drove to the appointment. The next few days, the pain persisted, became worse, and spread throughout his body. On March 16 he was transported by emergency medical services to the local emergency room for treatment and was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia. On March 18 he was still being treated when he experienced cardiac arrest while being intubated. He was resuscitated and was on a ventilator being treated for a few more days but ultimately succumbed to sepsis on March 30.
